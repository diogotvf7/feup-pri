The iPhone wasn’t just three devices in one—it was a revolution still unfolding. \uD83D\uDCB0\uD83D\uDCB8 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter \uD83D\uDCB0\uD83D\uDCB8 Apple announced a preview of Apple Intelligence this summer. This AI feature is designed to enhance Siri, auto-generate emails and images, and organize notifications. The functions will be available on Apple's latest iPhone 16s. “I love the emerging world,” Tim Cook says in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “I love the idea for a bunch of people to feel like tomorrow is better than today—the dream, the belief that you’re going to stand on your parents’ shoulders.” Related: Apple CEO Tim Cook's decision raises eyebrows The full suite of Apple Intelligence is expected to come out later this month. However, some at Apple believe the company is more than two years behind industry leaders in generative AI, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who reports that OpenAI’s ChatGPT is 25% more accurate than Apple’s Siri and can answer 30% more questions. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Apple  (AAPL)  announced its fiscal third-quarter results on August 1, covering the period through June 29. The company reported earnings of $1.40 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $1.35. Revenue totaled $85.78 billion, a 4.9% year-over-year increase, exceeding expectations of $84.53 billion and setting a new third-quarter record. Apple's iPhone business remains a strong cornerstone of its revenue. The segment generated $39.30 billion in revenue in its latest quarter, down 1% from last year but exceeding the $38.81 billion forecast, accounting for about 46% of Apple's total sales. Apple claimed a 15.8% share of the market in the first quarter of 2024, while its long time competitor, Samsung, ranked first with a market share of 18.9%, according to Statista’s August report.

      "body":["(Reuters) -Qualcomm shares rose 4% on Thursday after the chip designer's strong quarterly revenue forecast fanned investor optimism about a China-led recovery in the smartphone market. The company, the biggest supplier of smartphone chips, will add around $8 billion to its market value, if the gains hold. It forecast both first-quarter sales and adjusted profit above market estimates on Wednesday, signaling the smartphone market was picking up after a tough 2023 as consumers upgrade devices for AI apps such as chatbots and image generators. Demand has been especially positive in major market China, from which Qualcomm gets nearly half its revenue, thanks to new smartphone launches by brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. \"This was a nice sign that the consumer was willing to spend on high-end cell phones,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. \"Improvement in the Chinese market played a big role. Can that continue is the big question for investors.\" Qualcomm is trying to diversify its revenue as it braces for the end of a lucrative tie-up with Apple, which is working on its own modem chips to replace those made by Qualcomm. While the deal to keep selling chips to Apple is until at least 2026, focus is on whether Qualcomm's efforts to break into laptops and artificial intelligence in data centers will ramp up quickly enough to offset declines in Apple revenue. \"Qualcomm is starting to enjoy additional revenue from the other markets it is focusing on including automotive, internet of things, headsets and PCs,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. President-elect Donald Trump has floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10% to 20% on virtually all imports as well as tariffs of 60% or more on goods from China, in a bid to boost U.S. manufacturing. \"Higher tariffs, if they are applied to chips from Taiwan, which I would be very surprised if they happen ... that would be an incentive for Qualcomm to move manufacturing stateside,\" said O'Donnell.

The stock has traded mostly sideways to higher on low trading volumes since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite's next move. Investors should monitor key lower price levels on Nvidia's chart around $144, $125 and $97, while watching an important higher level near $180.  Nvidia (NVDA) this week surged into the top position among the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization, surpassing iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). The AI chipmaker’s shares gained about 4% on Wednesday, hitting a record high of $146.49, as U.S. equities soared following the election of Donald Trump as president. Nvidia shares have risen nearly three-fold since the start of the year amid insatiable demand for the company’s family of AI chips, including its next generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). Below, we analyze the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors may be watching. Since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways to higher as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite’s next move. It’s worth pointing out that in recent months, the stock’s volume has tracked steadily lower, potentially indicating that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the US election and amid uncertainty over chip export curbs. Looking ahead, investors should monitor for increasing share turnover while eyeing these important price levels on Nvidia’s chart. The first lower level to watch sits at $144, an area on the chart just below Wednesday's closing price where the shares may encounter support near a period of consolidation positioned around the prior all-time high (ATH). Further selling could see Nvidia shares fall to around $125, an area on the chart where they currently find support near the closely watched 50-day moving average and symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline. A breakdown below this level could see the stock fall to the $97 region. Investors may seek entry points at this location near a trendline joining two March peaks with a series of prices positioned around the early-August low. To forecast a higher level using technical analysis, we can apply the measuring principle, often referred to as a measured move.    "],

      "body":["Buy the dip. That was the mindset around chip stocks last week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia (NVDA) to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries. Nvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. The stock was trading a touch higher, up 0.2%, in Monday's premarket trading. It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple (AAPL). But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. “There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts (video above). “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.” Even amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first. In the coming weeks, earnings from fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI. Last quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half. BofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia \"strengthening its position.\" Arya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 last week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price. Arya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.

      "body":["Rideshare concern Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) is seeing high options activity today, after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings and revenue and issued an upbeat current-quarter gross bookings outlook. The security attracted no fewer than 10 price-target hikes in response, including one from RBC to $24 from $10. So far today, 134,000 calls and 50,000 puts have been traded, which is seven times the volume typically seen at this point. Most active is the December 20 call, followed by the weekly 11/8 20-strike call, with new positions currently being opened at both contracts. This denotes a shift in sentiment, as puts were popular over the last couple weeks. The equity's 10-day put/call volume ratio of 1.21 over at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) ranks higher than all readings from the last 12 months. Short sellers are already hitting the exits, with short interest down 5.8% in the last two reporting periods. The 47.44 million shares sold short still make up 13% of the stock's available float, though. In other words, a further unwinding of pessimism could keepthe shares afloat. LYFT was last seen up 26.8% to trade at $18.26, and earlier surged to its highest level since April. Shares are pacing for their best day since February and fifth-straight daily gain. The equity also sports an 18.7% lead for 2024 and 66% year-over-year gain. "],

      "body":[" Apple shares are in the spotlight Monday following news that Berkshire Hathaway once again trimmed its stake in the tech giant. The stock traded within an ascending triangle between July and October before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline late last month. Investors should watch important support levels on Apple's chart around $218, $198, and $181, while monitoring key overhead areas near $233 and $270.  Apple (AAPL) shares are in the spotlight Monday following news over the weekend that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) has continued trimming its stake in the tech giant. Last week, Apple shares came under pressure after the company provided soft current-quarter revenue guidance, prompting concerns about a slow iPhone 16 upgrade cycle amid the delayed rollout of the company’s highly anticipated Apple Intelligence that it initially announced in June. The iPhone maker’s stock could also face scrutiny after Berkshire Hathaway reported on Saturday that it had offloaded about 100 million shares, or around 25% of its holding, in Apple during the third quarter. However, the tech behemoth remains the conglomerate’s largest stock position, with a market value of $69.9 billion as of Sept. 30. Apple shares were down 0.9% at around $221 in midday trading Monday. Below, we navigate Apple’s chart using technical analysis to identify important price levels worth watching out for. Apple shares traded within an ascending triangle between July and October before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline late last month following the company's quarterly results. Importantly, the recent move lower has occurred on increasing volume, indicating a rise in selling pressure among market participants. Let’s point out three important support levels on Apple’s chart and also identify key overhead areas to monitor if the stock resumes its longer-term uptrend. Firstly, it’s worth monitoring how the price responds to the $218 level, a location on the chart that may attract buying interest near the June peak, which also closely aligns with troughs in July and September. A decisive breakdown below this level could see the shares decline to around $198, where they may encounter support near a trendline joining a range of peaks on the chart between July and September last year with the 2024 August swing low. Further selling opens the door for a fall to lower support at the $181 level. Buy-and-hold investors may look for entry points around this area near a horizontal line linking a series of comparable trading levels on the chart from June last year to May this year.     "],
