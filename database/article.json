        "body": "China’s policymakers disappointed investors this week with a lack of follow-through on recent monetary policy stimulus measures. They get a second chance this weekend. China’s Ministry of Finance is set to hold a briefing on Saturday local time that’s expected to deliver up to 2 trillion yuan, or about $282 billion, in fiscal stimulus to an economy that continues to stagger under real-estate woes. My mother-in-law stole $25,000 from my husband’s emergency fund. We donated to charity rather than give her a birthday gift — and she cried foul. ‘It’s so unfair!’ I’m miserable in my job. I’m 58 and have $1 million in a 401(k) and Roth IRA. Can I afford to quit? ‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust? ‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off? ‘Their house was purchased with my family money’: My late father left a life estate to his second wife. She’s only 10 years older than me. How can I undo this? “Our economists highlight that the current market expectation is for a CNY1.5-2 trillion package (excluding CNY1 trillion in recapitalisation for big banks) and it will be important whether the actual announcement meets this threshold after a week of nervousness following a week or so of euphoria,” Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a Friday note. Euphoria indeed. Chinese stocks ripped higher at the end of September after the announcement of rate cuts and other measures by the People’s Bank of China aimed at breaking the economy out of its funk. But the rally stalled this week as investors returned from a holiday week looking for more support on the fiscal front. A briefing from the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s state economic planning body, on Tuesday failed to outline more stimulus measures, sending stocks into a skid. The China CSI 300 XX:000300 fell more than 3% this week, while the Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP dropped 3.6% the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI in Hong Kong dropped more than 6%. China-related ETFs saw sharp falls and were among the week’s biggest decliners. The Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF ASHR was off nearly 14% for the week, while the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB dropped nearly 10%. Deutsche Bank estimated that the total size of both fiscal and monetary stimulus could potentially reach CNY7.5 trillion, or 6% of GDP in 2024. That would make it the largest package in yuan terms and the third largest relative to GDP, Reid said. On the fiscal side, a CNY2 trillion yuan package would be comparable in size to what the government did in its 2020 pandemic response combined with other measures (see chart below).           ",

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump is again turning heads with his push to slash the federal corporate tax rate. The 2024 GOP presidential nominee proposes lowering it from 21% to 15%, which has stirred up much debate. Some see it as the key to supercharging the U.S. economy and stock market. Others, however, aren't so sure. Don't Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. Supporters of Trump’s plan point to past economic gains when taxes were lowered. According to the Tax Foundation, dropping the corporate tax rate to 15% could boost the U.S. GDP by 0.4% and add roughly 93,000 full-time jobs. This is music to the ears of those who believe that lower taxes will make the U.S. more attractive for business. A more competitive environment, they argue, could drive corporate growth, pump up earnings and ultimately benefit shareholders as stock prices climb. Trending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share Advocates also think this cut could push companies to funnel more money into share buybacks, further inflating stock prices. But the critics have their doubts. One big concern is the potential impact on federal revenues. As cited by CNN, Trump’s proposal could increase the national debt by between $1.5 trillion and $15.2 trillion. Even when factoring in economic growth, the revenue loss would still be a whopping $460 billion. As the U.S. grapples with a rising federal deficit – already expected to hit 202.6% of GDP by 2065 – some worry that these tax cuts might tie the government's hands when funding essential programs. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Another question in the air is whether corporate tax cuts reliably lead to stock market booms? Trump significantly boosted Corporate America by lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This legislation, along with a strong economy, led to record-breaking corporate earnings. Many executives decided to reward shareholders rather than investing in growth or hiring.             "

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. kick off the the quarterly earnings-report cycle on Friday, followed by Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Bank of America Corp. next week. Banks provide a good read on the state of both consumers and other companies, making their quarterly reports a crucial part of the earnings season. US bank stocks jumped almost 10% in the third quarter amid optimism around policymakers’ rate-cutting cycle and the resilient state of the economy, turning the latest update into a test of whether expectations ran too far. So far the going has been good for banks. Second quarter earnings were the second best among S&P 500 sub-industries with banks notably trouncing the S&P 500 Index as a whole, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. The focus is now on how net interest income, loan and deposit growth, credit quality, and consumer spending resilience will fare as US interest rates come down from a more than two-decade high. Bank stocks have been on a roll this year, with the KBW Bank Index rising almost 21%, roughly in line with the S&P 500 — no small feat considering the broader benchmark has seen its gains largely powered by tech giants like Nvidia and Apple. Still, the rally for banks has pushed them back around the peaks seen in late July. Analysts are split pretty evenly between buy and hold ratings. The split sets the tone for the earnings ahead; half expect the going to get better, while the other half have signaled caution. “Investors still seem optimistic about 2025 prospects, but with lingering near-term anxiety on net interest income,” said Piper Sandler’s analyst R. Scott Siefers. “In order words,” he wrote in a note, “while investors are optimistic about next year’s prospects, the path to get there could still be bumpy.” In September, JPMorgan President and Chief Operating Officer Daniel Pinto sent shares tumbling after warning investors that analysts are being too optimistic in projecting next year’s expenses and net interest income as rates start coming down. Pinto said that the net interest income estimate of $89.5 billion was “not very reasonable” given interest-rate expectations, and the figure “will be lower.”                "

        "body": "By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) - BlackRock's assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows, while the world's largest asset manager continued a push to expand its footprint in private markets. Assets managed by BlackRock shot to $11.48 trillion in the period, compared with $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter, the company said on Friday. That growth came as stocks reversed an August sell-off and broadened their rally in the third quarter, boosted by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. BlackRock is expanding its offerings to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. \"Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working,\" Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. The company's shares were recently up 3.6% on Friday. They have advanced about 18% in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21% jump in the S&P 500. Last week, the New York-based firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding over $100 billion in assets to its kitty. Later this year, it is expected to close its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin. The two deals are expected to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and in private markets, both key areas of growth. \"Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets in powering economic growth,\" Fink said in an earnings call on Friday. BlackRock registered $160 billion in long-term net inflows in the third quarter. Total net inflows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as interest rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. But with interest rates expected to fall as the Federal Reserve continues a long-anticipated easing cycle it kicked off in September, some of that money could flow into assets such as fixed income products, a development Fink said could occur in a more “normalized” but \"relatively high-rate environment.” Equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2%. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier.    ",

        "body": "Indexes slipped Thursday as investors priced in a higher-than-expected inflation reading. The data raises the possibility of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy. Traders still see the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points at next month's meeting. Stocks fell on Thursday from records reached in the previous session, as traders took in a sticky inflation reading for September. All three benchmark indexes fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down TK points, a 0.40% fall, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.% and 0.%, respectively. The declines follow rises across the board on Wednesday, which saw a fresh record close for both the S&P 500 and the Dow, and comes after inflation proved stickier than expected last month. September consumer price index data released on Thursday showed inflation rose 2.4% year-over-year, slightly above consensus forecasts of a 2.3% rise. The core CPI reading, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, was up 3.3% year-over-year and just above forecasts of 3.2%. The reading, coupled with last week's blockbuster jobs report, has sparked talk of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy, a scenario in which strong economic growth fuels inflation and makes it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut rates. A no landing would likely mean rate cuts are fewer or slower than markets had previously forecast. It would also mean borrowers are saddled with higher interest rates on their debt for longer. After the CPI release, investors adjusted their expectations for the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. The September jobs report had killed the odds of another big 50 basis point cut, but the slightly higher-than-expected CPI likely isn't enough to fully pump the brakes on Fed easing. \"Heading into the report, we thought only a very firm print would lead the Fed to consider pausing in November based on inflation alone. We did not get that,\" analysts from Bank of America said Thursday. \"While core PCE will be firmer than recent months, we think it will be enough for the Fed to follow through with a 25bp cut in November,\" they added. Investors are now pricing in higher odds of a 25 basis point rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims edged up 33,000 to 258,000, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That number marks its highest level in over a year and outpaced forecasts of 230,000. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the closing bell on Thursday: S&P 500: 5,780.05, down 0.21% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 42,454.12, down 0.14% (-57.88 points) Nasdaq composite: 18,282.05, down 0.05%           "

        "body": "Donald Trump’s campaign team is examining steps to sideline Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, should the former president return to the White House. Speaking with Barron’s, Trump economic advisor Scott Bessent suggested Congress approve a Fed chair designate more than a year before the central bank governor’s term expires in May 2026. This would effectively install a babysitter alongside the current Fed chair, and it could render Powell a lame duck for the remainder of his time in office. Bessent, founder of the hedge fund Key Square Group, is reportedly on the short list for Treasury secretary in a second Trump administration, according to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal. “You could do the earliest Fed nomination and create a shadow Fed chair,” Bessent told Barron’s. “And based on the concept of forward guidance, no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore.” During Trump’s latter half in office, his relationship with the Fed chair, whom the president himself had appointed, became increasingly acrimonious. Powell repeatedly ignored White House pressure to help the president’s reelection chances by juicing the economy through lower interest rates. Taking to Twitter to launch a tirade against Powell became a regular occurrence. Once Trump even asked whether the Fed chair was a bigger enemy to the American people than China’s Xi Jinping. Bessent said he has circulated the plan to sideline Powell among fellow Trump campaign advisors, where it was well received. Nonetheless, this is not official policy, at least not yet. “This is my idea,” the hedge fund manager added, “not the president’s.” Citing his purported business acumen, Trump has openly expressed a desire to erode the U.S. central bank’s prized independence. This has sparked comparisons to Richard Nixon, whose Fed chair was widely considered the worst in the institution’s recent history. Ed Yardeni, a Wall Street veteran and president of Yardeni Research, told the publication it was a “terrible” idea. A shadow Fed chair would “create a lot of noise in the market,” leaving investors guessing as to whose words weighed more heavily within the FOMC, the Fed’s main policy-setting committee. “Everybody would be looking at the calendar to see when Powell is out,” Yardeni told Barron’s. The independence of the Fed from the political vagaries on Pennsylvania Avenue and Capitol Hill is considered sacrosanct—a crucial prerequisite for a responsible monetary policy that places price stability at its core.

The ministry didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. While major Western merchants stopped originating grain for export in Russia after facing government pressure in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, the traders can still buy cargoes of Russian grain from other firms. Those transactions still typically occur at large volumes. The Russian grain industry has grown increasingly consolidated after Western merchants pulled back and as the country’s top private trader faced a spat with the state. That put the market in the hands of fewer companies, some of which have or had links to the Kremlin. Top Supplier Russia is the world’s biggest wheat exporter and any disruptions to its export flows would boost costs of the staple grain for buyers from Africa to Asia. Wheat also remains a major source of export revenue and political influence for the nation in the midst of its invasion of Ukraine, as food isn’t directly sanctioned. The union said that exporters had agreed not to provide Russian grain to foreign winners of tenders, during a meeting on the sidelines of the Golden Autumn exhibition in Moscow this week. It also criticized new exporters for “dumping” of grain and said that such practices must be eradicated. While wheat supplies in the country remain large, farmers reaped a smaller harvest this year amid frost and dry weather, breaking a streak of bumper production. Russia normally limits exports in the latter part of the season from February to June, with allowances allocated based on the volume traders exported in the first half. Quotas have not been restrictive in recent seasons. Still, Moscow’s exports at the start of the season have matched last year’s record volumes, which was expected to restrain shipments later on.        "

Chairman of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee, Alexey Kalitsev said in a statement: “As the committee expected, sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles kept on growing in September. As forecasted, this is largely due to the expectation of price increases amid changes in disposal fee rates and an increase in the key [interest] rate. “A record August was followed by a very successful September, which results significantly exceeded last year's figures. “However, despite the success, overall sales in the third quarter did not go beyond the sales volume in the second quarter of this year. This may indicate that we are approaching a limitation of the market's growth potential due to a decrease in purchasing power and the satisfaction of deferred demand from consumers. Most likely, the positive dynamics will continue in the coming months, butwill not be as rapid. “The results of 9 months demonstrate that, with a high degree of probability, by the end of 2024 the market will achieve higher figures than the committee forecasted earlier. “To ensure further market development, government support for demand and local production will be required.\" As European countries exited Russia following Russia’s military operations in Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent imposition of economic sanctions, Chinese OEMs have effectively replaced them in the Russian market and also started local assembly/manufacturing operations. Soaring trailer demand Gary Beecroft, an analyst with UK consultants CLEAR, also estimates that trailer demand has soared in Russia over the past two years. \"Russia's economy has shifted toward buying higher quantities of transport assets,\" he says. \"This has included heavy goods trailers. We estimate that overall trailer sales in Russia this year will be approaching 36,000, which compares with 24,000 in 2021, a more normal volume year for the industry. \"And again, the Chinese are filling the gaps left by Western manufacturers who previously exported to Russia - for both trucks and trailers.\"      "

        "body": "AI enthusiasm has rebounded in recent weeks after investors worried about returns over the summer. In the next wave of investment, Goldman Sachs analysts recommend \"platform\" stocks like Microsoft and Datadog. Analysts recommend stocks that will build a direct application of AI and allow for more widespread adoption. Move over, Nvidia. With artificial intelligence investment rebounding after excitement cooled over the summer, a new set of stocks is set to benefit from the next wave of cash flowing to the burgeoning sector, according to Goldman Sachs. In the next round of AI investment, Goldman Sachs analysts say investors should look past the obvious picks—Nvidia and AI infrastructure companies—and toward a select set of platforms set to build out a direct application of AI. \"Our equity analysts believe 'platform' stocks, including databases and development tools, are set to be the primary beneficiaries of the next wave of generative AI investments. These platforms allow the best use of AI infrastructure while providing building blocks to construct next generation applications,\" the analysts said in a Thursday note. The analysts name Microsoft, DataDog, MongoDB, Elastic, and Snowflake as the best-positioned platform stocks as they roll out AI-integrated applications. While many of those platform stocks have plunged this year on near-term fundamental weakness, they have historically low valuations and stabilizing revisions that set them up well as AI investment rebounds, the analysts say. The analysts' recommendations come as investors remain focused on Nvidia and the companies that build out AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors, cloud providers, and data center REITs. The analysts say the share prices for those stocks will likely continue to increase, but returns will be driven more by earnings than valuations. \"Expected future returns could be constrained by elevated starting valuations, although valuations are historically a poor near-term signal for large-cap equities,\" the analysts said, adding that with AI spend surprising less to the upside than before, that could make for more moderate returns for those \"phase 2\" AI infrastructure stocks. In general, the platform stocks are the exception among other \"phase 3\" stocks—those with potential to monetize AI by generating incremental revenues like in software and IT services— because the timing of AI monetization is still uncertain. The same goes for \"phase 4\" stocks, or companies that would benefit from widespread adoption in general since that's likely still years away, the analysts said.     "

But now the nation’s chippies may want to reconsider: they could be sitting on supplies of liquid gold. For the first time, a major stock exchange is set to launch a market for supplies of waste cooking oils as production of eco-fuels becomes big business. Bursa Malaysia, Malaysia’s biggest stock market and the main hub for trading palm oil globally, is considering the launch of futures contracts for used cooking oil, according to Bloomberg. Cooking oil and similar waste are common by-products of restaurants and food manufacturers that use deep fat fryers. A typical tabletop fryer holds about 10 litres of oil and this needs to be changed at least once or twice a week, according to Bio UK Fuels, a Sheffield-based company that recycles the waste. This used oil can be used as a feedstock to produce so-called biofuels, which produce fewer carbon emissions compared to traditional petrol and diesel products. These are increasingly being used to fuel vehicles, provide heating and generate electricity, with the European Union adopting rules last year to mandate uptake. Waste oil biofuels consumption rose globally by almost 40pc between 2021 and 2023, according to an estimate from the Transport & Environment lobby group. Bursa Malaysia plans to offer US dollar-denominated contracts for lots of 25 metric tons of used cooking oil, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. A spokesperson for Bursa Malaysia said changes may still be made, with any contract launch subject to regulatory approval. Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

But on Wall Street things are eerily quiet, as the so-called smart money is reluctant to wager on what’s about to happen. Most Read from Bloomberg San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? “Never bet on the flip of a coin,” said George Ball, head of the Houston-based investment firm Sanders Morris Harris. “The election is too close to permit thoughtful investment positioning.” Hedge funds aren’t reducing their stock positions the way they historically do ahead of elections, and instead have elevated exposure to equities as the S&P 500 Index continues to set records, according to Goldman Sachs prime brokerage data going back to 2008. Meanwhile, options traders are more focused on the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cuts and the health of the US economy, putting the Nov. 5 vote lower on the list of immediate priorities, market veterans say. “Concerns about the elections are around fifth in line behind the war in the Middle East, the explosive moves in China, the push-and-pull of US economic data and shifting Fed easing expectations, upcoming earnings season, etcetera,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. The most recent election polling averages from Real Clear Politics show Democrat Kamala Harris with 49.2% support nationally, and Republican Donald Trump at 47.2%. But with the Electoral College, national averages are far less important than state-by-state polls, which essentially show a neck-and-neck race. And the chance of either party sweeping the presidency and both houses of Congress is considered low. Wait-And-See “First, it’s a very close presidential race, especially in the swing states,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. “Second, both candidates have very ambitious economic goals, and I highly doubt either will be able to fully implement these campaign promises unless their party takes the White House, the Senate, and the House.” Hedge funds are taking a wait-and-see approach to the election, waiting until there’s more clarity before making significant politically connected investment bets, said Jonathan Caplis, chief executive officer of hedge fund research firm PivotalPath. The approach has worked so far this year, as US long-short hedge funds have posted an 11% gain through September, which is in the top quartile of rolling nine-month returns since 2010, according to PivotalPath.

        "body": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock fell 1.7% Thursday after rallying as much as 9% the day before continuing its roller coaster ride of a week as investors swing between optimism over the company’s strong financials and cautiousness over its regulatory risks. Super Micro is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegations of shady business practices outlined in a scathing report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research in late August. That has pressured the stock, which has hovered under $50 per share since then. This week, SMCI climbed on positive reports from the AI server maker. Super Micro surged 16% Monday after the company released numbers showing strong demand for its products. The stock was up 12% on Thursday from the prior week. Super Micro makes servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips for data centers that power artificial intelligence software. The company said it’s shipping servers containing over 100,000 Nvidia GPUs per quarter “for some of the largest AI factories ever built.” Then on Tuesday, shares of SMCI fell 5% after a promising premarket rally that saw the stock jump as much as 7%. Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, said investors’ euphoria over the company’s shipment data faded against the backdrop of Super Micro’s regulatory risk. “I think one piece of good news hardly undoes multiple months of significant financial and regulatory scrutiny around a company like this,” Newman said. The Hindenburg report in August accused Super Micro of shoddy accounting, undisclosed relationships between its CEO and companies it does business with, and violations of US export bans. For example, Hindenburg said Super Micro has shipped servers to sanctioned Russian firms through shell companies, some of which were likely used by its military for its war against Ukraine. The day after Hindenburg released its report, Super Micro shares dropped 20%. The company also delayed filing its annual 10-K report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Super Micro’s woes continued with a Wall Street Journal report of an alleged DOJ probe, which sent shares tumbling in late September. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said the Hindenburg report contained “false or inaccurate statements” and “misleading presentations of information that we have previously shared publicly.” Liang said the company’s delayed 10-K filing would not affect the company’s fourth quarter financial results, adding that Super Micro would address Hindenburg’s allegations “in due course.” Super Micro’s stock climb this week displays the tension between its potential as a key player in the AI boom and its regulatory hurdles.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Celsius’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Celsius and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago when the stock gained 14% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results that blew past analysts' revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations. Notably, topline growth was strong as revenue grew 95% year on year, driven mostly by North American revenue (up 97% year on year). Management noted that the North American business was led by expansion in distribution points and higher SKUs per location. International revenue also came in strong. This was driven by new flavor launches, product availability, and increased velocity. As a result, the gross margin improved significantly (up 110% y/y) and contributed significantly to the EBITDA beat. On the other hand, its EPS narrowly missed analysts' expectations. Zooming out, this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track. Celsius is down 41.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $34.40 per share, it is trading 64.2% below its 52-week high of $96.11 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Celsius’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $32,048.

The stock barometer has gained 21.2% already in 2024, registering 44 record closes along the way. Inevitably, those of a bearish bent have been getting more anxious as the S&P 500 ascends into the rarefied air near 6,000. At such peaks dizzy climbers are more prone to silly mistakes, they warn. My mother-in-law stole $25,000 from my husband’s emergency fund. We donated to charity rather than give her a birthday gift — and she cried foul. ‘It’s so unfair!’ I’m miserable in my job. I’m 58 and have $1 million in a 401(k) and Roth IRA. Can I afford to quit? ‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust? ‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off? ‘Their house was purchased with my family money’: My late father left a life estate to his second wife. She’s only 10 years older than me. How can I undo this? Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, is having none of that. Carson turned bullish in Nov. 2022, dismissing those who warned that stocks would continue to struggle as recession loomed for the U.S. In fact, Detrick notes, the economy appears to be warming up, not slowing down, and importantly the bull market is actually quite young. “That’s right, a two-year bull market historically has plenty of life left, with the average bull market since 1950 lasting more than five years and gaining more than 180%,” he says. Detrick reminds us that the market Cassandras have been consistently vocal during this current rally. He recalls that a year ago there were many observers saying that a relatively weak first year of a bull market — stocks were up about 20% — meant the recovery could not be sustained. “We noted this was probably the wrong way to look at it and suggested being open to the possibility of huge gains in year two. Well, after more than 30% gains during the second year of the bull market we would say that indeed was the way to look at things,” Detrick says. Of course, the crucial question for investors is whether they’ll be celebrating the bull’s third birthday. Detrick thinks they will, though history suggests traders should not expect such big gains. “We found that out of 16 previous bull markets (after bear or near bear markets), 12 of them made it to their third birthday, with an average gain of about 8% and a median return of nearly 10% in year three, pretty much what your average year does,” says Detrick.

Things were decidedly not normal, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. Of course, all of this affected the fashion industry from the brands and retailers to the textile manufacturers, the mills and farmers that produce natural fibers like cotton. Subsequent sourcing interruptions, inflation and concerns about recession were some of the pandemic’s lasting effects. But now, experts say it seems we’re “coming back to normal.” More from Sourcing Journal These Were the Men's Cotton and Denim Looks Coming Out of Fashion Week How Accessibility and Awareness Can Catapult Circular Change The Surprising Ways Gen Z is Shopping Now And that’s good news as the industry recently acknowledged the third official United Nations World Cotton Day on Oct. 7. The day is meant to acknowledge that “cotton is more than just a commodity. This natural fabric is a life-changing product worldwide that sustains 32 million growers (almost half of them women) and benefits over 100 million families across 80 countries in five continents.” In his last Monthly Economic Letter, Cotton Incorporated’s Jon Devine, senior economist in the corporate strategy and program metrics division, states that after several months of decline, cotton prices stabilized in August. “Things have been tougher for U.S. growers because prices are down,” Devine told the Lifestyle Monitor™ in an interview. “But for manufacturers, they should gradually see things come back to normal. The orders were overbooked up to the first half of 2022, but it’s been really quiet since then because inflation and higher interest rates raised concerns about recession. As we move beyond those fears, we should see a return to more predictable business conditions. This should be a relief because the volume on orders has been switching back and forth between zero and 10 in recent years. If orders can settle back at a comfortable six or seven and be less herky-jerky, it will bring more clarity and more ability to plan.” And retailers should be planning for a solid fourth quarter, according to the National Retail Federation’s Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist. “The momentum of the economy during the third quarter looks decent even though the labor market is showing some weakness,” Kleinhenz told the Monitor™ in an interview. “Consumers have remained resilient and have been driving the economy. Spending for the first eight months of the year is very much in line with NRF’s 2024 forecast of retail sales growth between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent, which is great, although a bit of a slower pace than last year. The holiday shopping season is just around the corner, and we believe consumers will remain engaged for the holiday season.”                           "

This is part of efforts to prepare for its next growth phase, which includes achieving an annual recurring revenue of $5 billion. Desai is a high-profile tech executive who has a track record for driving innovation at scale. Most recently, he served as President and Chief Operating Officer at ServiceNow (NOW) and helped scale the company from $1.5 billion to more than $10 billion in annualized revenue. During his time at ServiceNow, he oversaw products, platform, design, engineering, customer support, cloud infrastructure operations, and customer success. Many have pointed out that he's been quoted almost as often as the CEO, especially with regards to product details and updates. Before assuming the ServiceNow COO role, Desai was Chief Product Officer. In a blog post, he wrote about joining Cloudflare. \"The world is in a very interesting moment for technological innovation: the AI landscape is uncharted and developing at an exponential rate; the urgency for enterprises to reduce tech debt and reliance on legacy applications is at an all time high; multi-cloud deployments are becoming a reality for optimal performance and global scale; and high performance connectivity is table stakes. Cloudflare finds itself in a compelling position at the intersection of these key themes.\" Is now the time to buy Cloudflare? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Cloudflare’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock gained 5.2% as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent). The Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years. The Fed—under Chair Jerome Powell—began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot. Looking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25.     ",

JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock shares climbed after beating earnings estimates. US stocks edged higher on Friday after Producer Price Index data for September came in lower than expected, signaling a continued cooling of wholesale inflation. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, Core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. TradeStation strategist David Russell told Business Insider the data supports another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. \"CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not. Overall, these numbers are getting less impactful as inflation moderates. The Fed could still be on track for 25 basis points at the next two meetings. Yields have surged lately, but it's not clear they have much more reason for continued upside,\" Russell said. Investors are also digesting earnings results from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock. All three stocks moved higher after the results, which beat analyst estimates on most fronts. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release, but warned that geopolitical conditions are \"treacherous and getting worse.\" Apart from earnings results, retail sales data, set to be released on October 17, is the next big data release for investors to watch.

In year-on-year (YoY) terms, sales volumes were down 4.8% — September 2023 being a relatively strong base for comparison as improved supply supported the fulfilment of backlogged orders. Sales in Germany remained disappointing as consumer confidence struggles. In what is a seasonally strong month for the UK, the selling rate fell back from recent levels, though YoY growth was in positive territory. Year-to-date (YTD), the Western European market is now flat in comparison to last year (+0.3%). The big picture within the industry remains the same. Strong vehicle pricing, high interest rates, and a lack of incentives, continue to restrict sales. Some improvement is expected moving in 2025 as monetary policy easing supports broad economic expansion. Commentary The PV selling rate for Western Europe fell to 11.3 mn units/year in September. Our outlook for the full year remains subdued, and these incoming figures cement our expectation that the market will not pass 2023’s result. We continue to assume improved market activity in 2025 as the economy picks up, and a more favourable vehicle pricing evolution for consumers. Geopolitical issues, as well as political and economic uncertainty, provide downside risk. The German PV market registered 209k units in September, a 7% decline YoY. The selling rate fell further by 6% MoM to 2.54 million units. Year-to-date sales are now 2.1 million units. Weaker consumer confidence, a staggering economy and a lack of incentives currently continue to have negative effects on the automotive market. Italy’s PV market fell again in September as new car registrations were down 10.7% YoY to 122k units. The selling rate fell by 11% MoM to 1.55 million units. The broader economic challenges in Italy, coupled with difficulties in production, further contributed to the downturn in car sales. The French PV market declined 11.1% YoY to 139k units. The selling rate remained broadly flat at 1.74 million units/year. This is the fifth consecutive month that PV sales have fallen in France in comparison to last year. A lack of subsidies and political uncertainty, especially regarding the fiscal deficit, continue to dampen consumer confidence. The UK PV market registered 275k units September, a 1% increase YoY. The new number plate number month of September is traditionally a bumper month along with March. This was the best performance since 2020; however, was still nearly 20% lower than pre-Covid September 2019. Private consumer demand fell, while fleet purchases continued growth seen in previous months. YTD sales have reached 1.51 million units, a 4.3% increase YoY. Private BEV demand remains down YTD and highlights concerns regarding the future mandated targets. The Spanish PV market registered 73k units in September, a 6.3% increase YoY. Additionally, the selling rate increased by 23% MoM to 1.17 million units/year. Year-to-date sales are now 745k units, a 4.7% increase YoY. The increase in registrations this month saw car rental companies as the main driver of this growth. Despite this, the private channel has performed well.      ",

        "authors": [

        ],

        "body": "SoFi Technologies (SOFI) has positioned itself as one of the most exciting fintech companies, offering a wide range of services and products that many traditional banks struggle to match. While the stock has declined by about 10% this year, I believe this decline is largely due to investors’ short-term preoccupation with challenges, particularly the high-interest rate environment that is now beginning to change. In this article, I will outline five key reasons that support my bullish view of SOFI stock, especially at current levels. The first tenet of my SoFi investment thesis is its impressive top-line growth. In its most recent Q2 results, reported on July 30, SoFi delivered a strong 22% year-over-year increase in adjusted net revenue, reaching a record $597 million. Furthermore, its financial services and technology platform revenue grew by 46% year-over-year and now comprises 45% of total adjusted net revenue, up from just 38% a year ago. This diversification away from lending and toward financial services and technology platforms boosts SoFi’s growth potential and reduces its reliance on a single revenue stream, making the company more resilient. Additionally, SoFi has carved out a niche in financial services by targeting a high-income, young demographic often underserved by traditional banks. While most large banks offer limited specialized services, SoFi provides a comprehensive range of offerings, from student loans to estate planning, allowing it to cater to the specific needs of this demographic. In addition to strong top-line growth, SoFi has been making significant strides in profitability. The fintech has posted three consecutive quarters of profitability, with $17 million of GAAP net income for the 3 months ending in June 2024, compared to a $40 million loss in the year prior. This meaningful improvement drives investor confidence and demonstrates that SoFi’s business model is sustainable and capable of scaling profitably over time. Moreover, SoFi’s focus on product development, along with its commitment to operational efficiency, is poised to drive long-term growth and profitability. Wall Street shares this optimism, projecting robust earnings growth over the next 3 years from $0.11 EPS for 2024 to $0.64 of EPS in 2027. This underscores the company’s strong future prospects. The company’s current valuation is also attractive relative to growth expectations. Currently, SoFi trades at a seemingly stretched forward P/E ratio of 78x. However, if SoFi does reach EPS of $0.64 by 2027, that multiple drops to 13.4x. That valuation is much closer to those of traditional banks, which typically trade at earnings multiples between 11x and 13x. That said, since SoFi’s business is far from mature, and earnings are just getting started, the current P/E ratio premium makes sense. My fourth bullish point is in regards SoFi’s rapid growth of its member base. In the second quarter of 2024, the company added 643,000 new members, representing a 41% year-over-year increase, bringing the total to 8.77 million members. SoFi’s digital-first approach also eliminates the need for brick-and-mortar locations and helps reduce costs while meeting consumer demand for convenient, tech-driven financial services. This strategy positions SoFi well to capitalize on the continued shift toward online banking and fintech innovation. The fifth argument underlying my bullish view of SoFi is potential macroeconomic relief. Management has been concerned over the past few quarters that higher interest rates could dampen economic activity, leading to job losses and missed loan payments. Consequently, management aimed to reduce lending, initially forecasting a decline in revenue of at least 5% for 2024. However, as the Fed cut interest rates by half a percentage point a few weeks ago, management’s outlook will likely improve. SoFi may have weathered the worst of the rising interest rate cycle. Lower interest rates typically improve economic activity, reducing the risk of loan losses. Despite diversification efforts, SoFi’s balance sheet remains heavily concentrated in lending, with a loan-to-asset ratio of approximately 77.4%. Management’s caution was justified, as an increase in defaults could seriously threaten results. Notably, the 90-day personal loan delinquency rate fell to 64 basis points in the most recent quarter, down from 72 basis points in Q1, indicating a potential peak in delinquencies. Despite the bullish arguments presented in this article, Wall Street remains cautious on SOFI stock. Of the 14 analysts covering the stock, only five recommend a Buy, six rate it as a Hold, and three suggest a Sell, resulting in an overall Hold consensus according to TipRanks. The average SOFI stock price target is $8.27, almost 5% lower than the recent market price. In summary, despite short-term challenges and cautious analyst sentiment, SoFi’s strong revenue growth, improving profitability, and strategic diversification make a compelling case for growth at a reasonable valuation for long-term investors. With a rapidly expanding member base and a digital-first strategy, I believe the company is well-positioned to thrive in the evolving fintech landscape. This warrants a bullish sentiment for SOFI stock at current prices. Disclosure Disclaimer ",

China's finance minister has called a fiscal policy briefing for Saturday against a backdrop of high expectations and jittery trade. Investors and, as of Thursday, Swedish furniture shop IKEA want fiscal stimulus to reinvigorate the economy. Markets are expecting Beijing to announce 2 trillion to 3 trillion yuan ($280-$420 billion) in new spending, and worries about whether it will deliver - after a similar disappointment from policymakers' briefing early this week - had Chinese equities falling on Friday. On the geopolitical front, Israel is mulling its response to an Iranian missile attack, and a retaliatory strike on oil or military targets would likely draw a sharp reaction in financial markets. Investors in Asia were taking chips off the table. Chinese stocks are set for a weekly drop as follow-up details on promises to support the economy have so far underwhelmed. Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday on Friday, leaving the Hang Seng nursing its largest weekly drop in two years as investors hit pause on one of its sharpest ever rallies. Gold was creeping higher. British monthly GDP data is due in the European session and, while it is hard to really gauge growth from monthly figures, signs of strength in the services sector may have investors dialling back expectations for interest rate cuts. Markets price about a 3/4 chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in November, while opinions at the Bank of England itself are also divided. Rate cuts should come gradually, BoE chief economist Huw Pill told the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last week, a day after Governor Andrew Bailey was quoted in the Guardian saying the central bank could move aggressively. Among U.S. earnings, J.P. Morgan, BNY and Wells Fargo are due before the open. Tesla shares may react to the long-awaited showcase of an autonomous taxi in Los Angeles, which came with fanfare but few details on timing. Production is not set to begin until 2026. U.S. producer prices data is also due and will frame expectations for the Federal Reserve's preferred PCE measure out later in the month. Slightly stronger-than-expected inflation in September has, for now, knocked out market expectations of anything more than a 25 bp interest rate cut at the Fed's November meeting.

Recommended Reading Weis Markets buys 2 supermarkets LAS VEGAS — Weis Markets was initially skeptical when Amazon came to it with a plan to fulfill delivery orders for the chain. But the grocer’s decision to accept the proposal has turned out to benefit the East Coast supermarket chain on several fronts, the company’s chief information officer said. The relationship with Amazon has helped Weis improve its in-store operations, gain more insight into its e-commerce business and reach shoppers in areas beyond the reach of its brick-and-mortar stores, Greg Zeh, senior vice president and CIO of Weis Markets, said during a Monday panel session at Groceryshop. “When Amazon approached us about becoming a grocery partner, they kind of gave us an idea [of] what they thought that sales volume might be, and we kind of looked at them … sideways and said, ‘We’re not sure if that makes sense or not,’” Zeh said. Weis is currently working with Amazon to service orders from 23 sites that represent 75% of the grocer’s footprint. Amazon can handle deliveries to customers living within a 52-minute radius of Weis’ stores, Zeh said. Weis has been able to tap Amazon’s e-commerce expertise to bring “some very good discipline to the organization” and help Weis’ team sharpen its ability to manage online orders, Zeh said. In an example of that, Weis workers have used metrics provided by Amazon to become more adept at picking products ordered by online shoppers, Zeh said. Weis is currently working with Amazon to service orders from 23 sites that represent 75% of the grocer’s footprint. Amazon can handle deliveries to customers living within a 52-minute radius of Weis’ stores, Zeh said. Zeh noted that third-party delivery providers account for about two-thirds of its e-commerce sales volume, with Amazon handling about a quarter of that business. Weis also works with e-commerce companies including Instacart, DoorDash, Uber Eats and Shipt. Weis, which is based in Pennsylvania and runs about 200 stores in seven states, has also been able to add shoppers in markets that were beyond its reach before it joined forces with Amazon, giving it an opportunity to add customers in more metropolitan areas to its footprint, Zeh said. That could help Weis build its e-commerce volume to the point that it might consider investing in micro-fulfillment equipment, he added.    ",

After a hot jobs report and a consumer inflation reading that didn’t put to bed concerns about rising prices, there’s more confusion than usual about what the Federal Reserve will do next with rates. Hopes for China stimulus and its ripple effect have sprung up, but the picture there remains murky as well, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in Chinese stocks. Throw in a couple of literal hurricanes and a figurative one in the Mideast, and investors have a lot to weigh when making decisions. Oh, and one more thing — the presidential election. Election years tend to be tough on October stock returns. “An upcoming US Election, a surprise stimulus from China and a broadening Middle East conflict will continue to exaggerate the Macro, and its very uncertain uncertainties, over Micro this Earnings season,” Evercore ISI’s Julian Emanuel wrote in a recent note to clients.

Indeed, as earnings reports start to roll out, first from the banks today and then broadening out next week, Bank of America thinks investors will be looking past the current noise. “I think this earnings season is going to be pretty tricky,” Ohsung Kwon, US and Canada equity strategist at Bank of America, said in a recent interview. “I don't think the big focus is on Q3. Everyone basically knows that Q3 wasn't a very strong macro environment … So I don't think the bar is that high, but also the focus isn't really about Q3. It's really about companies' outlook on the other side of the curve. Now that the easing cycle has started, what are companies going to say about any early indications of improvement given the lower rate environment?” All of that said, stocks could still benefit from estimate-beating numbers and raised forecasts, Kwon wrote in a note to investors. He expects earnings for the S&P 500 to have risen 4% year over year in the third quarter, a sharp slowdown from the 11% gain in the second. (Evercore puts the predicted gain at 6.5%). Wherever the various strategists’ forecasts land, “As long as companies have managed through macro headwinds and see early signs of improvement from lower rates, stocks should get rewarded,” Kwon wrote.

This year, Oct. 14 is the second Monday of October, the date that Columbus Day is celebrated in the U.S., meaning you may be wondering if stock markets will be open for trading. Considering the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq largely follow the calendar of federal holidays for closures, it may come as a surprise that both will be open and operating normally on Monday.

This product aligns with the company's strategy to generate recurring revenue and is expected to be compatible with various life-support machines, potentially addressing the $1bn perfusion systems market. The disposable kit is a single-use product that alerts medical teams to any changes in performance during operation and treatment. Its unique design is intended to offer a smart, adaptable experience for users. Inspira Technologies co-founder and CEO Dagi Ben-Noon said: “This new innovation and capability, being integrated into our disposable kit, is expected to be an additional step by Inspira to provide new technologies and user experiences for the purpose of supporting improved safety and patient care.” Inspira is preparing to submit an application for US FDA clearance to market the disposable kit. Upon approval, the kit will be available for hospitals using the INSPIRA ART100 system. The ART100 system received FDA 510(k) clearance for cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in May this year. The company expects the first devices to be deployed in the US by the end of 2024. Inspira received approval from the Israeli Ministry of Health for its INSPIRA ART100 system in July this year. The company has developed INSPIRA ART with the aim of transforming the $19bn mechanical ventilation market. INSPIRA ART features the clip-on HYLA blood sensor, a real-time continuous monitoring technology that alerts physicians to patient condition changes without needing blood samples, helping them make informed decisions. \"Inspira develops new disposable kit for perfusion market\" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.

That pushed its total gain since inception seven years ago to 825%, according to data compiled by Shenzhen PaiPaiWang Investment & Management Co., which tracks Chinese hedge funds. Chinese tech stocks have soared since the government announced an economic stimulus package, fueling gains at long-only hedge funds like Huaan Hexin that have placed heavy bets on a sector once favored by short sellers. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks 30 Chinese tech firms traded in Hong Kong, surged more than 50% since mid-September before paring gains this week. “The market is just rebounding from an extremely bearish level to a level that’s still undervalued,” Yuan said. While further upside partly depends on the effects of the stimulus measures on the economy, internet firms have seen turning points in profitability since last year, he said. The boost from an improving industry environment can offset any pressure on earnings from the economic slowdown, rendering firms like Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan “safe havens,” he added. “Their profit elasticity by far exceeds the impact from macroeconomic volatilities,” Yuan said. “And if the economy improves, they benefit as well.” Yuan said his positions are primarily in Hong Kong-traded stocks and mostly held since last year, without providing details. The company has recently started buying shares of a Chinese manufacturing firm due to its growth prospects and low valuations, he said, declining to name the target.          "

        "body": "Hurricane Milton struck Florida's central west coast as a dangerous Category 3 storm on Oct. 9. As Floridians braced for the hurricane's landfall, airlines canceled hundreds of flights and cruise lines shifted routes. At least 16 cruise ships are directly affected, and some cruises advised that they did not expect to be able to return to port until Oct. 12, Florida's Maritime Executive newspaper reported. The Florida cruise industry is just entering its busy season, which generally aligns with winter as travelers from colder regions, especially the northern U.S. and Canada, flock south to warmer weather and the Caribbean. Despite the disruptions, analysts remain optimistic about the cruise industry’s resilience, lifting stock price targets for the major cruise lines. Cruise lines were particularly vulnerable when operations were halted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, analysts are seeing growth driven by strong demand from U.S. customers, who continue to travel despite economic uncertainties. Image source: Dan Kline/Come Cruise With Me Citigroup on Oct. 9 updated share-price targets on Carnival  (CCL) , Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The analyst is optimistic that the cruise-sector rally will extend into 2025 and beyond, thefly.com reported. All three stocks are up more than 20% in the past month. Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian Cruise Line are the biggest market players in the cruise line industry. According to Cruise Market Watch, in 2024 Carnival and its sub-brands accounted for 37.3% of the industry’s revenue, with Royal Caribbean Group at 23.9% and Norwegian at 14.1%. Citi raised its price target on Carnival to $28 from $25 and affirmed a buy rating on the shares. Related: Analysts retool Carnival stock price targets ahead of earnings The analyst said Carnival has strong potential for revenue growth, citing recent positive trends in the company’s performance and the anticipated benefits from assets like Celebration Key, the line’s new private island destination in the Bahamas. Celebration Key is set to open in July. On Sept. 30, Carnival reported that for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31, net income surged 60% from a year earlier to $1.7 billion as revenue increased 14% to $7.9 billion. Citi also says Carnival could sacrifice sales growth and focus on reducing debt and interest payments. Although Carnival has posted impressive financial results, it remains burdened by substantial debt. Carnival’s debt reached its peak at $35.14 billion in Q1 2023. As of Aug. 31, it still has nearly $29 billion in total debt. But if interest rates ease, Carnival could benefit from reduced debt repayments, particularly when it refinances or issues new debt.                  ",

Of the top ten brands, Jeep demonstrated the standout growth in BEV retail sales with a staggering 420% increase in new registrations, albeit from a low baseline in 2023. Close behind was BMW, with a 402% increase, establishing itself as a premium competitor to Tesla. Conversely, MG faced significant challenges, seeing the largest market decline at 46%. Tesla, despite retaining its position as the third best-selling brand, experienced a 40% year-on-year drop, falling behind Peugeot and Renault in their home market. However, 2024 has been less favourable for the Model Y, with new registrations down by 34% as of August, leading to a decline in market share to 8%. Despite these challenges, it remains the second most popular BEV model in France, just behind the Peugeot 208. To counter this trend, Tesla launched short-term finance offers for September 2024, including easy lease and classic credit options, to stimulate demand and clear inventory before the anticipated arrival of a refreshed Model Y in the first half of 2025. This strategic move also aimed to clear inventory build-up of the current Model Y versions in September, with a view to closing the order books for the third quarter of 2024 on a strong note. It also reflected anticipation of the arrival of the restyled Model Y next year. Tesla’s headline LOA (easy lease) offer, which gave the customer a purchase option if they wished to own the vehicle, started at a monthly payment rate of €299 per month with an OEM discount, or ‘Tesla bonus’, of €4,000. This discount was on top of the €4,000 ecological bonus available from the government for qualifying versions.

        "body": " Most exchange-traded fund investors say that economic and political events such as high inflation and the election have had no effect on how they invest in ETFs, according to a new report by Charles Schwab Asset Management. ETF investors are more enthusiastic about tech and growth stocks than they were last year. Younger generations of investors are more likely than older generations to express interest in investments like crypto and alternative ETFs. Millennials also want to increase their allocation to fixed-income ETFs.  Market volatility, high interest rates, inflation and the upcoming presidential election haven't affected the investment strategies of most exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. Most ETF investors surveyed by Charles Schwab (SCHW) Asset Management said that these economic and political events did not change the way they invest in ETFs. In fact, roughly a third of the investors put more money into ETFs based on their reading of stock market volatility, high interest rates and persistent inflation, according to the survey results released this week. ETFs have a track record across market cycles, said David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Innovation and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, adding that \"investors are confident in their investments even when the outlook is uncertain.” ETF investors have grown more bullish on certain types of stocks and sectors since last year: 69% are bullish on technology and 60% on growth stocks. Additionally, 55% of investors are optimistic about the the Magnificent 7, a group of seven mega-cap technology companies including Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). The Mag 7 stocks have a big influence on the stock markets and have driven much of the S&P 500's returns over the past year. But when they falter, as they did in July this year, they tend to drag the broader stock market down with them. The survey also showed how investment preferences vary across generations. For instance, 62% of millennials (or those born between 1981 and 1996), said they plan to invest in cryptocurrency ETFs over the next year versus 15% of Boomers (or those born between 1946 and 1964). A quarter of millennials said they plan to invest in alternatives ETFs, compared with just 11% of boomers. At the same time, 44% of millennials also want to increase their exposure to lower-risk fixed income ETFs. In contrast, fewer GenX (34%) and Boomer (26%) investors plan to do likewise.   ",

The company expects third-quarter net revenue of $302 million – $309 million versus the consensus of $289.37 million. Also, Indivior trimmed its FY24 net revenue outlook to $1.125 billion – $1.165 billion (consensus $1.185 billion) from $1.15 billion – $1.215 billion. In particular, the company now expects lower-than-anticipated net revenue for SUBLOCADE, with projected net revenue of $187 million – $192 million in the third quarter and $725 million – $745 million (versus $765 million to $805 million expected earlier) for FY24. Mark Crossley, CEO of Indivior, stated, “We are seeing faster than expected initial adoption of the competitive product to SUBLOCADE. This dynamic, together with greater variability in the timing of funding among Criminal Justice System customers, as well as incremental trade stocking pressure, has resulted in net revenue below our expectations set out in July. We are reducing our FY 2024 guidance to reflect these impacts.” Also, looking to the year ahead, the company expects pressure on SUBLOCADE volume growth from continued initial competitor adoption as the U.S. market adjusts to two long-acting injectable products. Indivior maintained its expectation for peak net revenue from SUBLOCADE to exceed $1.5 billion but no longer anticipates a run rate of $1 billion by the end of 2025. Crossle added, “We remain firm in our conviction that SUBLOCADE has a differentiated and optimal profile for opioid use disorder (OUD) patients, including our belief that it will best meet the increasing challenges that synthetic opioids are presenting to OUD patients and treatment providers.” ”Additionally, we expect SUBLOCADE’s profile to be further enhanced with important label updates in February 2025 that, if approved by the FDA, are expected to improve both the patient and healthcare provider experience.” Apart from this, the company reiterated outlook for an adjusted gross margin in low to mid 80% range and lowered adjusted operating profit guidance to $260 million – $280 million (from $285 million – $320 million) for 2024.

DUBAI — Crypto exchange OKX has gone live in the UAE offering a dirham (AED)-denominated order book and integration with a local bank as it looks to attract retail clients and entice institutions that may have been reluctant to participate in the crypto market. The opening, nine months after OKX Middle East Fintech FZE was granted full regulatory approval by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), will allow one of the four biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume to offer local residents access to a market without involving a broker who buys liquidity from outside the UAE, usually at a higher price, adding time and friction, said Rifad Mahasneh, the exchange's general manager for the Middle East. \"We have two targets – to be the retail app of choice and market and to start converting institutions in the UAE to enter the space,\" Mahasneh said in an interview. \"The return on investment is going to come from our ability to convert traditional institutions.\" The combination of giving access to a regulated derivatives product, local-currency product and local banking channel could give entities representing global institutions, which have so far been sitting on the sidelines, comfort to trade, Mahasneh said. The company's banking partner is Zand Bank, which calls itself the UAE's first fully licensed, all-digital bank. OKX is the first major exchange to go live with the combination of \"an AED banking integration and an AED order book,\" retail and institutional availability, and the first to offer regulated derivatives in the market, Mahasneh said. It will offer 280 tokens and 400 trading pairs in the region. Binance and Crypto.com are the other major international exchanges with full licenses from VARA. After announcing a partnership with Standard Chartered in August, Crypto.com's retail app is now available in the UAE, the company told CoinDesk in an email. Binance did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment about whether it had gone live in the UAE. VARA's public register shows OKX's license was issued Sept. 17. \"While that's VARA reflecting it's confident of you as a firm to operate in this space, the license comes with certain conditions that you need to complete before you go live,\" Mahasneh said. \"We wanted to test the product too.

Nvidia's Blackwell GPU is on schedule and is sold out for the next 12 months, the company said. Inference computing growth boosts the long-term demand potential for Nvidia's AI GPU chips. Nvidia stock is poised for more gains as its GPU chip business continues to see surging demand. That's according to Morgan Stanley, which hosted meetings with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and other members of the chip maker's management team for three days in New York City this week. The key takeaway is that \"every indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said. The bank reiterated its \"Overweight\" and \"Top Pick\" ratings and $150 price target, representing potential upside of 12% from current levels. Moore said Nvidia's production ramp of its next-generation Blackwell GPU chip is \"progressing on schedule,\" adding that the product is sold out for the next 12 months. \"Any new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor through the year,\" Moore explained. Hopper is Nvidia's previous generation of AI-enabled GPU chips, which are being sold in clusters to cloud \"hyperscalers\" like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. And Nvidia has a new \"element\" to its story, according to Moore, which is the view that inference computing \"is starting to solve much more complex problems which will require a much richer mix of hardware.\" That should be a boon for Nvidia's GPU chip product set, according to the note. \"The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of \"digital AI employees\" that can execute challenging tasks,\" Moore said. He added: \"The notion that a more thoughtful, task oriented inference would cause an exponential jump in inference complexity strikes us an important new avenue for growth, and another clear area where NVIDIA's full stack approach to solving these problems adds to the company's considerable lead.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made it clear to Morgan Stanley that the company expects to see meaningful growth in 2025 that spills over into 2026, \"though he did not quantify,\" Moore said.

Most Read from Bloomberg San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures expected one-month volatility on the S&P 500 Index, reached about 14 points above the 10-day realized volatility. It’s a level that’s only been exceeded for extended periods in 2008 and 2020-2021 during times when the market was recovering from severe selloffs as a result of the Global Financial Crisis and Covid. Robert Knopp, co-head of the S&P options desk at Optiver in Chicago, said upcoming events such as the US presidential election and earnings season are contributing to the spread. “While recent realized volatility is often predictive of upcoming realized volatility, in this case, these events are contributing to expectations of higher volatility,” he wrote. And while the divergence is not totally uncommon, the timing is. Usually the two measures have a bigger positive gap when tensions in the market are rising and the VIX Index is trading at higher levels. Even though the VIX has increased from the low levels seen from mid-2023 through mid-July, it’s just around the five-year average. Since the market volatility spike in early August, Knopp said there’s been a “combination of greater demand for hedging together with less willingness from market participants to warehouse short-volatility positions at the same levels that we observed prior to August 5.” Some of the early-October increase of about 5 points in the VIX to above 20 may be mechanical, as S&P options around the Nov. 5 US election day became part of the index’s calculation. But it also signals investors are seeking some protection, with looming risks from geopolitical tension to interest rates, macro economic concerns and the upcoming earnings season, in addition to the presidential election. The S&P 500 Index, however, has been little changed as the benchmark consolidates near all-time highs. “Generally, a larger gap is often a bullish signal over medium-term horizons, like three to six months,” said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. “This is because the market tends to price in rising volatility risk, which often doesn’t materialize. The eventual resolution of these events could reduce volatility, leading to positive market returns.”        "

The data do not include sales by Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Tesla and Nissan and a growing number of Chinese brands that have entered the market in the last two years, as well as domestic electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast. The market expanded for the sixth consecutive month in September from very weak year-earlier levels, after eighteen months of almost incessant declines. Heavy discounting by dealers helped support the market last month, as did the 50% vehicle registration tax discount introduced by the government in September and effective for three months. Third-quarter GDP growth came in at 7.4% year-on-year, up from 6.9% in the second quarter, driven by strong industrial output and exports - despite a series of powerful typhoons hitting the country in the last two months causing widespread damage and flooding. VAMA’s member data shows the market expanded by 2% to 193,854 units in the first nine month of 2024 from 190,130 a year earlier, including a 1% decline in passenger vehicle sales to 142,910 units while commercial vehicle sales increased by 12% to 50,944 units. Truong Hai (Thaco) group, the local assembler and distributor of several overseas brands and a major player in the commercial vehicle segment, reported a 10% drop in group sales to 60,546 units year-to-date. This includes an 18% drop in Kia sales to 22,948 units and an 11% fall in Mazda sales to 21,274 units, while sales of Thaco commercial vehicle increased by 6% to 12,858 units. Toyota’s nine-month volumes increased by 5% at 40,503 units, with sales of the Hilux pickup truck being stepped up in recent months. Ford, saw its sales rise by 6% to 28,038 units - underpinned by the popular Ranger, Everest and Transit models; while Mitsubishi’s sales increased by 29% to 27,933 units - lifted by the launch of the XForce SUV at the beginning of the year; followed by Honda with 17,654 units (+17%); and Suzuki with 7,985 units (-26%). The latest data released by Hyundai’s local distributor showed 34,389 vehicles were sold under the South Korean brand in the first eight months of 2024. VinFast said its global sales increased by 92% year-on-year to 21,747 units in the first half of 2024 and confirmed it is targeting 80,000 sales over the full year – in a growing number of markets in South-east Asia and the Middle-East as well as in the US. The Vietnamese government confirmed it will keep the registration tax for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) at 0% until 2026 while the special consumption tax will be kept at between 1% and 3%, as part of a broader package of incentives aimed at attracting BEV sector investment into the country – including cuts in import duties on components and charging equipment.

        "body": "By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors will be looking for evidence that investment in artificial intelligence among S&P 500 companies is beginning to pay off as the reporting season progresses, despite the fact that analysts expect profit growth to decelerate from the previous quarter. S&P 500 earnings are estimated to have increased 5.3% over the year-ago quarter, down from a second-quarter gain of 13.2%, but technology and communication services sectors are forecast to have the strongest year-over-year growth, according to LSEG data as of Friday. The earnings period unofficially kicks off this week, with reports from major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo due Friday. AI-related companies have dominated earnings since last year, and optimism over AI plans have helped to drive strong gains in the market. The S&P 500 is at record high levels and up roughly 21% for the year so far, with tech and communication services leading sector gains since Dec. 31. \"Many analysts will start looking at how and if a lot of these larger companies can monetize the model that they're training, and we've seen the ones that have been able to do so have been rewarded quite well,\" said Howard Chan, chief executive officer of Kurv Investment Management in San Francisco. Technology sector earnings in aggregate are expected to have gained 15.4% from the year-ago quarter, while communication services earnings are seen up 12.3%, based on LSEG data. Shares of Meta Platforms jumped on Aug. 1, a day after it issued an upbeat sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its AI investments. \"Companies like Microsoft and Google, they're spending quite a bit, but it's a little bit less understood... how that will interplay with their existing businesses,\" Chan said. Investors may also be hoping earnings can justify higher stock prices. With the S&P 500 at record high levels, the index is now trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note Wednesday that third-quarter results could provide a catalyst for gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. \"We continue to favor the semiconductor space and megacaps for AI exposure,\" she wrote, noting that she expects tech and AI companies to beat results for the quarter ended in September and also raise their outlooks.

Orano is also developing new projects in Mongolia and Uzbekistan, while remaining “in monitoring mode” for potential acquisitions, he said. “We have interest in diversifying our projects as there are some tensions in the East and in Africa,” Maes said at the company’s uranium enrichment plant in central France. “Questions over where uranium will come from in the next decade are pulling prices higher.” Uranium has soared over the past three years as investors piled into the commodity and governments from China to Europe plan more nuclear power plants, partly to curb carbon emissions. At the same time, production issues in Kazakhstan and a military coup in Niger have impacted uranium output.

That production can’t be exported out of the landlocked African nation due to persisting geopolitical issues, he added. The cost of enriching uranium — a key step to transform the radioactive metal into fuel — has also jumped since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as some western utilities seek to replace Kremlin-controlled Rosatom for their processing requirements. To help fill that gap, Orano broke ground on the expansion of its French enrichment facility this year. It expects to boost its global market share of enrichment services to 16% from 12%, when the project is completed by the end of the decade, the CEO said. Rosatom is the world’s largest enricher of uranium, with 43% of total production capacity, according to Orano. That’s followed by Urenco Ltd., a UK-Dutch-German group with a 31% share, and China National Nuclear Corp. with 13%.          "

Investors also channelised capital into liquid money market funds as they awaited a much-anticipated update on Beijing's stimulus measures this weekend. According to LSEG data, global money market funds gained a net $24.55 billion worth of inflows during the week after witnessing about $22.78 billion of net purchases in the prior week. Investors readjusted their views on future Fed rate cuts last week following a stronger than expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for the last month, boosting demand for low-risk assets. Asian money market funds saw a significant $12.88 billion inflow, the highest since Jan. 10. European and U.S. funds also witnessed $7.78 billion and $2.54 billion worth of net purchases, respectively. Demand for riskier equity funds, however, cooled as investors purchased just $3.65 billion of global equity funds compared with $35.97 billion of net acquisitions in the prior week. Tech, financials, and metals and mining sector funds received a notable $572 million, $417 million and $148 million, respectively, while the healthcare sector suffered $520 million worth of net sales. Overseas China equity funds attracted a sharp $8.52 billion, the biggest amount for a week since at least December 2020. Global bond funds attracted investments for the 42nd consecutive week as investors pumped $12.43 billion into these funds. Investors snapped up short-term bond funds of a net $2.16 billion following $3.3 billion of net sales a week ago.

Boeing had roughly 171,000 employees as of December 2023, according to an SEC filing. \"We've got an aircraft manufacturer that's in very, very deep trouble. What they did here is not a drill,\" Mike Boyd, president of aviation consulting firm Boyd Group International, told Yahoo Finance on Friday following the job cut announcement. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. The work stoppage has interrupted the company's recovery efforts, which include ramping up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets to 38 per month by the end of the year, up from roughly 25 per month in June and July. Estimates from S&P Global put the cost of the strike at roughly $1 billion per month after taking into consideration cost-saving measures the company has taken in response to it. Earlier this week, the credit rating agency placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the work stoppage continues until the end of the year. Riskier credit makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to borrow money. S&P expects Boeing will incur a cash outflow of approximately $10 billion in 2024. As a result, Wall Street analysts expect Boeing will need to raise cash through an equity offering. At the end of the second quarter, Boeing had roughly $58 billion in total debt and $12.6 billion in cash. “Based on our conversations with investors, it should be no surprise that Boeing is looking at an equity raise. We think most investors have been expecting the company to raise more than $10B, most likely following the conclusion of the machinists strike,\" JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman and his team wrote in a recent note. The analysts note the size of the raise could be determined by how long the strike lasts, and investors would be more reluctant to sign on with one still underway.             ",

Projects in the space are creating technologies that stand to change, at least to a degree, the reigning cloud computing model, while providing users with sustainable economic incentives to uphold the networks. This could be the basis for new models of economic development. The decentralization of cloud computing is the creation of a two-sided marketplace. Node networks, the most common infrastructure underpinning DePIN projects, are an efficient and secure way for users to actually own parts of the network. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure. Physical assets like telecom infrastructure or video streaming networks can be divided up, apportioned and owned by node owners for a small profit. Users then pay to access that network that is sustained by the many, instead of owned by the few. We need to consider the importance of node operators to a local economy and local innovations. DePIN networks might actually enable the little guy to win, for once. For example, Helium’s network is being deployed for livestock tracking in Africa, helping to protect endangered species while supporting farmers’ livelihoods. Helium CEO Abhay Kumar CEO noted that: \"The cow in this case, or the livestock in this case, is sort of the center of the economy for this community.” Indeed, this is a local innovation born from DePIN. In the emerging markets, physical infrastructure is unreliable or even nonexistent. Those markets therefore stand to be the first mover of mass adoption of decentralized networks of nodes. This is because nodes can be a small business, akin to operating a produce stall or a bicycle repair shop. So we need to think of nodes as “micro businesses franchises” rather than an immediate cypherpunk global revolution in radical decentralization. DePIN is not a crypto gimmick; it’s actually a small business for node operators New ideas take time. Yet, technology is often adopted much faster in the emerging markets. Banking adoption in Africa skipped internet banking and went straight to mobile banking. Localized innovations meant African payments and credit business models emerged. This is how we should think about DePIN, a slow revolution that the big tech giants won’t see coming as it emerges gradually through various local drivers in certain geographies. Drivers such as the utility of operating a computing node as a small business. The DePIN supply-side business model is already slowly changing how we think about ownership of physical infrastructure networks. Still, on the demand side for Westerners this might not yet be a revolutionary moment. I’ll just stick with Zoom or Telegram and rely on AWS Cloud, thanks. Just a side hustle for Western node operators, this could be a personal finance game changer for node operators in emerging markets.              "

Guests were soaking up the atmosphere, and paying millions for the works on display. At Frieze Masters, where the focus is on historic rather than contemporary art, Hauser & Wirth sold an Édouard Manet painting for 4.5 million euros; a Francis Picabia work for $4 million, and an Arshile Gorky oil painting called “The Opaque” for $8.5 million “Our theme is quality, and the pieces we have are part of art history, as well as the history of our culture. We’ve observed that there’s a growing interest in quality,” said Carlo Knöll, senior director at the Swiss gallery, which counts Princess Eugenie as a director. Gallerists said the fair is able to attract a diverse international crowd. “There were far more people in town from abroad than [anticipated]. It’s nice to see that London is still very much on the map,” said Alison Jacques, whose eponymous gallery had booths at Frieze London and Frieze Masters. Jacques said a group of works from young artist Sophie Birber was sold, with prices rang from 9,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds. The gallery also sold a painting from Nicola L. for $125,000 and a piece from Ana Mendieta sold for $75,000. Lisa De Simone, a representative from Elliott Fine Art, said “the beauty of London is that it’s a true melting pot. We’ve talked to people from so many different regions such as Europe, North and South America and Asia.” The gallery put a focus on female artists who have been previously neglected in history, but who are now being rediscovered, and celebrated. The works of Françoise Gilot, Giovanna Garzoni and Suzanne Fabry were on display, with the latter’s “Triple self portrait” selling for 50,000 pounds.

With Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a close race to win the Nov. 5 election, we look at what matters most for world markets. EUROPE IN THE BALANCE For European equity markets, a Trump victory could spell trouble for export-heavy sectors, particularly German automakers such as BMW but also LVMH and other luxury goods makers as concerns of renewed trade tensions loom. Barclays has warned of possible \"high single-digit\" percentage drops in European earnings should trade conflicts reignite. Trump has floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10-20% on virtually all imports to boost U.S. manufacturing. On the flip side, a Harris win would be a relatively better outcome for European equities. This could energize renewable energy, a possible tailwind for utilities with large U.S. projects like Orsted and Iberdrola. Over the longer term, however, her plans to raise corporate taxes from 21% to 28% could curb margins for American firms and European dollar earners alike. A further cut under Trump would likely be welcomed on both sides of the Atlantic. The election could have implications for the war in Ukraine. Trump and some Republicans in Congress have questioned the value of U.S. funding for Ukraine's two-year battle against Russia, while Democrats have pushed to bolster Ukraine. Aerospace and defense stocks have gained over 80%since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. CURRENCY SWINGS Trade tariffs are key for traders in the world's most-actively traded currencies. The euro, trading below September's 14-month peaks at around $1.09, is seen as being in the losing camp if a Trump win means higher universal tariffs. \"A Trump win, in the eyes of the market, would take euro/dollar down to the $1.05 area, whereas a win for Harris would see the rate move in the opposite direction, above $1.15,\" said BlueBay Asset Management CIO Mark Dowding. Geopolitical risks, especially in the Middle East, that trigger a surge in oil prices and hurt economic growth, also make the euro vulnerable, analysts said. ING added that a Trump win could also hurt the Australian and New Zealand dollars -- currencies of economies dependent on trade from China, a main target of higher tariffs. Around 37% of Australia's and 29% of New Zealand’s exports land in China, ING noted. The Swedish and Norwegian currencies were also seen as vulnerable to global trade dynamics, while Canada's dollar could suffer if a Harris win is viewed negatively for the U.S. economy.

        "body": "Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell by about 2.7% in overnight trading on brokerage firm Robinhood after the company’s robotaxi unveiling event late on Thursday failed to give investors confidence. What Happened: Tesla on Thursday unveiled a two-seater Cybercab that can drive itself and a robovan with no pedals that can accommodate about 20 passengers at an event in Los Angeles on Thursday. The event, however, was thin on details with the company not divulging the cost of the robovan. Musk also said that the smaller Cybercab will join the company’s autonomous taxi fleet only by 2026. The CEO further remarked that he is often optimistic about timelines, hinting at chances of delay. Don’t Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. Why It Matters: Tesla investors were hoping the robotaxi unveiling event would give the stock a much-needed boost after the company’s third-quarter delivery numbers announced earlier this month sent the stock on a downward journey. Tesla delivered 462,890 vehicles in the third quarter, marking an increase of 6.4% from the corresponding period last year, but below estimates. The company has previously said that it expects a lower delivery growth rate this year as compared to the last. However, it has not issued specific delivery guidance for the year. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Some analysts, including Deepwater Asset Management's Managing Partner Gene Munster, had expected Tesla to unveil a cheaper, mass-market EV at the event on Thursday in addition to the robotaxi to ramp delivery numbers in the coming year. Price Action: At the time of writing, the Tesla stock was down by 2.7% on overnight trading on Robinhood. Year-to-date, Tesla shares are down nearly 4%, after the stock closed down 0.95% at $238.77 on Thursday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The population of the city stood at 59,471 in 2023, representing a 2.7% increase from the prior year and 9.8% jump from 2020, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Bentonville is located in Northwestern Arkansas, a fast-growing region where companies like Walmart, J.B. Hunt and Tyson Foods all have their headquarters. A forecast from the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission suggested over 1 million could call Northwest Arkansas home by 2050.

Read On The Fox Business App \"We’re the home of Walmart, and we’re the home of J.B. Hunt and also the home of Tyson, and Walmart has spent a ton of energy in making this a very recruitable place,\" The Agency Bentonville Managing Partner Kaala House told FOX Business. \"Our market is growing so intensely, especially starting after COVID because a lot of people wanted to get out of the city where they could be outside and things like that. We have become, in the last couple years, we’ve become the mountain biking capital of the United States in Bella Vista. And so that’s making us extremely recruitable for Walmart, who’s bringing back their employees as well.\" The real estate market around Bentonville has seen an 8.5% increase in home sales in the first half of 2024 from a year ago, The Agency Bentonville agent Katlyn Munch said. Benton County, where Bentonville is located, and two nearby counties notched 4,799 home sales over the first six months of the year, according to a recent Skyline Report from Arvest Bank and the University of Arkansas published online by NWAHomepage. That figure represented a 2.7% rise from the latter half of 2023, the report found. Munch also noted 39.5% of all homes sold were new construction. \"We’re at an all-low inventory rate. There’s a lot of people that are holding on to that COVID two-point interest rate, and so we’ve got a lot of people that are holding their homes that they don’t want to sell because they have such a great rate, and then the prices have gone up so much since that time too,\" House said. \"So we have a lot of new construction inventory right now. I think the average was, if we closed 29 new houses a day, we wouldn’t have enough houses, because we average 37 people-a-day increase in population.\" Bentonville has \"a little bit more\" of a buyer’s market at the moment, she said, citing interest rates, the upcoming election and other factors.

Alongside all the outward cheer, volatility is an equally big story in almost every asset class. Traders, who got blindsided when things turned violently against them in August and September, are piling into hedges — pushing the cost of protection up almost as fast as markets themselves. The rush is creating unusual contours across assets. In one example, volatility indexes in equities and Treasuries just capped two of their bigger weekly advances of the year. The runups left both fear gauges at their highest in more than two decades — when plotted against other periods when the S&P 500 sat at a record. All in, sentiment remains febrile among key constituencies on Wall Street, thanks to next month’s US election, the uncertain Federal Reserve policy trajectory and recent market traumas. “The odds that a low-probability, very bad event will happen are higher,” said Amy Wu Silverman, head of derivatives strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “Post the August VIX spike markets have normalized and made new highs. Yet, the underlying ‘worry’ had remained elevated.” While asset prices frequently rise at times of investor anxiety, the situation now is especially extreme, with bullishness and skepticism both evident in equal parts. The S&P 500 has risen for five straight weeks and in eight of the last nine, closing Friday at its 45th record of the year after earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. topped estimates. US investment-grade bond spreads are the narrowest in more than three years. At the same time, with market plunges of early August and September fresh in traders’ minds, gauges of investor nervousness are flashing readings of caution that are rare during bullish regimes. Both the Cboe Volatility Index in equities and the ICE BofA MOVE Index in Treasuries have risen sharply since the start of the month. A global measure of cross-asset risk kept by Bank of America Corp. has hit the second-highest level of the year — eclipsed by only the early August selloff, which erased trillions of dollars from global share values in a matter of days. The indicator tracks stress across global equities, rates, currencies and commodities and measures future price swings implied by options.                  "

Equity traders worried that the start of Federal Reserve rate cuts would sap bank profits saw things weren’t that bad, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. churning out a surprise increase in net interest income. At Wells Fargo & Co., NII slumped — but the firm expects that drop to be less steep in the last quarter. Each stock rose at least 4.4%, pushing the KBW Bank Index to the highest since April 2022. “We expect earnings season to be solid, including the big banks,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Credit card delinquencies are still very low and increased economic activity should drive bank revenues.” The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, extending gains into a fifth straight week — its longest winning run since May. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1%. The Russell 2000 climbed 2.1%. Tesla Inc. dropped 8.8% after the unveiling of its Robotaxi was light on specifics. Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. jumped over 9.5%. Treasuries saw small moves, with shorter maturities outperforming. A Bloomberg gauge of US bonds posted a fourth straight week of declines. The dollar barely budged, while capping a second consecutive week of gains in anticipation of a slower pace of rate cuts. West Texas Intermediate oil settled below $76 a barrel. “Now that the Fed has started its rate-cutting cycle, the economy should get a further boost from lower interest rates on things like credit card debt and business loans,” said David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management. “As a result, we expect third-quarter earnings results will be consistent with recent, healthy trends.” In non-recessionary scenarios, the S&P 500 rises 17% on average in the 12 months after the Fed starts to cut rates, Lefkowitz noted. He reiterated his S&P 500 price targets of 5,900 and 6,200 for December 2024 and June 2025. Apollo’s Torsten Slok noted that financials have been among top outperformers during the Fed’s rate cutting cycles that end with a “soft landing.”                                           ",

The electric vehicle maker also revealed a larger \"Robovan\" and showcased its Optimus humanoid robot. Analysts had said prior to the event that they expected Tesla could announce a lower-cost vehicle to be released next year, but the company did not mention one.  Tesla (TSLA) shares stumbled Friday morning as markets appeared to be initially unimpressed with the electric vehicle (EV) maker's \"We, Robot\" event last night, which included the unveiling of autonomous taxi and van models. The autonomous taxi, called the \"Cybercab,\" will go into production by 2026 once Tesla has approval from regulators for its full self-driving software, which Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said should be rolled out in California and Texas by next year for its Model 3 and Model Y. At the event, Musk also revealed the \"Robovan,\" a larger autonomous vehicle designed to carry groups of people or cargo, along with showcasing Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot, with some helping serve drinks, dance, and perform other functions. The van and robot have not received official release dates, but Musk had said previously that Optimus would perform tasks in Tesla factories next year and would be sold to other companies in 2026. One factor pressuring Tesla's stock could be that analysts had said they expected the company could reveal a lower-cost vehicle that could be released next year. Wedbush analysts said in a Friday note that the lack of a \"Model 2\" announcement is the \"elephant in the room this morning,\" as they also acknowledged that Musk and Tesla \"ideally\" should have spent more time on details like how the robotaxi network will operate. However, the Wedbush analysts said they would \"be buyers on any weakness this morning\" as they left the \"We, Robot\" event \"more bullish on the Tesla story.\" Bank of America analysts affirmed their \"buy\" rating on Tesla's stock, saying the \"Robotaxi event lived up to the hype.\" Tesla stock has been trending lower since third-quarter deliveries data released last week beat estimates but perhaps by not as wide a margin as investors had hoped. The EV maker faces another catalyst for its shares later this month, when it reports Q3 earnings Oct. 23. Tesla shares, which recently fell back into negative territory for the year, were down more than 8% at $218.81 soon after markets opened Friday.   ",

Recommended Reading United Airlines takes flight with airline industry’s first media network NEW YORK — United Airlines in June unveiled Kinective Media, billed as the airline industry’s first media network. Drawing insights and data from 110 million travelers and 40 million MileagePlus frequent flyers, the offering quickly partnered with brands including Norwegian Cruise Line, Macy’s, Chase United Co-Brand Credit Cards and more. Mike Petrella was hired as managing director of strategic partnerships in September 2023 and has served as a key leader in the development of Kinective Media. Previously, the executive spent 23 years in the same corporate ecosystem, from being the third employee at Advertising.com through acquisitions by AOL and Yahoo. Petrella was “amazed” at how dynamic United was expanding into a white space area as a nearly 100-year-old company. “I thought I was coming into an old school environment, but even our CEO is very forward thinking,” Petrella said. “The way he communicates to his leadership team is very ‘fail first, fail fast, fail forward,’ and I wasn’t expecting that.” Marketing Dive spoke with Petrella between sessions at Advertising Week New York about the lessons he learned from helping stand up a media offering, the need for data privacy legislation and where the media landscape goes from here. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. MIKE PETRELLA: You need buy-in from everyone and I think that was the thing that was most impressive to me with the team. There was a willingness to be educated and influenced. One of my friends gave me the best advice: You may not know all the answers, but you know the questions to ask. You have to educate yourself in terms of the other building blocks. So from a data perspective, where is our data set today, where do we want it to go tomorrow? As we build a sales organization, how do we build in such a manner that is conducive and complementary to what we’ve stood up ahead of their presence? We were smart in terms of the choices we made, because it allowed us to be dynamic and fluid. We didn’t get locked into anything, and that was the key. In this industry, everything changes and nothing changes all at once, but you have to be able to pivot quickly.                  "

The revelation comes following a lawsuit filed in an Illinois district court Thursday evening by crypto derivatives exchange Bitnomial, which sued Wall Street’s top cop over its claim that it has jurisdiction over a planned futures contract that tracks the price of XRP, the seventh-largest digital asset by market cap. Bitnomial, which is regulated by the SEC’s sister agency the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, filed for the XRP US Dollar Futures contract in August following the conclusion of the SEC’s lawsuit against blockchain payments firm Ripple, where a federal judge ruled against the SEC’s claim that XRP is a security. Exodus Donates $1.3M To Crypto Advocacy Group To Aid Election Day Vote Efforts According to Bitnomial’s lawsuit, the SEC contacted the exchange shortly after the filing, claiming that XRP Futures are \"security futures\" that are subject to joint SEC and CFTC jurisdiction, and that Bitnomial would be violating federal securities laws if it proceeded with the listing. The SEC also said Bitnomial would be required to comply with additional requirements before listing XRP Futures, including registering as a national securities exchange. \"The SEC takes the view that the underlying asset, XRP, is an investment contract and, therefore, transactions in XRP constitute a security under the Securities Exchange Act,\" the lawsuit states. \"Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures.\" Read On The Fox Business App The SEC declined to comment. Tether Looks To Revamp Us Image As It Celebrates 10 Years The SEC's claim that XRP futures are securities futures is a further escalation in the turf war between the securities regulator and the commodities regulator, which are currently vying for sole jurisdiction over digital assets. The biggest question remains whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or commodities and, in the absence of a regulatory framework, the status of certain tokens is being decided by the courts. The CFTC currently oversees futures contracts for bitcoin and ether, the only two digital assets the SEC has deemed to be non-securities. In addition to seeking a declaration from a judge that XRP Futures are not securities futures, Bitnomial is asking the court to issue an order that prevents the SEC from claiming authority over XRP Futures and taking any legal action against the exchange related to its product offering.

On Oct. 8, the Financial Times reported that in Guadalajara, Mexico, Foxconn would construct the largest factory focused on producing Nvidia's most advanced artificial-intelligence servers. Foxconn is one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturers and is also a supplier for Apple’s iPhones. 💸 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's FREE daily newsletter 💸 Foxconn will assemble Nvidia’s GB200, a superchip built on its Blackwell architecture, combining two Blackwell graphics-processing units with a Grace central processing unit. This design enables the GB200 to handle intense AI workloads, like real-time processing of trillion-parameter models. Related: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just told investors what’s next for the AI chipmaker \"We're building the largest GB200 production facility on the planet,\" said Benjamin Ting, Foxconn senior vice president for the cloud enterprise solutions business group, Reuters reported. This move indicates a shift in Nvidia's supply chain away from Asia. With the majority of Nvidia's chip production based in the area, investors are worried about geopolitical risks that could hinder Nvidia’s deliveries and revenue. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, said in September that Nvidia can switch to alternative suppliers as it has enough intellectual property. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is now Nvidia’s biggest supplier. “Maybe the process technology is not as great, maybe we won't be able to get the same level of performance or cost, but we will be able to provide the supply,\" Huang said at Goldman Sachs’s Communacopia + Technology Conference. \"And so I think ... in the event anything were to happen, we should be able to pick up and fab it somewhere else,” On Aug. 28, Nvidia released another solid earnings report. For the quarter ended July 28, the company posted adjusted earnings of 68 cents a share, more than double the figure from the year-earlier figure and beating the analyst consensus of 64 cents.

Backed by the rise of artificial intelligence euphoria and a surprisingly resilient US economy, the S&P 500 has gained more than 60% in the past two years and is hovering near an all-time high. Wall Street strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance believe the bull can keep running wild. Barring any unexpected shocks, the path higher appears to be clear, with earnings growth expected to keep accelerating and the economy on seemingly solid footing as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. A bull market for the S&P 500 was officially declared in June 2023 when the index rose 20% from its recent bear market low. History says this bull market still has legs. At two years, the bull market is well shy of the average run of 5.5 years. And the total return thus far, about 60%, is a far cry from the average 180% gain, per research from Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick. In the past few weeks, several Wall Street equity strategists have made the case for the benchmark index to rise further into both year-end and into 2025, supported by accelerating earnings for the S&P 500. \"We continue to be surprised by the strength of market gains and decided yet again that something more than an incremental adjustment was warranted,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski wrote in a September note when raising his year-end price target for the S&P 500 to a Street high of 6,100 from a previous target of 5,600. On Oct. 4, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target to 6,000 and initiated a 12-month target of 6,300. Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin did note, though, that already high valuations could limit the upside for how far the index can reach in 2025. Strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance agreed with Kostin that already stretched valuations present a challenge to how much higher stocks can go. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon noted that dating back to the mid-1960s, the only time valuations have been this stretched on a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio were 2021 and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. \"This would tell you that the bull is much older or somewhat near the end of this life,\" Gordon said. But strategists often warn that a high valuation itself isn't a proper tool for calling the end of a bull market. Stocks can trade at what are considered to be expensive valuations for longer than expected. What that does tell investors is that much of the good news that could push stocks higher might've already been priced in.               ",

        "body": "Boeing has clearly had a turbulent year. From several safety incidents to the Starliner fiasco to bringing in a new CEO amid a massive workers’ strike, the company has endured blow after blow. And now, it appears the aviation giant is bleeding money. As of Sept. 27, the fallout from 33,000 workers striking accounted for a $1 billion reduction in U.S. GDP, according to economic analysis and modeling company IMPLAN. On Tuesday, Boeing suspended its ongoing negotiations with striking workers, accusing the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) of making unreasonable demands and withdrew its previous offer for a 30% pay increase over four years. As a result, Wells Fargo predicts Boeing will sell between $10 billion and $15 billion in new stock to account for lost earnings, according to an analyst note dated Oct. 9. Boeing previously targeted $10 billion in working cash on its balance sheet, and Wells Fargo estimates cash dropped to roughly $8 billion at the end of the third quarter. Boeing declined a request for comment from Fortune about whether the company would sell new stock. A $10 billion cash raise keeps balances above the $10 billion watermark through 2025, “but leaves little room for any further challenges while we don't think [Boeing] wants to go to equity markets twice,” according to the note. Still, Wells Fargo analysts say this leaves Boeing with about $30 billion to $40 billion in net debt. “This financial strain is compounded by the potential for a credit rating downgrade from agencies like S&P, which have already placed Boeing’s debt on watch,” Jon Morgan, CEO of business consultancy Venture Smarter, told Fortune. “Considering these factors, an equity offering seems a plausible step for Boeing to shore up its finances. The company needs to ensure it has sufficient liquidity to deal with the ongoing labor disputes and maintain its operations.” Considering it took 10 days for the union and Boeing to meet at the negotiating table when talks first fell apart on Sept. 27, Wells Fargo expects there may be “one more shot at getting a deal” before Boeing releases its latest earnings on Oct. 23. “We believe [Boeing] would like to reach a deal before raising further cash through an equity offering,” according to the analyst note. Wells Fargo analysts did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment on the exact timing of when we might expect an equity offering. However, Wells Fargo predicts the strike will likely stretch on for most of October, which could hit Boeing for another $2 billion or so in cash.         ",

The research firm CEO said perfect conditions are aligning for additional gains exceeding 50%. Other notable investors have been looking to buy the dip in Chinese stocks amid continued stimulus efforts. China's stock rally isn't over — and the nation could have the perfect cocktail of ingredients to stage a monster run-up over the next year, according to one Wall Street forecaster. Jeff deGraaf, the CEO of Renaissance Macro Research, says he sees China's benchmark stock index climbing to 6,000 over the next year. That implies a 54% increase from the CSI 300's current levels, thanks to the right mix of conditions in Beijing that should power equities higher, he told Bloomberg on Friday. \"Skepticism, valuation, stimulus, momentum and a trend change,\" deGraaf said of China's investing environment, adding that it was \"one of the best set-ups\" he's seen over his 35-year career. Chinese stocks have been on a roller coaster in recent weeks after Beijing announced its latest monetary stimulus package, which included lowering interest rates and pumping the stock market with $114 billion. The package sparked the steepest rally in Chinese stocks since 2008 before it quickly fizzled, a sign investors were disappointed Beijing didn't announce more stimulus measures. Markets, though, are expecting the nation to announce a fresh fiscal stimulus package at a briefing on Saturday, potentially reviving the bull case for stocks. Most investors expect China to add 2 trillion yuan, or $283 billion, in fiscal stimulus through 2025, according to a Bloomberg poll of market participants. \"We see the policy response as self-preservation, a reaction to the weakness and a potential Mario Draghi-esque 'Do what it takes' moment for China,\" deGraaf said, later urging investors to \"keep stops in place\" when betting on Chinese stocks. Other traders on Wall Street have shown interest in buying the dip in Chinese equities, despite fear that Beijing's economic slowdown could stick around. Investors poured a record $39.1 billion into Chinese stock funds in the week ending October 9, according to EPFR Global data cited by Bank of America in a note. \"We buy any China dips,\" BofA strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note. Stimulus efforts will continue to \"be used aggressively to boost domestic animal spirits and demand,\" he added. Additionally, the Shenzhen Huaan Hexin Private Investment Fund Management Co., a Chinese hedge fund up 800% since 2017, also says it's buying the dip in technology stocks listed in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index has dropped 3% over the last five trading days, but is still up 27% from levels at the start of the year.      "

BlackRock has pulled in $360 billion of total net inflows so far this year, surpassing the full-year net flows of 2022 and 2023. BlackRock “sets a high bar we expect few peers are likely to beat,” TD Cowen analysts wrote in a note after the earnings release. Shares of BlackRock rose 3.6% to $990 at 10:29 a.m. in New York. The firm pulled in $5.5 billion of total net flows for alternatives, compared with outflows of $4.2 billion a year ago. It reported $170 billion of illiquid alternative assets. That’s set to surge. After the third quarter ended, the firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, in a deal adding $116 billion of private market assets. BlackRock’s long-term investment funds took in $160 billion net flows in the period, a total that topped the $100 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company also had $61 billion in net flows to cash-management and money-market funds in the period. Operating income rose 26% from a year ago to $2.1 billion. The firm added $2.4 trillion to its total assets over the past 12 months. BlackRock is positioning itself as a single place for global clients to invest across public and private markets. It benefited this year from the surge in stocks and cash beginning to flow into fixed-income and private funds. The S&P 500 Index rose about 5.5% in the third quarter, and investors are betting the Federal Reserve won’t need to cut rates aggressively in the near-term to avoid a recession. BlackRock is in the process of closing a £2.55 billion ($3.3 billion) acquisition of private-markets data firm Preqin. The firm is also signaling that it wants to catch up in the fast-growing market for private credit, recently shaking up the senior executive team of its global private debt business and establishing a direct-lending group. BlackRock is exploring a purchase of HPS Investment Partners that could value the private credit firm in excess of $10 billion, Bloomberg reported this week.           ",

Recommended Reading Nespresso celebrates aluminum in environmental-forward campaign NEW YORK — Environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs are at an inflection point as brands come under pressure from activists to keep out of increasingly politicized areas. Nespresso USA, the Nestlé-owned coffee machine marketer, has stayed the course on making sustainability a core part of its positioning despite the brewing backlash. Last year, the company promoted brand and communications director Jessica Padula to the dual role of vice president of marketing and head of sustainability, a job with duties that can sometimes seem at odds. “You want to force everything into a marketing campaign when, in fact, it really shouldn’t be. Part of my job is actually saying yes or no,” said Padula. “There are things we’re going to communicate and there are some that we’re just going to do and we don’t need to get credit for it right now.” Nespresso, which has not been immune to criticisms over its use of disposable coffee pods, is placing renewed focus on materials in its marketing. A campaign launched during Climate Week NYC in September spotlights Nespresso’s decades-long history of using aluminum packaging, a material that is easier to recycle than plastic but can be energy intensive to produce. The company on Thursday also announced a partnership with Vital Proteins, another B Corp-certified brand, to launch a wellness pack that is being promoted with fitness expert Rad Lopez and Drew Barrymore, who will feature the product on her talk show. Marketing Dive sat down with Padula during Advertising Week New York, at Nespresso’s New York headquarters, to dig deeper on fostering loyalty and navigating the complexity of sustainability in 2024. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. JESSICA PADULA: The topic was about building a brand customers love, which for Nespresso is near and dear to our hearts. I was on a panel with Samsung and Snapchat, well-known consumer-facing brands. I think Nespresso and maybe coffee, as a category, is particularly unique because it’s an everyday consumption moment. If we’re doing it right, we’re being a part of every single day, which is maybe likened to your phone and unlike many other CPG or even FMCG categories. The other piece of Female Quotient that’s really important to us is they’re focused on empowerment and equity. That’s something that, as a purpose-driven brand, we want to over-index in and talk from that lens — not just about our case studies as a business. Consumers don’t always know [about that] and I think that’s a bit of a harder story for us to tell. I’ve been at Nespresso almost nine years, but it has changed significantly. One of the things that’s true — and this actually came up on the panel yesterday — is we’ve always been a direct-to-consumer brand and we’ve always done it in a way that’s high touch, similar to a luxury brand, even though we sell a commodity product. In the past five to 10 years, the capabilities you have with digital, CRM and sophisticated personalization continue to deliver on that luxury expectation. As a DTC brand, we have the benefit of having so much consumer data about what they’re buying, sometimes what they’re consuming if they have a Bluetooth-connected machine, we’re able to start to talk to them as real human beings, not just as a number in our database. We’ve never really sold through third-party retail and trade where there’s this intermediary between you and your end consumer. We’ve always had that one-to-one [relationship], which fundamentally changes our approach to business. It’s funny because it happened at Climate Week and at Adweek’s Brandweek, the same exact conversation around DEI and ESG and how it integrates with marketing strategy. My role continues to be pretty unique in that I lead both marketing and sustainability for the brand. When we talk about sustainability, it’s not like something we just did in the past five years. It’s fundamentally 30 years in the making. We’re working with not just ourselves to try to be sustainable, but a ton of nonprofit partners and NGOs who know how to do things better than we do. We are not farmers, but we need to support farms to make sure that we protect the land and can continue to grow and sell coffee in the future. They go so hand-in-hand, it’s not altruistic. That [backlash] trend doesn’t surprise me because I think there was a wave, post-pandemic, for brands to focus a lot on ESG and DEI, and in some cases that was not authentic to the roots of the company. If you’re able to tell the authentic story, then consumers are looking for values alignment. [Sustainability] doesn't have to be your top-level campaign. [Consumers] have to see that you act that way, and that’s in everything you do beyond marketing campaigns, which is why I think my role connecting the dots between the two can be tricky. I like to say that everything I learned about sustainability, I learned on the job at Nespresso. We’re a B Corp-certified company. That isn’t because we aspired to become B Corp-certified, but rather the actions we’ve taken for 30 years. Sustainability was set up for so long as doing less bad in the world as a business: Offset your emissions and do less harm. Marketing can tell the story of how you move from less bad to more good. The other thing is that a lot of sustainability leaders are not marketers. Many of the things I sat in on during Climate Week were very complex, difficult and technical topics. Because I don’t have a school education in those things, I’ve often had to say: Pause, break it down for me, help me understand. In many ways then, I’m actually like a consumer, because consumers don’t always understand the depth of that unless they’re a very niche audience. As a marketer, I’ve had to challenge myself. Once you get to a certain level in your marketing career, you’re like, “I know how to do this, I just have to stay on top of new technologies and I’m good.” Sustainability has made me stop and have to learn things from the ground up again, but then apply my marketing skills to be able to translate complex topics into something that’s digestible. Anything about Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. It’s funny to think that we expect consumers to understand these things in some ways. I really commend a brand like Allbirds that printed the CO2 emissions on the inside of the shoe. They’re not just trying to get credit for that, they’re trying to teach their consumers. My role is also really focused on the end of life of capsules and machines. I have had to learn so much about how recycling companies make money in the U.S., because we’re trying to motivate the recyclers to accept our capsules into their system so that you can recycle curbside. You can do that in New York. That took an investment with, not just the city of New York — DSNY [NYC Dept. of Sanitation] helped us — but a third-party company that does the recycling for New York City. We have to understand how they make money and what materials are more valuable for them in order to understand where aluminum and coffee grounds might fit into their business model. Maybe I’m silly, but I never thought of recycling as a business. I thought of it as a public service as a consumer. I’ve learned a ton of really technical [information] about how glass, plastic and metal get recycled, how they commingle, what that looks like, and then the business side of waste, which is not something you learn as a marketer but is a whole industry unto itself. It hasn’t changed as much as it’s opened new lines of communication. A good example is our Relove refurbished machine program. We are always looking at the next exciting machine innovation that’s coming out, but one of the questions that may not get asked if you’re purely a marketing or a salesperson on the commercial side is: If someone wants to upgrade their machine, what happens to their old machine? My role has made me connect those dots. I might want to sell [consumers] a new machine and upgrade them, but I also have to think about the end of life of their current machine. Are we serving the customer and are we serving the planet at the end of the day in this consumerism world that we live in? "

Following a rally to all-time highs, the S&P 500 took a breather. While Thursday’s economic figures were not perceived by Wall Street as catastrophic, they certainly highlighted the Fed’s challenge of bringing inflation back to the 2% target without cooling the jobs market too much. And that has added to the debate about the Fed’s next steps. For now, bond traders continued to bet the central bank will reduce the pace of cuts to 25 basis points in November. Three Fed policymakers — John Williams, Austan Goolsbee and Thomas Barkin were unfazed by a higher-than-forecast consumer price index, suggesting officials can continue lowering rates. The outlier was Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal he revealed that, in projections released in September, he had called for one additional quarter-point cut this year. The Fed has two remaining meetings in 2024. “One slightly hotter-than-expected CPI reading doesn’t mean a new wave of inflation has been unleashed, but the fact that it accompanied a jump in weekly jobless claims may add to short-term market uncertainty,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “These weren’t good numbers — but that doesn’t mean they upended the larger outlook for solid economic growth and moderate inflation.” In a note titled “The Fed’s quandary as inflation warmer while labor cooler,” Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial says the latest economic numbers were not the combination the Fed wants to see. “If inflation data continues to indicate that prices are generally rising amid a backdrop of a cooler labor market, the Fed’s next meeting will undoubtedly involve a more heated discussion of which of the Fed’s mandates takes precedence,” she noted. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%. Most major groups retreated, though energy shares joined oil higher as the market awaited Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack. Megacaps were mixed, with Nvidia Corp. up and Apple Inc. down. Tesla Inc. edged lower ahead of the launch of the company’s fully self-driving vehicle.                                                             "

But the rise in stocks puts major indexes at lofty valuations, leaving long-term investors wondering how they should proceed from here. Bankrate’s Third-Quarter Market Mavens Survey asked market professionals what, if anything, long-term investors should do with their portfolios as stocks trade near all-time highs. Here’s what they had to say.

The investment pros surveyed by Bankrate think now is a good time to review those allocations. “If investors only do one thing, they should rebalance portfolios back to their targeted allocations,” says Chris Fasciano, senior portfolio manager at Commonwealth Financial Network. Wells Fargo Investment Institute Senior Global Market Strategist Sameer Samana also says now is a good time to review your overall portfolio. “Update your financial plan, and rebalance in-line with the plan’s recommended allocations,” he says. Portfolio rebalancing and diversification go hand in hand. A key reason for portfolio rebalancing is to make sure your portfolio stays diversified and doesn’t have too much or too little exposure to any one asset class. “For long-term investors, holding well-diversified portfolios, or broad market indices, is generally a winning strategy,” says Dec Mullarkey, managing director at SLC Management. “While markets can seem over valued at different points, some companies will deliver the expected strong growth while others fail but leave market share for new competitors,” Mullarkey says. “So, sticking with well-diversified portfolios and periodically rebalancing to your long-term asset mix targets, tends to be a reliable formula to capture stable long-term performance.” With stocks at highs, some of the experts surveyed expressed a more cautious tone and suggested investors pay close attention to any holdings that may be particularly risky.

Despite macroeconomic pressures impacting the retail pharmacy sector, the analyst writes that CVS has shown resilience thanks to its diversified business model. Also Read: CVS, UnitedHealth Request FTC Chair Recusal Amid Ongoing Pharmacy Benefit Managers Lawsuit. This has allowed the company to mitigate some of these challenges and capitalize on market share gains from less financially stable competitors. For 2025, Barclays estimates market forecasts include expectations of 110 basis points in Medicare margin expansion, which is on the lower end of CVS’s target range of 100-200 bps. Barclays has upgraded CVS from Equal Weight to Overweight, with a price target of $82, up from $63. By 2026, projections show about 90 bps of margin improvement. Collectively, this suggests a cumulative recovery of 200 bps over two years, placing consensus Medicare margins at approximately -2.0%, which may underestimate the speed of CVS’s recovery. CVS is well-positioned to continue gaining market share in the retail pharmacy space, a trend that Barclays estimates could accelerate in 2025 as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) moves forward with plans to close over 1,000 of the roughly 2,000 unprofitable stores identified for closure. While the full impact of Walgreens’ store closures will depend on the timing—spread over the next three years—the analyst expects a significant number to close within the first year due to their unprofitability. CVS has consistently increased its pharmacy market share since the first quarter of 2020, holding 27.2% as of the first quarter of 2024. Barclays estimates CVS has been gaining approximately 5-10 bps of market share each quarter, with cumulative gains likely exceeding 150 bps since before the pandemic.

The expansion to new markets is part of the company’s plan to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms said that it aims to make its AI chatbot more accessible by supporting multiple languages and attracting a global user base. With nearly 500 million monthly active users, Meta AI will begin its rollout in Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, Paraguay, the Philippines, and the UK, with added support for Tagalog. Subsequently, the expansion will continue into countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Thailand, Tunisia, the UAE, Vietnam, and Yemen, incorporating languages like Arabic, Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese. Following the phased introduction, Meta AI is expected to be available in 43 countries and support a dozen languages. However, the latest expansion will not include the new character voices for the AI chatbot that company CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed at the company's annual Connect conference. These features are set to be released on a different schedule, according to the company. Additionally, Meta AI will soon be accessible on Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the UK and Australia, further extending the platform's reach and capabilities. The latest development comes after Meta Platforms introduced Movie Gen, an AI video generator capable of creating or editing videos from simple text prompts. This tool, which can generate videos up to 16 seconds long, is said to position Meta in direct competition with OpenAI and Google, as the race to develop advanced AI technologies intensifies. \"Meta AI chatbot expands to 21 additional markets\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.

The ads, which include TV, online and print, focus on domestic travelers, Airbnb Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson told Skift. (See two of the ads below.) “Historically, Airbnb has been much more about travelers from abroad coming into Japan, or Japanese travelers, maybe traveling abroad to the U.S. or France, or other places,” Stephenson said. “This is about Japanese travelers, traveling in Japan, which is the significant majority of the travel market in Japan.” Stephenson said Airbnb’s growth in Japan would take “many years.” “It takes time, it takes persistence,” he added. Airbnb sees international expansion as an important opportunity. In addition to Japan, Airbnb is targeting Mexico, China, and Brazil, among other markets. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky spoke about the challenges of breaking into some global markets on the company’s second-quarter earnings call. “So like in Korea and Japan, they prefer to do browsing than search. So we’ve had to retool our product. And that’s yielded some huge conversion rate increases.” And he noted the opportunity in Japan, in particular: “Japan is going to be a longer game, but that’s one of the biggest travel markets in the world.” Here are the two Japan ads, which deal with the variety of accommodation options, including seaside properties, available on Airbnb, and their suitability for families: Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.

Berkshire sold 9.5 million shares over three days at an average price of around $40. Buffett began shedding Bank of America stock in mid-July.  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) won't have to report its transactions in Bank of America (BAC) stock promptly anymore. That's because Buffett continued his recent selloff of Berkshire's holdings in the bank, and no longer has a 10% stake, the level required to give timely updates on investments. In a securities filing, Berkshire said it had sold about 9.5 million shares of BofA over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at an average price of approximately $40, netting some $380 million. Following the sale, Berkshire owns 775 million BofA shares. Berkshire began dumping the bank's stock in mid-July, and last month shed another 5.8 million shares. Asked about that then, BofA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Moynihan called Buffett \"a great shareholder,\" and explained that he didn't know why Buffett was selling, but wasn't worried. \"Life will go on,\" he added. The news didn't hurt Bank of America shares, which rose 5% Friday morning along with other bank stocks, and are up about 25% year-to-date. TradingView Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "WeightWatchers (WW) is trying to save its ailing business by betting on a market that threatens its very existence. The weight-loss company, previously championed by the likes of Oprah Winfrey, saw its stock spike this week after announcing that it will make copycats of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs. WW International (i.e. WeightWatchers) stock jumped nearly 40% Wednesday following the news, and the stock climbed an additional 23% Thursday to close at $1.96. WW is up 172% from last week. Though WeightWatchers’ core business is its dieting program, the company has attempted to get in on the booming weight-loss drug market dominated by pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). (The strategy was championed by its former CEO Sima Sistani, who recently departed the company.) WeightWatchers first attempted to secure a foothold in the weighty drug space early last year with its acquisition of Sequence, a telehealth platform specializing in weight-loss medication management. The acquisition has failed to improve the company’s revenue, which fell 14.5% in 2023 and is expected to decline another 13% this year. WeightWatchers’ announcement Tuesday that it will offer compounded GLP-1 drugs — which are cheaper and don't require insurance — is another shot at capitalizing on the market late in the game. Federal laws allow companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration’s shortage list. Regulations allow the drugs to be made at FDA-registered facilities, but the compounded medications themselves are not FDA-approved. WeightWatchers will offer a compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Here's the rub: Once the Novo Nordisk drugs are removed from the FDA’s shortage list, WeightWatchers will no longer be able to produce compounded semaglutide drugs at scale. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound, was removed from the list last week, posing a massive problem for companies making compounded versions of the drug. “Compounding is not a sustainable long-term business model,” Barclays (BARC.L) healthcare technology and distribution analyst Stephanie Davis told Yahoo Finance. Davis is one of four Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg. Half of those analysts have Equal Weight ratings on WW, and Davis is one of the other two analysts who recommend selling the stock. Meanwhile, WeightWatchers’ expansion in the weight-loss drug space contradicts its core business. “GLP-1s are going to cannibalize the diet industry,” Davis said.            ",

        "body": "By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Thursday as investors looked to higher-than-expected inflation and unemployment claims for indications on the health of the U.S. economy and the path for interest rates. The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% on a monthly basis in September and 2.4% on an annual basis, with both figures being slightly higher than estimated by economists polled by Reuters. The core figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.3% year-over-year, versus an estimate of 3.2%. In a separate report released on Thursday, jobless claims also rose to 258,000 for the week ending Oct. 5, versus an estimate of 230,000. \"Investors were torn between a stronger than expected CPI report and a weaker than expected unemployment claims report,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital in Chicago. \"One showed inflation running hotter than expected and the other showed the economy looking weaker than expected. It's the worst of both worlds.\" After the economic data, traders were pricing in a roughly 80% probability that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in November and a roughly 20% chance it would leave rates unchanged, according to CME's FedWatch. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic on Thursday said he would be \"totally comfortable\" skipping an interest-rate cut at an upcoming meeting of the U.S. central bank, adding that the \"choppiness\" in recent data on inflation and employment may warrant leaving rates on hold in November. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he sees \"gradual\" rate cuts over the next year-and-a-half, while the New York Fed's John Williams said he still sees rate reductions ahead. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 57.88 points, or 0.14%, to 42,454.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.99 points, or 0.21%, to 5,780.05 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 9.57 points, or 0.05%, to 18,282.05. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow had notched record closing highs in the previous day's session. Only three of the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors advanced on Thursday with energy, adding 0.8% and outperforming the rest as oil prices rose. [O/R] Oil futures rallied as U.S. fuel use spiked ahead of Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on Florida's west coast late on Wednesday. Oil prices are also being supported by supply concerns related to conflicts in the Middle East. Investors are also preparing for the third-quarter earnings season, with major banks scheduled to report results on Friday.        ",

        "body": "Despite once being declared “worthless,” the market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is showing early signs of recovery. Last week saw the highest weekly sales for digital collectibles since August, according to new data from NFT market tracker CryptoSlam. The organization said that weekly sales rose to $82.6 million in the past seven days, a major jump for NFT sales volumes. However, the data has limitations. Weekly reports on NFTs offer only a short timeframe of information and do not take into account seasonal factors that may influence sales. Given the high volatility in NFT markets, these reports are unlikely to reflect the long-term health of the market as a whole. Despite this, however, NFTs continue to draw eye-watering sums. Earlier this month, a user sold a CryptoPunk NFT for $56.3 million. Earlier this year, CryptoSlam reported a major plunge in NFT sales volumes, reporting a 45% decrease in NFT sales during the second quarter of the year. More recent data shows that August recorded the year's lowest NFT sales volumes, coming in at just $376.3 million, making the summer month the worst month of the year for sales. While the current upsurge in NFT sales pales in comparison to the volume recorded during the crypto market’s 2021-2022 bull run, some are speculating that NFTs are due for a resurgence. More than $26.5 million in NFT sales were recorded on the Ethereum blockchain network recently, and this week alone has seen over $5.5 million in sales, a figure that might only grow. "

The idea presumably is to provide ballast for her funds, which consist mostly of riskier stocks. Sometimes she’ll even buy when the stocks are rising, and that’s what she did Tuesday. Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter Investors and analysts are split in their views of Wood, possibly the country’s best-known investor after Warren Buffett. Boosters view her as a technology genius, while critics contend she’s just a mediocre money manager. Wood (Mama Cathie to her acolytes) soared to fame after a whopping return of 153% in 2020 and clear explanations of her investment strategy in frequent media appearances. Marco Bello/Getty Images But her longer-term performance won’t make you forget Buffett. Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $5.5 billion in assets, produced annualized returns of 15% for the past 12 months, negative 25% for the past three years and positive 3% for five years. That pales in comparison to the S&P 500. The index posted positive annualized returns of 35% for one year, 11% for three years, and 16% for five years. Wood’s investment philosophy is simple. Ark ETFs usually purchase emerging-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. Wood says companies in those categories are game changers. Of course, these stocks are often volatile, so Ark funds’ values can oscillate sharply. Renowned investment research firm Morningstar has launched strong criticism of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. Related: Cathie Wood sells two rocking tech stocks The potential of Wood’s five high-tech platforms listed above is “compelling,” Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote in a commentary. “But the firm’s ability to spot winners and manage their myriad risks is less so. ... It has not proved it is worth the risks it takes.” Morningstar portfolio strategist Amy Arnott calculated that Ark Innovation destroyed $7.1 billion of shareholder wealth from its 2014 inception through 2023. That put the ETF No. 3 on her wealth destruction list for mutual funds and ETFs over the past decade. Fraser Perring, a short-seller who founded Viceroy Research, unleashed a harsh assessment of Wood in 2022. “I wouldn’t even put your money with Cathie Wood,” he told New York magazine. “She is part of the problem. ... She’s a capital depleter. With the amount of capital she’s evaporated, how can people even suggest she’s successful? She’s successful at failing.”                  ",

Japan: Nikkei posts small rise as producer prices rise more than expected The Nikkei 225 hovered near breakeven, posting a minimal 0.26% rise with the financial sector leading the way, as traders awaited the release of U.S. before the bell in New York.

But some important industries are still feeling the aftershocks of the pandemic – despite undoubted recoveries. The cruise industry is one of these. While the overall hospitality and leisure sector is definitely enjoying better times, the world’s major cruise companies are showing idiosyncratic reactions as the vacation market normalizes – although it remains to be seen how the industry will absorb the shock of the recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the cruise lines are showing recent gains in earnings and revenues, and some are also showing powerful stock gains, while some are dealing with debt fallout from the pandemic. Assessing the current state of the industry, Citi analyst James Hardiman thinks the sector presents solid opportunities. “Our web traffic analysis points to September cruise traffic being among the best on record,” Hardiman recently noted. “Whereas Street narratives/multiplies see strong recent performance as a ‘catch-up trade’, our analysis and data suggest this growth has real legs into ‘25 and beyond.” Looking toward that long-term horizon, we’ve used the TipRanks Smart Score tool to locate two top-scoring cruise stocks – stocks that Hardiman feels deserve some closer investor attention. The Smart Score gathers and collates the voluminous market data on every stock, and uses it to rate the share in comparison to a set of factors that are known to predict outperformance. Both of these cruise stocks – Hardiman’s picks for the coming year – have also earned the Smart Score’s ‘Perfect 10’ rating. Let’s give them a closer look and find out exactly why the analyst and the AI algorithm agree that these are compelling buys. Carnival Corporation (CCL) First up, Carnival Cruise Corporation, a giant of the modern cruise industry with a 50-plus year history in the business. The company boasts a market cap of more than $25.5 billion, making it the second-largest cruise company plying the seas today. Carnival operates through its various brands, which include such famous cruise-industry names as Princess, Holland-America, and Cunard. Through these brands, Carnival Corporation sails a fleet of 95 modern cruise ships. Carnival’s brands are well-known, and respected for their modern equipment. The company is also known for its distinctive liveries – Carnival’s eponymous brand sails ships with funnels painted in a red-and-blue scheme, and shaped like a whale’s tale fluke, while Cunard, operating the famous liners Queen Mary 2 and Queen Elizabeth, is known for its black hulls and white superstructures. Passengers boarding a Carnival Corporation ship know what they are stepping aboard.                 ",

        "body": "Tempest Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:TPST) stock is trading higher on Thursday, with a strong session volume of over 23 million as per data from Benzinga Pro. The company entered into an agreement with Roche Holdings AG (OTC:RHHBY) to advance the evaluation of amezalpat (TPST-1120) in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and bevacizumab, the current standard of care for unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), into a Phase 3 trial for the first-line treatment of liver cancer. Under the agreement, Roche will supply atezolizumab globally and Tempest will sponsor and lead the pivotal study. This agreement builds on a clinical collaboration between the companies under which amezalpat was combined with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line HCC patients and compared to atezolizumab and bevacizumab alone in a randomized Phase 1b/2 study. Tempest retains all development and commercial rights to amezalpat. “Based on the positive Phase 2 data, I believe this combination therapy holds the potential to significantly improve first-line liver cancer treatment, and we look forward to amezalpat moving into this pivotal Phase 3 study,” said Stephen Brady, president and CEO of Tempest. In June, Tempest reported updated survival data from the ongoing global randomized Phase 1b/2 study, demonstrating a six-month improvement in median overall survival (OS) for patients receiving the combination therapy compared to the control arm of atezolizumab and bevacizumab alone. The survival benefit observed in the amezalpat arm was also maintained in key subpopulations. These June data build upon previously released data from the primary analysis showing that the amezalpat combination therapy provided clinical benefit regardless of PD-L1 status and in patients with both immune excluded and immune desert tumors. Patients with a mutation in the beta-catenin gene had an increased objective response rate, and a longer median OS was observed in the updated data set. Both were supported by amezalpat’s purported mechanism of action. The company is preparing for the Phase 3 study to start in the first quarter of 2025.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation The National Transmission Company South Africa, a state-owned business that will operate separately from parent Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., said this week it plans to spend 112 billion rand ($6.4 billion) on transmission capacity over the next five years. The NTCSA — which started up on Monday — said it’s considering building infrastructure itself or paying for developers to construct transmission lines and then taking them over, as well as “independent transmission projects” that may involve issuing concessions to private companies. While it hasn’t decided on funding models, at least some of the money would have to come from capital markets, according to Rand Merchant Bank. “Transmission infrastructure is capital-intensive and requires long-term funding,” Kate Rushton, a credit analyst at RMB, wrote in a report. “The debt market, including traditional providers such as banks, and the bond market will be important sources of debt financing.” A flood of new issuance for transmission lines and other infrastructure spending by state-owned companies may help revive the corporate bond market, where new issuance remains below the record levels seen before Covid-19 plunged the economy into contraction. Bond sales by companies reached 169 billion rand in 2019, before slumping in 2020. Issuance this year is at 116 billion rand, according to data compiled by Rand Merchant Bank, which expects borrowing to reach 131 billion rand by year-end. State-owned companies contributed just 15 billion rand. “There’s definitely scope for capital-raising in that market,” said Valdene Reddy, director of capital markets at JSE Ltd., which operates the country’s stock and bond markets. “The transmission company will be a good exercise, but there’s still a big piece of work in terms of restructuring that balance sheet. Getting that pipeline ready, even if it’s not a short-term initiative, but a medium-term initiative for listing equity or debt, will be quite healthy.” In an Oct. 9 review, Moody’s Ratings said Eskom would have to raise debt to finance network investments, but its ability to access markets on commercial terms — without new government guarantees — would depend on “significant improvement in its operations, debt collection, governance and regulatory arrangements.”                 "

        "body": "BofA Securities has upgraded Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), an energy infrastructure company that owns and controls oil and gas pipelines and terminals. The analyst notes stabilized base business. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter 2024 earnings on 16 October, with analysts estimating $0.27 for adjusted EPS and $3.95 billion for revenues. Amid uncertainty in the energy sector, the analyst recognizes the potential in companies with contracted natural gas pipelines. With increasing demand driven by Gulf Coast LNG projects and the electrification of utilities through AI, Kinder Morgan is positioned for long-term growth through its contracted business model. The strength of its natural gas pipeline business, which commands a higher valuation, balances out the declines seen in lower-valued CO and product pipelines. The analyst has upgraded from Neutral to Buy rating with a price target of $27, up from $23. Kinder Morgan has demonstrated its ability to supply gas to utilities, similar to Williams Companies Inc (NYSE:WMB), exemplified by the recent sanctioning of a $3 billion, 1.2 Bcf/d SNG pipeline expansion last quarter. Also Read: Hurricane Milton Evacuations ‘A Matter Of Life And Death,’ Biden Says: Fed’s Bostic Says Storm Could Have Significant Economic Impact Over Next 6 Months. BofA writes that the core business is now robust. Concerns that previously caused hesitation have been resolved, including the Supreme Court halted the Good Neighbor plan, which could have cost Kinder Morgan billions, the Double H pipeline, which represents the only significant contract roll of approximately $30 million in 2024, is transitioning to NGL service, effectively compensating for the prior contract, and recent acreage exchanges are revitalizing oil declines. Kinder Morgan currently accounts for 45% of LNG deliveries, and the analyst anticipates it will retain this market share. More importantly, the rise in power demand driven by electrification and AI is expected to contribute an additional conservative estimate of 4-5 Bcf/d of gas demand by 2030, particularly in regions served by Kinder Morgan pipelines.

This follows five consecutive months of decline, reflecting weak economic growth as domestic consumption continued to be held back by the ongoing property crisis in the country. Overall GDP growth slowed to 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024 from 5.3% in the first quarter. Retail sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), comprising electric mainly plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, jumped by 51% year-on-year to 1.12 million units in September, driven by stimulus measures introduced this year by the Chinese government. At the end of July the government doubled the one-off subsidy it introduced in April to CNY20,000 (US$2,800) for buyers trading in their old internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for qualifying new battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The government had previously also taken measures to push the struggling banking sector to reduce downpayment requirements on vehicle loans. In the first eight months of 2024 domestic retail sales of passenger vehicles increased by 2% to 15.5 million units, with NEV sales rising by 37% to 7.13 million units. \"China car market ticks up in September\" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "body": "A big jump in retail spending would be the next data point indicating a \"no landing\" of the economy. BofA analysts expect retail sales last month to soar 0.8%, above forecasts of 0.2%. A no-landing scenario occurs when strong economic growth fuels inflation and hinders rate cuts. America's spending habits are the next data point to monitor as Wall Street investors see rising odds of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy. Bank of America analysts expect September retail sales data, set for release on October 17, to show a 0.8% surge. Consensus estimates expect just 0.2% growth, according to economists polled by Bloomberg. The analysts say such a large jump in retail spending would likely increase the odds of a no-landing. That's a situation in which continued economic growth adds fuel to inflation and prevents the Federal Reserve from quickly cutting interest rates. While such an outcome points to a strong economy, it also could be bad news for people waiting for relief from higher borrowing costs. The analysts say that while monthly retail data can fluctuate, a big increase last month would be cause for concern. \"Monthly retail sales data can be volatile. But a report like the one we are forecasting would be significant,\" the analysts said in a Thursday note. They suggest that a strong report on the heels of \"very encouraging\" GDP and GDI revisions and a \"gangbusters\" September jobs report would only extend the slew of recent upside surprises that point to a hot economy. \"A month ago, the question was whether we are headed for a recession or a soft landing. If retail sales accelerate considerably, in our view, the narrative may shift further toward 'no landing' or even re-acceleration,\" they said. If the Fed has to pause its easing cycle amid high inflation, Americans will be left with higher prices and steeper borrowing costs. The analysts' outlook comes after last week's blockbuster September jobs report ignited speculation of a no-landing scenario. The report showed that the economy added 254,000 jobs in September, far above analyst estimates. Economic and income growth has also proved strong, with a set of revisions last month showing GDP grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter. The consumer price index, meanwhile, came in slightly higher than estimates on Thursday. The analysts acknowledge that last month's retail data might not be enough to force the Fed to stop its easing cycle, \"at least, not yet.\" They say the Fed will likely cut two to four more times even if the labor and economic activity remain strong.

A day after a California judge ruled the company has to open Android to third-party app stores, the Justice Department, in another case, said it may propose that the tech giant sell off a part of its business, like the Chrome browser or Android, to break up its search dominance. And how did Wall Street react to a potentially seismic event that could forever reshape the tech landscape? With a shrug — Google shares sank less than 2% Wednesday after the DOJ’s breakup recommendation. Part of the muted reaction has to do with the sluggish pace of legal proceedings. Even if judges rule against Google in every subsequent decision, the ultimate adverse outcome is still years away. But Wall Street also wagers that such a drastic decision would be so difficult to implement and so destructive in its consequences that a more modest remedy is likelier. Like separating conjoined twins, cutting off Google’s intertwined businesses poses immense challenges, and it almost seems hard to believe. And many still don't. “The street is looking at this and thinking despite all the scary headlines and noise that the chances of a breakup are minimal,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Investors are largely looking past Google’s legal troubles, cleaving instead to Mountain View’s vision for growth, powered by its cloud business, AI initiatives, and advertising empire. In a 32-page proposal, lawyers for the Justice Department outlined a framework of options for how the court should dismantle Google’s monopoly power in search. The potential remedies spanned from the harshest — breaking the company apart — to more limited plans, such as forcing Google into a data-sharing arrangement with rival search providers. But even as the most severe remedy is on the table, investors are still waiting for more guidance before making any big moves. In that reading, what may initially seem like denial reads pragmatic. “We think Google’s valuation at the moment largely discounts most of the associated regulatory risks but the market is looking for greater clarity on pending issues before bidding the stock in one direction over another,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Google’s year-to-date stock performance has lagged behind most of its Magnificent Seven peers, sitting in fifth place up about 15% and trailing the broader market’s gains of about 21%. So it may be that Wall Street has already priced in the regulatory risks. What’s more, an outcome that mandates Google change its business practices, rather than divest, could push the stock higher if investors see the ruling as a merciful punishment.         ",

This was the largest single-day jump of the past two years. What are the takeaways for transportation providers and managers in the wake of the third major transportation market disruption to hit in less than a month? Hurricanes can be the catalysts for dramatic shifts in North American transportation markets, traditionally making sourcing truckload capacity much more challenging. Shipping activity stalls for days, infrastructure like roads and warehouses are damaged, and then comes the disaster relief draw for carriers. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was the primary catalyst for one of the longest stretches of trucking market tightening of the past 20 years outside of COVID. In the days leading into a hurricane, carriers avoid driving into danger — as they should. Shippers may send out increased orders as they try to move their goods out of harm’s way. Inbound tender rejection rates for the Lakeland market in central Florida spiked to over 15%, the highest value since the pandemic era ended in early 2022. Outbound tender volumes also increased ahead of the storm, before dropping quickly as it made landfall. This type of activity creates bottlenecks in transportation shipping for a period of time after the storm passes. The national freight market has been a well-oiled machine since early 2022, as there has been more than enough trucking capacity to fill in the gaps when disruptions have occurred. Milton is the third major disruption to hit national transportation networks over the past three weeks. Hurricane Helene landed in the Big Bend area of the Florida Gulf Coast on Sept. 26 as a major Category 4 storm. The bulk of the damage occurred inland as the system quickly tracked into north Georgia and the western Carolinas. The storm caused catastrophic damage to the area but was not a major immediate disruption to transportation due to the lack of a major outbound shipping presence being impacted. The following week, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) went on strike for three days, resulting in several days of lost container clearing and shipping activity around the East Coast ports. While many shippers were prepared for this, some slight deterioration was detected in the form of slightly increasing rejection and spot rates.                "

Other data from the Labor Department on Thursday showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged last week to the highest level in more than a year, driven by Hurricane Helene and a nearly month-old strike at Boeing. The strike and hurricanes could cloud the labor market picture through the end of the year.

Morgan Wealth Management. \"Either way, inflation has been normalizing. As such, the evolution of the Fed's approach feels prudent.\" The consumer price index increased 0.2% last month after gaining 0.2% in August, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Food prices jumped 0.4% after rising 0.1% in August. Grocery store food prices increased 0.4%, lifted by higher costs for meat, poultry, fish and eggs. Fruits and vegetable prices rebounded 0.9% after dropping 0.2% in August. But consumers got some relief from gasoline prices, which plunged 4.1%. Rents increased 0.3% after climbing 0.4% in the prior month. In the 12 months through September, the CPI rose 2.4%. That was the smallest year-on-year increase since February 2021 and followed a 2.5% advance in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1% and rising 2.3% year-on-year. The annual increase in inflation has slowed from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Inflation is a major issue for voters in next month's presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's nominee, is locked in a tight race with the Republican Party's candidate Donald Trump. The Fed has mostly shifted focus to the labor market, delivering an unusually large 50 basis points rate cut in September. Minutes of that meeting published on Wednesday showed a \"substantial majority\" of policymakers supported starting an era of easier monetary policy with an outsized cut, but there appeared even broader agreement that the initial move would not commit the Fed to any particular pace of rate reductions in the future.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? New rules speeding up baseball make it more fun for fans, and women’s basketball is seeing a surge in viewers thanks to Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, he said Thursday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference. Boxing, Smith said, is one he would sell. “The promoters have ruined the sport,” Smith said. “They need somebody like (UFC chief) Dana White overseeing the sport. So you can give us the fights we want to see, when we want to see them, as opposed to dudes being able to avoid one another because they might get knocked out.” Golf is a sell, too, despite Tiger Woods’ success in what was historically an all-White sport. “There is nothing about golf that says to me, I’m invited, nothing,” said Smith, who is Black. “It costs a boatload of money to be a member of the club. You got to buy your golf clubs. It’s at a country club that, you know, the only time you really, really see Black folks, they’re working there.” Smith, 56, is one of the best known personalities on ESPN, serving as the featured commentator and executive producer of the weekday morning show First Take and as an analyst on NBA Countdown. He also hosts his own show on ESPN’s radio network. The network, which is owned by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., is suffering like other traditional TV companies as consumers cancel cable-TV subscriptions and shift to streaming services. As a result, ESPN has been in cost-cutting mode in recent years, with several high-profile personalities departing. Last month, one of the network’s highest-paid stars, NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, announced he was retiring. Smith has reportedly been looking for as much as $25 million annually in a new contract, twice what he’s currently making. He said he prefers to stay as ESPN and wants to reach a deal with the network. “And so now a negotiation takes place and hopefully the two sides can come to an accord,” he said. “And if we can’t, we can’t.

        "body": " Shares of Uber and Lyft jumped on Friday after Tesla's introduction to its new robotaxi failed to live up to ridesharing investors' fears. Analysts noted Tesla's much-anticipated event was light on details about the rollout of a ridesharing app that would compete with Uber or Lyft, lifting an uncertainty that has hung over the stocks for months. Uber shares hit an all-time high, while Tesla slumped further into negative territory for the year.  Shares of Uber Technologies (UBER) jumped to a record high on Friday after Tesla’s (TSLA) much-anticipated robotaxi launch event failed to live up to ridesharing investors' fears. Tesla on Thursday evening unveiled its CyberCab, an autonomous car designed for ridesharing, and a 20-seater \"RoboVan.\" CEO Elon Musk said the CyberCab would cost less than $30,000, and described a vision of individuals operating fleets of CyberCabs as an alternative to driving one car through either Uber or Lyft. Analysts were disappointed by the event, noting it was lighter on details than many Uber and Lyft investors had feared. Jefferies analysts in a note to clients called the CyberCab “toothless,” and said the event was a “best-case outcome for Uber.” Tesla, the analysts wrote, didn't \"provide verifiable evidence of progress\" on autonomous vehicles (AV), and that Uber was “uniquely positioned to support sustainable growth for AV developers.” Jefferies has a “buy” rating on Uber stock. Bank of America analysts noted that some risks remain, including the potential for RoboVans and CyberCabs to cost significantly less to operate than a conventional rideshare. However, Tesla gave “no specific business model” for a rideshare app that would compete with Uber or Lyft. They maintained their \"buy\" rating on Uber. Uber stock was up nearly 10% at $85.66, an all-time high, on Friday afternoon. Shares of competitor Lyft (LYFT) also jumped almost 10%. Tesla shares slumped, putting them down 12% since the start of the year. Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "US stocks were lower on Thursday after the latest consumer inflation print came in hotter than anticipated, further blurring the picture of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision in November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped around 0.1%, or just less than 60 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2% after both clinched fresh record highs on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was off less than 0.1%. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 1% as it eyed a rise to a record high, while e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) also rose roughly 1%, helping the Nasdaq pare earlier losses. In focus on Thursday was a reading on consumer inflation showing prices rose 0.2% last month, more than the 0.1% rise Wall Street was expecting. On an annualized basis, prices rose 2.4%, compared with 2.3% expected. The data was of greater interest than usual as investors puzzle over the chances of a \"no landing\" for the economy after last week's jobs report revived worries about inflation flaring up again. But the jobs market provided a surprise of its own on Thursday, as initial unemployment claims rose to 258,000, much more than Wall Street anticipated and the highest print since August 2023. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Amid all the moving parts, traders now see a 17% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Just a week ago, the odds of no cut were at 0% as the market heeded policymakers' message and prepared for a 25 basis point rate reduction. Also on deck is Tesla's (TSLA) highly anticipated robotaxi event on Thursday evening. CEO Elon Musk is expected to reveal a two-door, butterfly-wing prototype of the cybercab he has bet the EV maker's future on. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) added as much as 4 basis points on Thursday to hit 4.1% for the first time since late July. The 10-year has now added roughly 30 basis points over the past week as investors have scaled back their expectations for interest rate cuts amid signs that inflation may be stickier than initially thought while economic growth data holds steady. For much of the past few years, higher yields have been a headwind for stocks. But Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance on Thursday yields likely have risen enough to be too much of a headwind just yet. \"I don't think this backup in interest rates is all that worrisome for equities in aggregate,\" Kantrowitz said. \"But where it does show up is in leadership.\" Kantrowitz pointed out that areas like Real Estate (XLRE) and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT), which had benefited from investors anticipating lower rates, have lagged amid the 10-year yields recent rise. For now, Kantrowitz added, rising rates are driving market leadership more than it is weighing on the overall S&P 500 index. \"If rates keep going higher, I don't think it's a massive issue for equities unless it persists for, I'd say, a few months,\" he said. Weekly jobless claims soared to 258,000 in the week ending Oct. 5, the largest weekly gain since August 2023. The move higher from the prior week's reading of 225,000 was the largest week-over-week increase since July 2021. Economists were quick to point out that the ongoing strike from Boeing workers and the several hurricanes that hit different parts of the US over the past several weeks likely impacted the results. \"Claims rose markedly in some of the states most impacted by Hurricane Helene and the Boeing strike although some unimpacted states saw large increases as well,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"Claims will likely continue to be elevated in states affected by Helene, Hurricane Milton and the Boeing strike until its resolved.\" Even with some clear distortion from Hurricane Helene, Citi economist Gisela Hoxha wrote in a note to clients that states that weren't impacted by the hurricane also saw an increase. \"This suggests that the rise in initial claims is not just a temporary weather driven increase but could reflect some genuine economic weakness in other parts of the country,\" Hoxha wrote. On the surface, this would likely boost the case for a November interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which has made it clear it won't welcome further signs of labor market weakness. But Thursday also brought a hotter-than-expected inflation reading, which furthered the case for the Fed not to cut at all in November. Combine both pieces of data and the picture is rather mixed. There is perhaps one clear takeaway, though: Higher claims are likely going to be the norm heading into the Fed's next meeting. This means market participants will continue to debate whether the central bank will be willing to write off the increase as noise from weather-related job displacements or consider it a true sign of labor market deterioration. Tesla stock (TSLA) was nearly flat on Thursday as investors anxiously await the electric vehicle maker's “We, Robot” event, set to take place well after the closing bell on Wall Street. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: While most don’t expect a fully functional robotaxi that can be deployed right away, it’s what CEO Elon Musk and Tesla can do to paint a picture of autonomous self-driving that the company envisions for the next five or 10 years down the road that matters. Possible leaks have already surfaced suggesting Tesla may strike a robo-delivery deal with DoorDash, for instance. (Yahoo Finance could not verify those reports.) Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who named Tesla his “top pick” in the autos space, has nonetheless advised clients to “keep expectations well managed” for the event. What will most likely be on display is a demonstration of the latest iteration of FSD (full self-driving) software and a demonstration of a fully autonomous \"cybercab\" in a closed or semi-closed course, Jonas wrote last month. But in a more recent note last week, Jonas said investors may hear more about how those cybercabs, or robotaxis, will be deployed. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Columnist Kerry Hannon writes: The increase in Social Security benefits next year will be pocket-sized. The Social Security administration announced a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2025. That’s down from 3.2% this year but in line with the 2.6% average over the past two decades. Starting in January, the increase will add a little under $50 to the average monthly benefit of roughly $1,900, according to the SSA, providing some comfort to the more than 72 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who have grappled with higher prices in recent years. Read more here. Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic told the Wall Street Journal in an interview he'd be \"comfortable with skipping a meeting if the data suggests that’s appropriate.\" Additionally, Bostic told the Journal's Nick Timiraos that he only penciled in one additional interest rate cut for 2024 in his most recent submission to the Summary of Economic Projections. “So that already signals that I’m open to not moving at one of the last two meetings if the data comes in as I expect,” Bostic said. Bostic's commentary comes after a hotter-than-expected September jobs report and a reading on inflation for September, which showed price increases not cooling as fast as hoped, have fueled investor bets that the Fed may not reduce interest rates further at its November meeting. Traders now see a 15% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Just a week ago, the odds of no cut were at 0%. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose sharply last week, a new challenge for beleaguered house hunters and potential refinancing candidates. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan jumped to 6.32% for the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac, up from 6.12% a week earlier. It’s the biggest week-over-week increase since April. Read more here. WW International (WW), better known as WeightWatchers, surged more than 15% Thursday. The stock has gone on a furious rally this week following the company's announcement that it will offer a copycat of weight-loss drugs like those from Novo Nordisk (NVO). WeightWatchers shares were up 38% Wednesday, and the stock is up nearly 160% from last week but remains far from record highs around $100 in 2018. The company has struggled amid heightened competition in the weight loss space, an unsuccessful rebrand, and disruptions related to COVID-19. US laws permit companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the Food and Drug Administration's shortage list. The federal agency recently removed tirzepatide from the list, which is the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's (LLY) GLP-1 drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro. WeightWatchers will sell a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy. Oil gained as much as 2% on Thursday as traders assessed whether ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran will result in a supply disruption. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded above $74 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, jumped more than 2% to hover around $78 per barrel. \"Crude [is] continuing to find equilibrium value lifting prices today as uncertainty remains over when and where Israel will strike into Hezbollah and Iran,\" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading for BOK Financial Securities, said in a note on Thursday. Hurricane Milton's Florida landfall also kept the markets on edge. Production and refinery activity was not expected to be disrupted. However, analysts anticipated an interruption of distribution around the impacted areas as gas stations ran low on supplies. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: A warmer-than-expected inflation reading released Thursday offers new ammunition for Federal Reserve hawks who are arguing for a gradual pace of interest rate cuts. This report, according to some Fed watchers, is unlikely to change the path outlined by policymakers for smaller future cuts following an initial 50 basis point reduction in September. Investors, in fact, boosted the odds that the Fed will trim its policy rate by 25 basis points in November to 87% following the CPI release. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports: September's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came in hotter than analysts expected, but the data offered one major point of optimism: Shelter cost increases came down during the month, flashing an encouraging economic signal that the most stubborn contributor to inflation may finally be giving ground. \"The sharp reversal in shelter inflation allays fears that it could reaccelerate after the jump in August and brings the trend back toward the gradual disinflation that we continue to expect,\" said Parker Ross, global chief economist at Arch Capital Group Read more here. Falling gasoline prices were not enough to offset higher food and shelter prices in September, contributing to a hotter-than-expected inflation print. The gasoline index decreased 4.1% last month, compared to a decline of 0.6% in the prior month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. On an annualized basis, gasoline prices dropped 15.3%, while the energy index as a whole decreased 6.8%. Read more here. The major averages opened lower on Thursday after the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in hotter than expected, setting the expectation that the Federal Reserve will opt for a smaller rate cut at its meeting next month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (^DJI) fell nearly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed roughly 0.3%. Both slipped from their fresh record-high closes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped 0.5%. Technology (XLK) stocks led the declines, followed by Consumer Discretionary (XLY). On the flip side, Energy (XLE) stocks rose as oil jumped Thursday morning. Investors may be anticipating the Federal Reserve's next interest rate cut will be 25 basis points rather than 50 after inflation rose by 0.2% in September, more than the 0.1% rise Wall Street was expecting, according to the latest government data. Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported third quarter earnings that missed Wall Street's expectations Thursday morning, Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith reports. The miss sent its stock down as much as 7% in premarket trading before paring losses. Here's a look at its performance compared to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Delta said it forecasts earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.85 for the fourth quarter, with its $1.73 midpoint slightly below the $1.78 Wall Street analysts had expected, according to Bloomberg data. Delta CEO Ed Bastian blamed disruptions caused by a widespread CrowdStrike outage in mid-July. Issues with CrowdStrike's cybersecurity software, used by Delta, forced the airline to cancel thousands of flights and wiped $380 million from its revenue for the quarter, he said. “We had 86 great days and we had five days that were impacted, caused by CrowdStrike,” Bastian told Yahoo Finance. Read the full story here. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected last week in the latest sign that, while the labor market has shown some strength, there is still cooling in the jobs market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 258,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Oct. 5, up from 225,000 the week prior and above the 230,000 economists had expected. This marked the highest weekly unemployment claims since August 2023. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.86 million, up by 42,000 from the week prior. A closely watched report on US inflation showed consumer prices rose more than expected in September, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.4% over the prior year in September, an acceleration compared to August's 2.5% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase was higher than the 2.3% economists had expected. The index rose 0.2% over the previous month, above Wall Street's expectation for a 0.1% increase. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in September climbed 0.3% over the prior month and 2.4% over last year. Core prices rose 0.3% month over month and 3.2% on an annual basis in August. Both the monthly and yearly core readings were hotter than economists had projected. ",

All three gauges finished the first full trading week of October with weekly wins of more than 1%.

Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards At the same time, investors weighed the likely impact of a hot inflation print this week and unchanged wholesale inflation on Federal Reserve policy. The latest consumer inflation data failed to clearly signal the Fed's next move on interest rate cuts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose nearly 1% to notch a new record high on Friday, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% to close above 5,800 for the first time ever. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3% after closing out Thursday with small losses. Financials (XLF) outperformed on Friday, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) jumping after third quarter results came in better than expected. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks ended the session slightly lower, weighed by shares of EV giant Tesla (TSLA) following the reveal of a highly anticipated driverless robotaxi. Next week, earnings season continues in full swing, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) expected to report. On the cusp of another earnings season, it seems like quarterly results are far from the forefront of investors' minds, writes Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman. After a hot jobs report and a consumer inflation reading that didn’t put to bed concerns about rising prices, there’s more confusion than usual about what the Federal Reserve will do next with rates. Hopes for China stimulus and its ripple effect have sprung up, but the picture there remains murky as well, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in Chinese stocks. Throw in a couple of literal hurricanes and a figurative one in the Mideast, and investors have a lot to weigh when making decisions. “I think this earnings season is going to be pretty tricky,” Ohsung Kwon, US and Canada equity strategist at Bank of America, said in a recent interview. \"Now that the easing cycle has started, what are companies going to say about any early indications of improvement given the lower rate environment?” Wherever the forecasts land, “As long as companies have managed through macro headwinds and see early signs of improvement from lower rates, stocks should get rewarded,” Kwon wrote. Read the full story on investor challenges for the weeks ahead here. Boeing stock (BA) bounced up 2% from its its 52-week low on Friday as the plane maker took a tougher stance with its biggest union after a breakdown in negotiations this week left little hope of a quick resolution to an ongoing labor strike. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré reports that the plane maker on Thursday filed an unfair labor practice charge against representatives of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), claiming \"bad-faith bargaining.\" The move comes days after bargaining talks involving mediators broke down and Boeing withdrew its contract proposal on Tuesday. The labor strike is proving costly on several fronts for Boeing. The work stoppage has interrupted the company's recovery efforts to ramp up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets to 38 per month by the end of the year, up from roughly 25 per month in June and July. Earlier this week S&P Global placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the work stoppage continues until the end of the year. Riskier credit makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to borrow money. Read the full story on the implications for the ongoing strike here. The start of earnings season gave stocks a jolt Friday afternoon as big US banks impressed and offered positive momentum after a hot inflation print and unchanged wholesale inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained close to 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.2% after closing out Thursday with small losses. All three major gauges were set to score wins for the week, with the Dow up 0.9%, the S&P set to gain close to 1%, and the Nasdaq on course for 1% gain. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: BlackRock (BLK): The investment company rose 3% during afternoon trading on Friday after reporting third quarter earnings that surpassed investor expectations, propelling its stock higher. The investment giant posted record assets under management (AUM) for the quarter, reaching $11.5 trillion. Tesla (TSLA): Shares of the electric vehicle maker sank more than 8% Friday morning after CEO Elon Musk revealed the long-awaited driverless robotaxi on Thursday night, which left investors wanting more. The Cybercab features no steering wheels or pedals, and is designed to be fully autonomous. AO Smith (AOS): The maker of water heaters sank more than 5% after the company cut its earnings outlook for the fiscal year, which also dropped below analyst expectations. AO Smith also lowered its net sales forecasts Trump Media (DJT): Shares of the former president's media and tech company rose nearly 8% Friday morning, following an announced release of its Truth+ streaming app for Android devices on Thursday. The gains build on momentum from earlier in the week — its longest rally since June — as investors also assess Trump's standing in the presidential election. Shares of the ride-hailing company Uber (UBER) and its chief rival, Lyft (LYFT), both rose more than 10% Friday afternoon, with Uber reaching record levels as investors appeared unimpressed with Tesla's robotaxi unveiling. Tesla has envisioned a fleet of driverless taxis that users could summon on their phones, which could pose new competition to the app-based transportation platforms. But analysts critical of the demonstration said Musk failed to deliver key details on the self-driving taxi rollout, giving the transportation companies a boost. Jefferies analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets\" with “little evidence of feasibility.” On the other hand, more bullish analysts see an optimistic future for Tesla's ambitious plans. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said in a note on Friday that Tesla could ramp to 100,000 Cybercabs by 2027, with production possibly beginning in 2026. Investors pushed the stocks of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) higher Friday after third quarter results looked better than feared, a demonstration of resilience from the banking giants that points to the possibility of a soft landing for the US economy, reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. One JPMorgan executive was even willing to connect the bank’s performance to that soft landing, citing strength on the part of the lender’s consumer and corporate customers. An economy that achieves a soft landing is one where inflation slows without causing a recession. \"Broadly, I would say these earnings are consistent with the soft-landing narrative,\" the bank's CFO, Jeremy Barnum, told reporters. And the fact that companies are optimistic, he added, is \"pretty consistent with this kind of Goldilocks economic situation.\" The results kicked off a third quarter earnings season as lenders face questions about how a new Federal Reserve rate-cutting cycle will affect the biggest US banks over the next year. Read more here. The initial reaction on Wall Street to Tesla's robotaxi unveiling was underwhelming, sending the stock about 8% lower. But to the company's supporters, the event delivered on Musk's vision of pushing the electric vehicle maker to be more than merely a car company. Dan Ives, a vocal supporter of Musk's autonomous future, agreed with the skeptics asking for more details about Tesla's ambitious autonomous vision. But in a note on Friday, he said, \"We strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment as we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.\" Optimus is Tesla's humanoid robot, several of which walked into the event space on their own during the demonstration. Musk said the robots would likely cost between $20,000 and $30,000 when they eventually go on sale years from now — a claim he has made in the past. \"Optimus is going to become a bigger piece of the Tesla story and now there is no credit for this ground breaking robotic future in Tesla's current valuation,\" said Ives. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday: Tesla (TSLA): Shares of the electric vehicle maker sank more than 8% Friday morning after CEO Elon Musk revealed the long-awaited driverless robotaxi on Thursday night, which left investors wanting more. The Cybercab features no steering wheels or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous. JPMorgan (JPM): The financial services company rose almost 5% after reporting third quarter earnings that revealed a surprise gain in net interest income and raised its full-year forecast. Uber (UBER): Shares of the ride-hailing company and its chief rival, Lyft (LYFT), both rose more than 8% Friday, as investors appeared unimpressed with Tesla's robotaxi unveiling, which could pose new competition to the app-based transportation platforms. Trump Media (DJT): Shares of the former president's media and tech company rose nearly 8% Friday morning, following an announced release of its Truth+ streaming app for Android devices on Thursday. The gains build on momentum from earlier in the week — its longest rally since June — as investors also assess Trump's standing in the presidential election. US stocks traveled without strong direction Friday morning as the big US banks kicked off earnings season and investors considered how a hotter-than-expected inflation report and unchanged wholesale inflation would steer Federal Reserve policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.4% in morning trading, paring deeper premarket losses as big bank financial updates rolled in. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ticked over the flat line, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3% after closing out Thursday with small losses. All three major gauges were on track for wins for the week. Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), JPMorgan (JPM), and BNY Mellon (BK) stocks rose Friday morning as investors cheered the first wave of bank earnings. Wells Fargo jumped 5% after its earnings per share handily beat Wall Street's forecasts. Its adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 surpassed the analyst consensus of $1.25 per share, according to Bloomberg data. Still, the bank reported a drop in net interest income and its profit fell 11%. BNY Mellon and BlackRock also surpassed Wall Street's forecasts. BNY Mellon ticked up 0.5% after posting a 16% jump in profit. BlackRock rose 1.7% after reporting a record of $11.5 trillion in assets. JPMorgan (JPM) rose 3.5% as its Wall Street operations beat expectations, even though profits fell, Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports. Read the full story on what JPM's third quarter results say about the US economy here. Trump Media (DJT) stock jumped 11% premarket Friday before paring gains as the company continues its week-long rally. DJT was up 6% to $25.66 after the bell. Shares jumped 17% during Thursday's session following the company's launch of its Truth+ streaming app, which makes Trump Media TV programming available to Android users. The stock's climb extended gains earlier this week as investors responded to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's surprise appearance at a Trump rally over the weekend, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reported. DJT is beginning to recover after hitting its lowest level since the social media company went public last month. Shares remain far below highs above $70 reached in March. The stock has been volatile and likened to a meme stock, with investors responding to the ups and downs of the former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign. Read Alexandra Canal's recent coverage of the stock here. Over a piece of braised short rib at the NYC Marriott Marquis last night, I got to sit among some amazing business news journalists at the annual Knight-Bagehot dinner and listen to a 20-minute chat between journalist Alan Murray and billionaire financier at Citadel, Ken Griffin. A lot of us in the room thought it was weird to see Griffin do the keynote fireside chat. A billionaire who got pulled through the mud during the meme stock craze waxing poetic about how reading Wall Street Journal articles about KKR's Henry Kravis when he was a teen inspired him to become a hedge fund king? The eye rolls were plentiful in the room. However, Griffin did give us journos some red meat at the end of the conversation. “I know who I am voting for, and it won’t be with a smile on my face,” Griffin said. I suppose that means Harris, but who knows! Reuters has the details, and Kathy Jones at the Schwab Center for Financial Research has some quick analysis: Tesla stock (TSLA) sank 6% premarket Friday as investors reacted to the EV maker's robotaxi unveiling. Elon Musk has lofty ideas about the future of Tesla's self-driving vehicles, and the recent event tested Wall Street's appetite for that vision. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports that the \"We, Robot\" event left investors wanting more. Musk unveiled a $30,000 autonomous \"Cybercab,\" arriving sometime in 2026. Tesla did not reveal its upcoming lower-cost “next-gen” model, which many analysts had expected, Subramanian reported. The sub-$30K next-gen EV will arrive later this year, Tesla has previously confirmed. Tesla stock has been on a wild ride recently, rising on prior hopes for the robotaxi unveiling before falling after the company's third quarter deliveries disappointed. Tesla shares are down 8% from last year. Uber stock (UBER), meanwhile, rose 5% in premarket trading. Read the full story on Tesla's robotaxi debut here. DETROIT (Reuters) — Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) confirmed on Thursday that CEO Carlos Tavares would retire at the end of his contract in early 2026 and announced major senior management changes as it struggles to turn around its lagging North American operations. Reasonable quarter out of JPMorgan (JPM) this morning. Read more from our banking reporter David Hollerith. I hopped on JPM's earnings media call and asked CFO Jeremy Barnum his views on housing post Fed rate cut. All in all, it didn't sound like a housing boom was taking shape with lower rates — but activity has picked up. Here's what Barnum told me (emphasis ours): “What we did see, as you kind of would expect, is a pickup in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of increase in refinancings there, which, again, you would also expect. But it's worth noting, when it comes to mortgages, that all of the sequential and year-on-year changes are coming off a very low base, and it remains the case that the vast majority of the stock of outstanding mortgages right now in this country are below 6% with a lot of them still even below 5%. So it would take a really big rally in the long end of the yield curve to see a significant pickup in refinancing. The house view on home prices, you know, I think generally you've got a tension there between possibly a slightly weakening economy that should create a little bit more supply, there's a little bit more construction, but there's generally a housing shortage in this country. So the housing market seems to me is still a little bit stuck, I would say.” ",

        "body": "Celero Commerce, the payments company backed by LLR Partners, is up for sale and has hired an investment bank to advise on the process, according to four banking and private equity executives. The execs predict the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company could sell for roughly $600 million, or 12 times Celero’s trailing Ebitda of $50 million. Celero is in the “back half’ of a process that has attracted private equity, they said. LLR, a lower middle market PE firm, formed Celero in late 2018 when it invested in UMS Banking, a merchant acquirer. Celero has remained very acquisitive, buying about 10 companies since then, including RazorSync in 2019, TransNational Payments in 2020, and this past August, it scooped up SONA. LLR and Celero did not return messages for comment. News of the Celero sale comes as mergers remain slow. The number of U.S. announced transactions so far this year has dropped about 8% to 7,993, totaling $1.2 trillion as of Oct. 7, according to data from Dealogic. That figure represents a 17% jump in value compared to 2023 when 8,660 mergers totaled $1 trillion, according to Dealogic. While there are lots of discussions going on, sales are harder to get done this year, one fintech banker said. Mergers typically slow down ahead of the U.S. presidential election with many expecting deals to return next year. “Buyers aren’t ready to spend on these M&A situations as easily as they used to in the past. That’s the issue,” one banker said. In another fintech development, Finexio, the payments startup backed by JPMorgan, is seeking a minority round of capital, according to three banking sources. Finexio has hired an investment bank to advise on the fundraise, they said. In 2015, Ernest Rolfson, a former Mastercard executive, founded Finexio, which seeks to simplify the accounts payable process for medium and large companies. The company provides software that converts paper checks to electronic payments. Finexio has introduced a Card by Mail product which seeks to blend the comfort of paper checks with the efficiency of digital payments, according to an April blog post. Despite the shift to digital, some businesses continue to use legacy payment methods. About 75% of organizations use paper checks despite the high costs, according to a study from PYMNTS Intelligence. Finexio has raised about $83.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. JPMorgan, an active fintech acquirer, was the largest investor of Finexio’s $35 million B round that it raised in October 2022. Discover Financial Services and Valley Bank also took part. The B round valued Finexio at $100 million. (Capital One’s more than $35 billion buy of Discover is expected to close later this year or early 2025.)   "

The world's largest bank by market cap posted revenue of $42.65 billion, well above the $39.87 billion it reported a year ago and the $40.85 billion consensus estimate of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha. Reported net interest income (NII) rose to $23.41 billion from $22.73 billion. Profit fell slightly to $12.9 billion from $13.15 billion, but edged higher to $4.37 from $4.33 on a per-share basis. Analysts were expecting $11.81 billion, or $3.97 per share. JPMorgan shares, which had risen about 25% this year through Thursday's close, were up just under 2% in premarket trading after the report's release. Higher interest rates in recent years helped JPMorgan and other banks reach record levels of net interest income, but rising deposit costs have impacted bank earnings in recent quarters while loan growth has stalled. JPMorgan and other banks are reporting earnings amid a shifting economic environment, as the Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the first time since 2020. Analysts expect that the newly lowered rates and potential for future cuts should help lower deposit costs and spark more investment banking and loan growth in the coming quarters. Analyst and investor attention has also focused recently on how JPMorgan will form a succession plan for 68-year-old Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jamie Dimon. The influential executive has said in recent months that the bank wants to make sure it gets the plan right when he steps away in the coming years. Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 26 cents per share ($1.04 a year). To earn $500 monthly from the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm, start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Bank of America's $1.04 dividend: $6,000 / $1.04 = 5,769 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $230,587 worth of Bank of America, or 5,769 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares, or $46,125 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). View more earnings on BAC Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. Price Action: Shares of Bank of America fell by 0.6% to close at $39.97 on Thursday. The firm will release earnings results for its third quarter before the opening bell on Tuesday, Oct. 15, Analysts expect Bank of America to report quarterly earnings at 77 cents per share.

Here’s where and when to see them Candy and snack recall, FDA update: List of products that may be contaminated with salmonella After hitting a 16-month low of 6.11% in early September, the average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate tracked by Mortgage News Daily has ticked back up, reaching 6.62% on Tuesday. That increase will likely dampen some of the refinancing activity, which had started to gain a bit of momentum as some borrowers with 7% and 8% mortgage rates took the opportunity to get some relief. According to a new survey by John Burns Research and Consulting (JBREC), neither the 6.11% rate nor today’s 6.62% was going to do too much to motivate homeowners who would like to sell but are staying put because of mortgage rates. At what mortgage rate level would resale turnover—currently hovering at multi-decade lows—really pick up? The “magic mortgage rate” that JBREC says would truly unlock the housing market is below 5.5%. The research firm has held this view for a while and reaffirmed it last week, citing its September 2024 survey. Only 13% of homeowners surveyed by JBREC said they would accept a mortgage rate between 6.5% and 6.99% on their next home. But 47% said they would accept a mortgage rate between 5.0% and 5.5%. Why have mortgage rates bounced up over the past week? The latest employment reports have come in a bit warmer than expected, with the U.S. unemployment rate falling from 4.3% in July 2024 to 4.1% in September 2024. After rising from the cycle low of 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.3% in July 2024, some analysts were concerned this could signal a sharp labor market slowdown or recession. However, the latest jobs numbers have eased those fears somewhat and placed a little upward pressure on long-term yields, including mortgage rates.

The U.S. producer price index for final demand was unchanged in September, slightly below the forecast of economists polled by Reuters for a gain of 0.1%. It followed an unrevised 0.2% increase in August, indicating inflation continues to cool and giving the Fed leeway to continue cutting interest rates. In the 12 months through September, the PPI increased 1.8% versus the 1.6% estimate. On Thursday, the consumer price index turned out to be slightly higher than expected as goods costs increased. The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 68.9 this month, compared with a final reading of 70.1 in September and below the 70.8 estimate as high prices discouraged shopping. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks advanced, with the Dow and S&P 500 closing at record highs, as bank shares jumped 4.21%, its biggest daily percentage gain since May 2023, at the start of the quarterly earnings season. JP Morgan rose 4.44% and Wells Fargo shot up 5.61%. \"As we get to the latter part of this year and into next year, you're going to see earnings growth in the broader market and not just a small group of stocks and what the banks are telling us today is that's happening,\" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Amundi U.S. in Boston. \"Banks have been as big a question mark as anybody - the level of rates, the yield curve, capital markets activity, et cetera - and two of our biggest banks today are saying well everything's going to be pretty good.\" S&P 500 earnings growth is expected to be 4.9%, LSEG data showed, down slightly from 5.2% at the start of October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 409.74 points, or 0.97%, to 42,863.86, the S&P 500 rose 34.98 points, or 0.61%, to 5,815.03 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 60.89 points, or 0.33%, to 18,342.94. Gains were capped, however, by an 8.78% tumble in Tesla shares as the electric vehicle maker promised much at its robotaxi event with few practical details. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 4.56 points, or 0.54%, to 852.75 and was on track for its fourth weekly gain in five weeks. In Europe, the STOXX 600 index closed up 0.55% as investors shifted their focus to China's fiscal stimulus, corporate earnings seasons and the European Central Bank's (ECB) expected rate cut next week.

        "body": "Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 7% Friday midday as investors signaled disappointment over the EV maker’s robotaxi debut. Following the event on Thursday night, “We, Robot” — which aimed to cement CEO Elon Musk’s position as an AI leader — investors and analysts came away with more skepticism than excitement over Tesla’s lofty vision for a future of driverless cabs. Jefferies (JEF) analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets\" with “little evidence of feasibility.” “We believe TSLA potentially underappreciates the obstacles to scaling a robotaxi fleet,” they wrote. Tesla’s new Cybercab has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous, Yahoo Finance’s Pras Subramanian reported. The company said it will begin unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) trials with Model 3 and Model Y test vehicles next year in Texas and California. Tesla is aiming to begin Cybercab production “before 2027,” Musk said. Tesla’s stock drop on Friday extended a two-week decline. TSLA shares fell last week after the company missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. The stock — which has experienced far more volatility over the past year than its Magnificent Seven peers — is down 17% from last year. Still, TSLA’s Friday price of $220 per share is far higher than lows below $140 this spring. Shares hit a 15-month low in April amid Tesla’s layoffs and price cuts. Investors and analysts had hoped the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event would live up to the hype but were disappointed by Musk’s lack of clarity over how the company would achieve its ambitious goals. Raymond James (RJF) analyst Josh Beck called Tesla’s plan to commercialize its Cybercabs “vague” and “underwhelming.” Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts said the event included a “disappointing lack of detail” about updates to Tesla's FSD technology and market strategy. RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan concurred, writing in a note Friday that investors believe Musk’s vision “was light of real numbers and timelines.” “These typically come at Tesla events,” he added. “This one seemed focused on branding and marketing Tesla's vision, rather than giving concrete numbers for us to model out.” Additionally, Tesla did not reveal details about a lower-priced vehicle as some investors had hoped. That vehicle is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, analysts noted. To be sure, some experts on Wall Street think “We, Robot” was a success. Bank of America analysts said the robotaxi event “lived up to the hype.”           ",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The way Jeff deGraaf sees it, hedge funds that sold a record amount of Chinese shares earlier this week toward the end of the CSI 300’s 10-day, 35% surge are in for a world of regret. Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? In fact, says the co-founder and chief executive officer of Renaissance Macro Research, rarely in his more than three-decade Wall Street career have the stars aligned so perfectly for a lengthy rally. “Skepticism, valuation, stimulus, momentum and a trend change,” they’re all there, he said in an interview. It’s because of that backdrop that the Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch veteran is now one of the biggest China bulls on Wall Street. He predicts the country’s benchmark gauge will hit 6,000 in the next 12 months, a more than 50% advance. DeGraaf, who ranked as the top technical analyst in Institutional Investor’s annual survey for 11 straight years through 2015, says that it’s no coincidence that Beijing rolled out its most aggressive monetary easing in years as equities tested their year-to-date lows last month. “Markets drive policy as much as policy drives markets,” he said. His forecast compares with Morgan Stanley’s newly revised CSI 300 target of 4,000 by June 2025, implying virtually no upside from Thursday’s close. The index plunged 7.1% on Wednesday, the second day mainland markets reopened after the Golden Week holidays. While it rose 1% Thursday, enthusiasm over a stimulus-driven equity surge is cooling due to the lack of any further major initiatives at a key policy meeting earlier this week. DeGraaf recommends investors “keep stops in place and don’t get dogmatic” when wagering on China. For now, traders are awaiting the outcome of a finance ministry briefing on fiscal policy due Saturday. “We see the policy response as self-preservation, a reaction to the weakness and a potential Mario Draghi-esque ‘Do what it takes’ moment for China,” deGraaf said. The former Lehman chief technical analyst also downplayed potential risks to Chinese shares from the upcoming US presidential election. It’s a “side show, probably doesn’t matter much, and a reaction would be an opportunity,” he said.

        "body": "Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) will release earnings results for its third quarter before the opening bell on Friday, Oct. 11. Analysts expect the San Francisco-based bank to report quarterly earnings at $1.28 per share, down from $1.48 per share in the year-ago period. Wells Fargo projects to report revenue of $20.41 billion for the recent quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Some Wells Fargo investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Wells Fargo currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.78%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share ($1.60 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Wells Fargo, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Wells Fargo's $1.60 dividend: $6,000 / $1.60 = 3,750 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $215,775 worth of Wells Fargo, or 3,750 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.60 = 750 shares, or $43,155 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. View more earnings on WFC The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.  Price Action: Shares of Wells Fargo gained by 0.4% to close at $57.54 on Wednesday. On Oct. 8, Wolfe Research analyst Steven Chubak upgraded Wells Fargo from Peer Perform to Outperform and announced a $65 price target.

        "body": "By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -The S&P 500 and the Dow scored record closing highs on Friday, with the big boosts from financial stocks after banks reported strong quarterly results while the latest inflation data fueled expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut in November. Major financial companies kicked off earnings season with JPMorgan Chase finishing the session up 4.4% after the lender reported higher-than-expected third-quarter profit and raised its annual interest income forecast. Shares in Wells Fargo rallied 5.6% after its profit also beat analysts' expectations. BlackRock stock gained 3.6% after the asset manager reported that its assets under management had hit a record high for the third straight quarter. Other stocks in the industry rose broadly, making the S&P 500 Financials index the biggest index points boost for the benchmark. \"We'd some good earnings reports from some leading financial companies. That's a good start to earnings season,\" said Evan Brown, Portfolio Manager and Head of Multi-Asset Strategy, UBS Asset Management, adding that it bodes well for the economy. \"When financials do well, this is what a soft landing looks like. It's a positive overall sign for the economy and sets a positive tone for earnings releases in other industries in the next few weeks.\" For the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 409.74 points, or 0.97%, to 42,863.86, the S&P 500 gained 34.98 points, or 0.61%, to 5,815.03 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 60.89 points, or 0.33%, to 18,342.94. For the week, the S&P 500 added 1.1% while the Dow climbed 1.2% and the Nasdaq added 1.1% with all three notching their fifth weekly gain in a row. Earlier in the day, data from the U.S. Department of Labor showed the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand was unchanged on a monthly basis in September, compared to the 0.1% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters. Friday's PPI data follows Thursday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, which was slightly higher than forecast, although weekly jobless claims rose more than expected. \"The market's pretty convinced that we're going to have a soft landing and that inflation, even with CPI being a little bit higher than expected yesterday, is going to be moderate,\" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. \"If you look at today's PPI data, the core and final demand were both a little lower than expected ... Inflation's certainly been moderating and that's a positive that the market paid attention to.\"         ",

        "body": "The stock market has been on a tear in 2024, with the S&P 500 rising by nearly 21 percent over the first three quarters of the year. But the situation may not be so brisk over the coming 12 months, say analysts in Bankrate’s Third-Quarter Market Mavens Survey. These pros expect the market to rise just 4.1 percent over the coming four quarters, below its long-term annual average of 10 percent. The survey’s respondents see the S&P 500 climbing from 5,738 at the end of the survey period to 5,975 by the end of the third quarter of 2025. It’s the 16th straight survey where the analysts have projected a gain in the year ahead. The analysts also preferred U.S. stocks over international ones, and they think value stocks will outperform growth stocks over a similar time frame. “Reflecting multiple sources of uncertainty, there are some reasons to be cautious about the outlook,” says Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst. “Even so, the resilience of the U.S. economy and the stock market’s ability to power through multiple threats taken together have been nothing short of remarkable.” Here are the highlights from Bankrate’s quarterly Market Mavens Survey. This article is one in a series discussing the results of Bankrate’s Third-Quarter 2024 Market Mavens Survey: Survey: Market strategists see 10-year Treasury yield at 3.5% a year from now Best moves for long-term investors with stocks near all-time highs, according to market experts Stock market outlook for the next 12 months: Here’s what top analysts are predicting into 2025 The S&P 500 has had a really strong run since the start of 2023, and while it’s definitely had some hiccups in 2024, this year has been notably strong, too. But the market pros surveyed by Bankrate expected more muted returns over the next 12 months. The average estimate for the S&P 500 is 5,975 for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2025 — up 4.1 percent from 5,738 at the end of the recent survey period on Sept. 27, 2024. In the second-quarter survey, analysts estimated a similar 4 percent gain in the year ahead. “The major averages have fared remarkably well even when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates to the highest levels in years,” says Hamrick. “Now that the central bank has begun an easing cycle, the notion ‘don’t fight the Fed’ should provide some reassurance. At the same time, the Fed’s mandate has nothing to do with preserving stock market gains or momentum.” “It looks like the Fed can avoid recession, but it’s much too early to have great conviction,” says Michael K. Farr, president and CEO, Farr, Miller & Washington.                                       "

The company also announced updated Phase 1b data on ACTengine IMA203 TCR-T targeting PRAME in melanoma patients and provided an update on SUPRAME, the upcoming Phase 3 trial to evaluate IMA203 in metastatic melanoma patients. As of August 23, 2024, 28 heavily pretreated patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with IMA203 at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D, 1 to 10 billion total TCR-T cells) during the Phase 1b dose expansion part of the clinical trial. IMA203 monotherapy has maintained a favorable tolerability profile with no treatment-related Grade 5 adverse events in the safety population, even at doses up to ~10×10 power 9 TCR-T cells. The data presented demonstrate a significant positive shift in median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) between melanoma patients treated during Phase 1a and patients treated in Phase 1b. In addition, approximately half of all patients in the Phase 1b trial have a deep response (>50% tumor reduction). This subgroup of patients was observed to have a median PFS of more than one year, while patients with <50% tumor reduction (including patients with tumor size increase) were still observed with a more than 2 times longer median PFS compared to patients treated in dose escalation with suboptimal doses. Translational data from patients across Phase 1a and Phase 1b indicate that IMA203 T cells rapidly engrafted in all patients after a single dose and show a persistence of more than two years. The Phase 3 trial will evaluate IMA203 targeting PRAME in 360 HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with second-line or later unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The Phase 3 trial is on track to commence in December 2024 and patient enrollment is forecasted to be completed in 2026. A pre-specified interim analysis is planned for early 2026. The company aims to submit an FDA marketing application in early 2027 for full approval. Price Action: IMTX stock is down 11.1% at $9.841 at last check Thursday.

        "body": "We talk about the digital economy, or the consumer economy, and even sometimes about the manufacturing sector – but the truth is, these are all interrelated and cannot be fully atomized. The glue that holds them together is the transport sector, the unsung transportation companies that move people and goods wherever they are wanted and needed. This is big business. According to Mordor Intelligence, the US freight and logistics sector will total more than $1.33 trillion this year, and reach $1.67 trillion by the end of the decade. While freight and transportation stocks are vulnerable to cyclical changes and headwinds – demand can be fickle, consumer desires can change – there is always a need for freight and transport services. Indeed, Citi analyst Ari Rosa is telling investors that the transport sector is primed for gains going forward, writing in a recent note: “We believe select Transportation and Logistics stocks are well-positioned to deliver strong relative outperformance in the year ahead. This view is supported by our analysis that suggests the cyclical downturn in transports is in its late stages, with rates and margins near trough, offering the prospect of strong earnings growth in 2025 and into 2026 as rates recover…” “In our view,” adds Rosa, “investors should be positioned for a cyclical recovery, with attractive opportunities in companies that are leveraged to realize outsized benefits as freight conditions tighten.” With this outlook in mind, Rosa has pinpointed two top transportation stocks for investors to keep an eye on. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve taken a deeper dive to assess whether these picks truly hold up. JB Hunt (JBHT) First on the list is JB Hunt, the $16.8 billion trucking and logistics firm founded in Arkansas back in 1961. Today, JB Hunt is the 12th largest transport company, of any type, in the US – and one of the five largest trucking companies. The company has brought a 21st-century business approach to the trucking sector, investing heavily in its people, its technology, and its transport capacity to build out North America’s most efficient transport network. JB Hunt offers a wide range of trucking and transport services, including intermodal freight, moving containers from rail to truck and truck to rail; dedicated trucking, offering contract fleet services to enterprise customers; full truckload and less-than-truckload shipping and contract shipping services; and even ‘last mile’ delivery. These are the mainstays of the trucking sector, making freight delivery scalable, flexible, and timely – and JB Hunt has proven expertise at all of them.                ",

The jobs report dashed hopes of another jumbo 50-basis point cut, but the slight upside surprise in CPI likely isn't enough to prompt a complete pause on Fed easing. \"There is only one more set of inflation reports between now and then, and even a firm upside surprise could be discounted as normal monthly volatility on the path back toward the 2% target,\" JPMorgan analysts said in a Friday note after the jobs report. Investors now see a 25-basis point rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month more likely compared to leaving rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Weekly jobless claims, meanwhile, climbed 33,000 to 258,000, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That surpassed forecasts of 230,000 and marks the data point's highest level in over a year. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: S&P 500: 5,774.06, down 0.32% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 42,429.01, down 0.2% (-82.99 points) Nasdaq composite: 18,218.14, down 0.41% Here's what else was going on Thursday: FEMA was strapped for cash even before Hurricanes Helene and Milton blew through the South.

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose to records Friday as big banks rallied following a run of reassuring profit reports. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to top its all-time high set earlier in the week and close out its fifth straight winning week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 409 points, or 1%, to set its own record. The Nasdaq composite lagged the market with a gain of 0.3% after a slide for Tesla kept it in check. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other things. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. It was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500. CEO Jamie Dimon said the nation’s largest bank is also still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, but the pace is modest “given that market levels are at least slightly inflated.” BlackRock, meanwhile, rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 8.8% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the “Cybercab,” potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.98 points to 5,815.03. The Dow rallied 409.74 to 42,863.86, and the Nasdaq composite gained 60.89 to 18,342.94. Another automaker, Stellantis, saw its European-traded shares sink 2.8% after it announced some significant leadership changes, including the timing of CEO Carlos Tavares’ retirement. Its chief financial officer is also departing as the company formed by the merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler struggles to revive sales in North America. In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed following the latest updates on inflation at the wholesale level and on sentiment among U.S. consumers. Prices paid by producers were 1.8% higher in September than a year earlier. That was an improvement from August’s year-over-year inflation level, but not as much as economists expected. Analysts said it likely helped calm worries stirred a day earlier, when a report showed inflation at the consumer level wasn’t cooling as quickly as economists expected.           ",

        "body": "Second-quarter earnings at supply chain software provider E2open were negative enough that investors heavily sold off stock Thursday after management tried to put a positive spin on the company’s outlook. At approximately 11:15 a.m. EDT,  E2open (NYSE: ETWO) stock was down about 75 cents per share to $3.32, a drop of 18.4%. It was not a 52-week low for the company; that mark was set with a price of $2.15 almost one year ago exactly at the time it was pushing its CEO out the door. Among the key numbers that investors may have found discouraging was subscription revenue of $131.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. However, that figure was not surprising and actually came toward the high end of the guidance range of $129 million to $132 million that had been provided by the company. But it appears to be the company’s guidance going forward that set off the drop in E2open’s stock price. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, subscription revenue is expected to be $130 million to $133 million. CFO Marj Armstrong said on the conference call with analysts that the figure would represent a drop of 2.1% on the low end from the prior year to an increase of 0.2% on the high end. But she also said E2open expects to have higher “booking and customer retention metrics” in the third quarter sequentially from the second quarter. For all of fiscal 2025, E2open now expects its subscription revenue to be $526 million to $532 million, which would be a negative 2% to negative 1% growth rate. Total revenue for the  company would be $607 million to $616 million, which would be a negative 4% to negative 3% rate compared to the prior year. The continuing weak fiscal performance at E2open comes several months after it announced it was launching a “strategic review” of its future. That announcement in March followed activist investor Elliott Management’s disclosure a few days after that 52-week low a year ago that it had taken a greater-than-13% stake in the company through outright equity ownership and an options position. On the earnings call, CEO Andrew Appel, who has been in the seat since February, said that review was “ongoing.” “Our directors are committed to a careful and thorough evaluation of the options we have available to us,” he said, adding that he would not comment further on the review. The lagging performance of E2open led to the dismissal of Appel’s predecessor, Michael Farlekas, a year ago about the time that 52-week low was reached. Appel was named interim CEO at that time – he had been a director – before being made permanent CEO in February.                 "

The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts The People’s Bank of China will accept applications from eligible securities firms, funds and insurers starting Thursday to obtain highly liquid assets such as government bonds and central bank bills if they provide certain collateral. The size of the tool is 500 billion yuan ($70.6 billion) and can be expanded in the future, the monetary authority said in a statement. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng unveiled the mechanism as part of a stimulus bonanza last month that signaled the government’s intent to draw a line under the slowing economy. The moves fueled a world-beating rally that saw shares rise as much as 30%. The funds obtained through the facility can only go toward investment in the stock market, Pan said at the time. Bonds, stock ETFs, CSI 300 constituent shares and other assets could be used as collateral, the PBOC said Thursday. The latest announcement comes as the stock rally cools on the lack of immediate fiscal stimulus following a weeklong national holiday. Investors are now awaiting a press briefing by Finance Minister Lan Fo’an on Saturday to watch for clues of any steps to boost government borrowing and spending to shore up growth. The CSI 300 Index rebounded on Thursday from a heavy selloff the previous day. It finished up 1.1% at the close, after gyrating between gains and losses earlier. Insurers are likely to be the first to apply for the liquidity tool, partly because their equity holdings match the collateral requirements made by the PBOC, according to Wu Xuan, fund manager at Borui Funds Management. Regulators see insurance funds as a key source of long-term investment into the market, he said. “They are shouldering more of a ‘political task,’” said Wu. “I would expect more details over the coming weeks and the first batch using the tool within two-three months.” Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., said the policy is expected to support the market, although she wouldn’t link the timing to the performance of stocks.

September's producer price index was flat, calming inflation concerns amid rising yields. US stocks jumped on Friday, with all three major averages notching a five-week win streak. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs on Friday. The session marked the S&P 500's 45th record closing high this year and the first time the benchmark index climbed above 5,800. The gains came after US mega-banks JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reported upbeat third-quarter results that showed no signs of an imminent consumer slowdown. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release but warned that geopolitical conditions are \"treacherous and getting worse.\" Dimon has long warned investors about rising geopolitical risks. Also helping stocks on Friday was a light print for September's wholesale inflation gauge. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. The cool PPI report came a day after the CPI report was slightly hotter than expected. \"CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk's EV company has returned to being the most shorted stock in the United States. Weakening fundamentals and discounting measures top the list of analyst concerns.  Tesla (TSLA) bulls have robotaxi fever. Shorts are betting they'll be disappointed. As the EV giant prepares to unveil its robotaxi at its much-anticipated event Thursday, the company has found another way to grab the headlines: Elon Musk's company has returned to its old position as the most shorted stock in the U.S. Meanwhile, the stock has been included in Wells Fargo’s latest trading ideas with an underweight call—and skepticism that the robotaxi will deliver on bulls' presumptions. According to data and tech firm Hazeltree, Elon Musk's EV company was the most crowded shorted large-cap security in the Americas in September, returning to a position it held until July. Investors would be less interested in the company—whose stock price has largely recovered from the losses it experienced in the first half of the year—as demand for EVs cooled, though the excitement around the robotaxi could give the stock a boost. Tesla stock is up more than 40% since April 5, when Musk announced plans for the robotaxi event, and it has stayed elevated even after the event was delayed. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan, however, has given Tesla a $120 price target—half its current price—in the bank's tactical trading ideas list for the fourth quarter. Langan wrote that he is skeptical Wednesday's event will “match the high expectations from Tesla bulls, leaving investors to focus on weakening fundamentals.\" Those fundamentals include projections for moderating delivery growth as EV demand drops and the limited potential of discounting to boost sales. He also noted that Musk has promised robotaxis \"by year-end...for years\" but \"experts say the technology is years away & that TSLA’s autonomous technology comes with considerable safety concerns.\" Last week's delivery data sent Tesla stock lower despite beating expectations, as analysts said investors may have wanted Tesla to deliver a stronger quarter. Tesla said Wednesday that its third-quarter results will be released after the market closes on Oct. 23. Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

Let’s take a look at how Werner (NASDAQ:WERN) and the rest of the ground transportation stocks fared in Q2. The growth of e-commerce and global trade continues to drive demand for shipping services, especially last-mile delivery, presenting opportunities for ground transportation companies. The industry continues to invest in data, analytics, and autonomous fleets to optimize efficiency and find the most cost-effective routes. Despite the essential services this industry provides, ground transportation companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies’ offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins. The 16 ground transportation stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1%. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. While some ground transportation stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.1% since the latest earnings results. Conducting business in over a 100 countries, Werner (NASDAQ:WERN) offers full-truckload, less-than-truckload, and intermodal delivery services. Werner reported revenues of $760.8 million, down 6.2% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 1.2%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. “While industry-wide headwinds remain, second quarter earnings improved sequentially, and we made progress on controlling the controllables. One-Way Truckload production increased for the fifth consecutive quarter. Mexico and cross-border related business is growing double-digits. Dedicated revenue per truck was up, and Logistics segment returned to positive operating income,” said Derek Leathers, Chairman and CEO.                     ",

Despite the stormy weather and Middle East anxiety, U.S. economic soundings remain robust and Federal Reserve easing expectations continue to be dialled back - sending the dollar to near two month highs in the process. With the U.S. economy estimated to be still expanding at more than 3%, markets now seeing little more than an 80% chance of another Fed rate cut next month and the whole rate futures curve has backed up some 50 basis points over the past month. That puts a notional Fed 'terminal rate' closer to 3.5% - well above the 2.9% long-term 'neutral' rate Fed policymakers indicated at their last meeting. Minutes of that meeting late Wednesday showed a \"substantial majority\" of officials supported a half-point rate cut to start the easing cycle, but there appeared to be agreement the first move would not commit the Fed to any particular pace thereafter. A stream of Fed speakers this week seem to back that up. \"Two more cuts this year, or one more cut this year, really spans the range of what is likely in my mind,\" San Francisco Fed boss Mary Daly said overnight. After a lacklustre 10-year Treasury note auction on Wednesday, 10-year yields climbed to their highest since July and both two and 10-year yields have now got a foothold back above 4%. Perhaps more concerning for the Fed is creeping market inflation expectations, with so-called 'breakeven' expectations from the 10-year inflation-protected securities markets rising to near three-month highs at 2.3% - nearly 30 basis points higher than they were a month ago. And more worryingly ahead of next month's election, the U.S. Treasury 10-year term premium, a measure of the compensation investors demand to hold long-term government debt securities, moved back into positive territory this week. That spins attention into today's critical consumer price report, where headline annual CPI inflation is expected to ease to 2.3% - its lowest in more than three years - but with 'core' inflation stickier around 3.2%. \"I continue to see a meaningful risk that inflation could get stuck above our 2% goal,\" Dallas Fed chief Lorie Logan said on Wednesday, adding that the Fed \"should not rush to reduce the fed funds target to a 'normal' or 'neutral' level\".

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? A Florida investor was quietly snapping up the company’s stock, buying so much that by Monday he disclosed owning a more than 18% stake — making him the second-biggest shareholder after Leonard Green & Partners, the Los Angeles private equity firm. The move set off alarms at The Container Store’s headquarters: On Tuesday, the company announced that it enacted a so-called poison-pill provision, a method used to ward off unwanted takeovers by making them prohibitively expensive, after the “rapid and significant accumulation” of its shares by a single stockholder. But it turns out Amit Agarwal is no would-be Carl Icahn. He’s a 41-year-old former patent litigator in St. Petersburg, Florida, who works out of the local Subway sandwich shop and likes placing big bets in the stock market and at the poker table. He’s put down $8 million wagering there’s solid potential in the financially struggling retailer — especially if a real buyout artist comes out of the woodwork. “There’s a gem inside this pile of mess and it will shine brightly enough to capture a buyer’s attention,” he said. But, he added: “I could be wrong.” The Container Store, a nationwide chain known for its closet organizers, storage shelves and container bins, has stumbled so badly that even a hobbyist like Agarwal was able to buy a big piece of it. Its stock surged during the Covid lockdowns — when amateur investors were piling into companies that were expected to benefit — only to tumble some 96% since March 2021, cutting its market value to less than $40 million. The company is now contending with a difficult combination: declining revenues, a run of losses and a pile of debt that’s maturing in 2025 and 2026. In May, the company said it hired Latham & Watkins and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to consider strategic alternatives, which typically involves soliciting takeover offers or mulling other steps to deal with financial distress. On Wall Street, the few analysts who still track the company are skeptical of its prospects: One advises selling the shares; the other two deem it a hold. None are suggesting clients buy it. In July, S&P Global Ratings downgraded The Container Store to CCC+, deep into junk grade, seeing mounting risks it will be pushed to default on its debts.                      ",

        "body": "Monzo is now valued at $5.9 billion after the U.K.-based challenger bank confirmed a secondary market share sale to provide liquidity for its employees. The transaction, first rumored yesterday, saw existing investors such as Singapore's sovereign wealth fund (GIC) and StepStone Group procuring additional shares in the London-based fintech. A secondary market sale essentially rewards employees for getting a company to where it is, without having to go public — or, at least, buying it more time. It has been an action-packed year for Monzo. The company raised $190 million in May, just two months after kicking off a $425 million Series I round that saw Alphabet's CapitalG and sister VC firm GV making a rare co-investment. The startup has now raised around $1.5 billion since its foundation nine years ago. At the time of its March fundraise, Monzo said its pre-money valuation was £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion), implying a post-money valuation of £4 billion ($5 billion) -- this valuation rose slightly with the second tranche that followed in May. The following month, Monzo reported its first full-year (pre-tax) profit, with its revenues more than doubling from the previous year. The company claims 20% of U.K. adults as customers as well as 6% of businesses in the country. This growth, coupled with a roadmap that includes a wider European expansion and plans to accelerate its rollout in the U.S market where it appointed a new CEO last October, has clearly been deemed sufficient for a valuation bump in the past five months. Rival U.K. neobank Revolut recently confirmed a new valuation of $45 billion via a similar secondary market sale, shortly after securing its own banking license in the U.K. and Mexico. \"It’s great to be able to provide employees with some liquidity, while meeting further investor demand for Monzo equity,\" Monzo CEO TS Anil said in a statement.

Beyond what’s commonly known — that a lot of the fundings today are insider rounds and bridge financings aimed at keeping companies alive — cash back to the limited partners (LPs) who fund venture firms has slowed to the global financial crisis levels of 16 years ago. Meanwhile, with LPs snapping shut their checkbooks as their returns slow, the number of VCs and angel investors investing in a startup in the first quarter of this year fell to just 45.5% of those who were striking deals in 2021. Pressure is building. VCs are sitting on unicorns that now account for $2.5 trillion in value, says PitchBook -- and nearly 40% of these have been in their VCs’ portfolio for at least nine years. Overall, the backlog of companies yet to exit has ballooned to 57,674, a record high, with late-stage companies accounting for 32.4% of those outfits. "

Starboard Value said they had scheduled a meeting with CEO Albert Bourla, Shantanu Narayen, and potentially other Board members on October 16. They plan to share their perspectives and discuss Pfizer’s future direction. Also Read: Former Pfizer Executives Ian Read And Frank D’Amelio Support Albert Bourla’s Leadership Amid Starboard Activism: ‘Will Deliver Shareholder Value.’ The letter highlights recent press reports that Starboard reached out to the company’s former CEO, Ian Read, and former CFO, Frank D’Amelio, as part of their due diligence process. Both Mr. Read and Mr. D’Amelio expressed concerns regarding Pfizer’s current trajectory. As former executives and significant individual shareholders with a strong understanding of Pfizer’s stakeholders, they conveyed a shared desire for the company to pursue a more promising course and offered assistance. The letter states that interaction with the former executives has been limited to this, which aligns with publicly available information. The letter adds that individuals within Pfizer or their representatives have allegedly contacted Mr. Read and Mr. D’Amelio, threatening legal action, the recovery of prior compensation, and the cancellation of unvested performance stock units unless they publicly support the current CEO. The shareholder urges the Board to establish a special committee of impartial members to investigate the matter, determine who authorized such actions, and hold the responsible parties accountable. Concurrently, Pfizer released topline results from the final prespecified overall survival (OS) analysis of the TALAPRO-2 study of Talzenna (talazoparib) in combination with Xtandi (enzalutamide) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the final OS in all-comers (cohort 1) and in patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC (cohort 2) compared to Xtandi alone. At the time of the final analysis, the clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) was maintained in both cohorts from the prior primary analysis previously reported and published in The Lancet. The FDA approved Talzenna in combination with Xtandi for adult patients with HRR gene-mutated mCRPC in June 2023. The European Commission also approved the combination in January 2024 for adult patients with mCRPC whose chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.          ",

Polyester, described as the largest driver of this growth, has replaced cotton as the \"most widely used fibre in the world\" since the mid to late 2000s. The report noted that global fibre production per person has also increased significantly, growing from 8.3 kilograms per person in 1975 to 15.5 kilograms per person in 2023, with this figure expected to rise to 18.8 kilograms per person by 2030 if business continues as usual. Synthetic fibres dominated global fibre production in 2023, accounting for approximately 67% (84 million tonnes). Polyester led the market with a 57% share, followed by polyamide (nylon) at 5%, while other synthetic fibres combined for an additional 5%. Plant-based fibres made up about 25% of the global fibre market in 2023. Cotton was the second-most produced fibre globally, with 24.7 million tonnes, representing 20% of total fibre production. Non-cotton plant fibres, including hemp, flax, and jute, held a 5% share, contributing 6.7 million tonnes. Manmade cellulosic fibres (MMCFs) accounted for 6% of global production, totalling 7.9 million tonnes, with viscose representing 5% and other MMCFs holding a combined 1.3%. Animal fibres comprised just 1% of global production, with wool at 0.9%, and other animal fibres (beyond wool) contributing only 0.07%.

AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors. But not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities. Covering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology. So, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy. Meta Platforms We’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted. Meta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations. Solid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.

        "body": "By Helen Reid LONDON (Reuters) - IKEA annual sales fell 5% after the Swedish budget homeware retailer cut prices in a bid to attract more shoppers and maintain its share of a shrinking home furniture market, but it expects a recovery next year. Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores globally, reported 39.6 billion euros ($43.3 billion) in sales for its financial year ended Aug. 31. \"In all our markets we experienced a slowdown of the economy and a slowdown of the home furnishing industry, almost simultaneously,\" said Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group. \"We never experienced anything like that since 2008, to be honest.\" After seeing a decline in store visits and sold quantities, IKEA decided to cut prices, which boosted footfall and the amount of products sold, Brodin said. Ingka Group said it invested more than 2.1 billion euros in price cuts across its markets, and its share of the global home furnishing market stayed steady at 5.7%. IKEA has benefited from households trading down as a global property slowdown hurt confidence, said Tolga Oncu, retail manager at Ingka Group. For 2025, IKEA expects a boost to sales as lower interest rates drive more people to move house, which usually prompts buying of beds, sofas, and bookcases. Store visits increased by 3.3% to 727 million this year, slower than the 7.4% growth seen in 2023 and new openings fell to 41, from 60. Ingka plans 58 new locations worldwide in its 2025 financial year. Its share of sales made online increased to 28%, up from 26% in 2023. NOT GOING OUT AT CHRISTMAS This holiday season, like last year, Oncu expects people to spend more time hosting at home rather than going out, with budgets still constrained by inflation. Inter IKEA Group, which owns the IKEA brand and manufactures the products, reported annual sales of 45.1 billion euros ($49.3 billion) across all franchisees, of which Ingka Group is the biggest. That was down 5.3% compared to 2023, largely due to price cuts as the cost of raw materials like wood fell. Inter IKEA CEO Jon Abrahamsson Ring said more price reductions were planned for its 2025 financial year, which started on Sept. 1, but likely not as significant.

The changes included replacing CFO Natalie Knight with China COO Doug Ostermann. The company said the changes were made to \"redouble\" its focus on key priorities and address global challenges facing the industry.  Stellantis (STLA) shares lost ground in early trading Friday after the \"Big Three\" automaker announced an executive shakeup as it tries to recover from a sales slump. The parent of the Jeep, Chrysler, and other brands said CFO Natalie Knight is leaving the company, and will be replaced by the firm’s China COO Doug Ostermann. Alfa Romeo brand CEO Jean-Philippe Imparato will also become CEO of the Enlarged Europe division, succeeding Uwe Hochgeschurtz, who is also departing. Antonio Filosa, head of South American operations, will be North America COO, succeeding Carlos Zarlenga, “whose next position will be subject to a further announcement.” Other changes included appointing Gregoire Olivier COO in China and Santo Ficili as CEO of Maserati and Alfa Romeo. Stellantis said the moves were designed “to redouble the Company’s focus on its key business priorities and confront head-on the global challenges facing the industry.” CEO Carlos Tavares called this a “Darwinian period for the automotive industry,” and said the new management team is expected to help “tackle the challenges ahead.” Stellantis has been reeling from a slowing car market, excess inventory, and Chinese competition. Last month, the automaker cut its outlook. Last week, it posted a significant drop in U.S. sales. Barclays downgraded the stock following the news, warning it sees no real recovery for Stellantis until at least the first half of next year. Shares of Stellantis were down about 3% in early trading Friday and have lost more than 40% of their value since the start of the year. TradingView Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "In this piece, I evaluated two electric vehicle stocks: BYD (BYDDY) (BYDDF) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN). A closer look suggests a bearish view for BYD and a neutral view for Rivian. China-based BYD is known for producing vehicles like the budget-friendly Atto 3 electric SUV, the Dolphin electric hatchback, and the Seal battery-electric mid-size sedan, among other vehicles. In addition to cars, BYD is also active in various industries, including the production of rechargeable batteries and mobile handset components. Meanwhile, Rivian is known for the R1S electric SEUV, the R1T electric pickup truck, and its electric delivery van, the EDV. American Depository Receipt (ADR) shares of BYD have surged 23% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date return to 38% and their one-year gain to 25%. Importantly, each ADR share of BYD traded over the counter in the U.S. is worth two H shares traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In contrast, Rivian Automotive stock has plummeted 36% over the last three months, dragging its year-to-date plunge down to 55%. The stock is off 47% over the past year. The market’s opposite reactions to these two stocks may have some investors wondering if Rivian offers a buy-the-dip opportunity. However, there’s more to both stocks than it appears. Let’s take a look. BYD is strongly tied to the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets right now. As such, this stock could continue to encounter significant volatility in light of what’s happening in those stock markets. Thus, a bearish view looks appropriate. First, an understanding of BYD’s business is helpful. As already stated, the company doesn’t just sell EVs, so there is much more to consider with the Chinese automaker. Additionally, BYD offers exposure to both battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids, which is critical right now as most of the growth in the clean-energy vehicle space is in hybrids rather than BEVs. Turning to the current issues with Chinese stocks, China’s stock market has gone through significant ups and downs recently. The latest news is that China’s central bank revealed a US$70 billion financing facility to fund institutional buying, which sent the Hang Seng Index up 3% at the market close on Oct. 10. Despite some recovery, the index remains down 6.5% for the week ending Oct. 10, following an earlier drop. All eyes are now on the weekend as investors hope for even more stimulus from the People’s Bank of China. If the central bank falls short, Chinese stocks could tumble further. Conversely, if more stimulus is introduced, they could rally, potentially driving BYD’s stock higher, pushing it beyond an attractive buy price.               ",

The company garnered negative coverage in July when a flawed software update caused worldwide tech outages, but RBC said CrowdStrike is successfully moving past the incident. Delta Air Lines said it continues to seek compensation from CrowdStrike related to the incident.  Shares of cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) added more than 5% on Thursday, notching the S&P 500's top performance of the day, after RBC Capital named the company one of its top investment ideas in North American software for 2025. CrowdStrike drew scrutiny in mid-July when the firm's defective software update caused widespread technology outages across the world. Fallout from that incident sent CrowdStrike shares tumbling, and it's still below the levels seen after those events—but the stock has been on a path of recovery since printing a low in early August. According to analysts at RBC, the negative headlines about the midsummer software update and subsequent technological interruptions generated \"short-term noise\" surrounding CrowdStrike stock, but the company appears poised to emerge from the situation in a strong position. RBC believes CrowdStrike could be on track to achieve $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company's management team recently reiterated its goal to achieve this ambitious milestone by fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike's ARR for fiscal 2024 came in at over $3.4 billion. CrowdStrike continues to face issues stemming from the July incident. When Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported lower-than-expected sales and profits in its quarterly report released Thursday, the carrier cited the negative impact of the CrowdStrike outage, which resulted in the cancellation of thousands of flights. According to Delta, the incident caused a $380 million hit to revenue in the quarter. The airline's CEO said Delta continues to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft (MSFT) related to the outages. Following Thursday's gains, CrowdStrike shares are trading around 23% higher year-to-date but remain around 21% below the all-time highs seen this summer before the incident.

But the stock has been climbing lately, about doubling from September lows. The shares can be volatile, trading on views regarding former President Donald Trump's political fortunes as well as company news.  Shares of Truth Social's parent company jumped Thursday, rising as the company announced some product news that helped the stock touch its highest level in months. Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) stock recently was up more than 16% to around $24. The move comes as the shares have risen off lows below $12 per share touched last month. Today's move likely was spurred in part by the company's announcement that a new app for watching its streaming video offering is now available in Google's Play Store. But the stock generally has risen in recent weeks, moving off lows driven by investor questions about whether the expiration of lock-up agreements governing some investors' trades would be followed by widespread selling by former President Donald Trump, its majority owner, or other big investors. That, for the most part, hasn't happened. That extended a run of volatility that has lasted nearly as long as the stock, which hit the public markets earlier this year via a merger with a blank-check company, has been publicly traded. The shares—which trade in part on investors' read on whether Trump might be re-elected—are still well off 2024 highs near $80, though now back at levels last seen in August.
