        "body": "China’s policymakers disappointed investors this week with a lack of follow-through on recent monetary policy stimulus measures. They get a second chance this weekend. China’s Ministry of Finance is set to hold a briefing on Saturday local time that’s expected to deliver up to 2 trillion yuan, or about $282 billion, in fiscal stimulus to an economy that continues to stagger under real-estate woes. My mother-in-law stole $25,000 from my husband’s emergency fund. We donated to charity rather than give her a birthday gift — and she cried foul. ‘It’s so unfair!’ I’m miserable in my job. I’m 58 and have $1 million in a 401(k) and Roth IRA. Can I afford to quit? ‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust? ‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off? ‘Their house was purchased with my family money’: My late father left a life estate to his second wife. She’s only 10 years older than me. How can I undo this? “Our economists highlight that the current market expectation is for a CNY1.5-2 trillion package (excluding CNY1 trillion in recapitalisation for big banks) and it will be important whether the actual announcement meets this threshold after a week of nervousness following a week or so of euphoria,” Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a Friday note. Euphoria indeed. Chinese stocks ripped higher at the end of September after the announcement of rate cuts and other measures by the People’s Bank of China aimed at breaking the economy out of its funk. But the rally stalled this week as investors returned from a holiday week looking for more support on the fiscal front. A briefing from the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s state economic planning body, on Tuesday failed to outline more stimulus measures, sending stocks into a skid. The China CSI 300 XX:000300 fell more than 3% this week, while the Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP dropped 3.6% the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI in Hong Kong dropped more than 6%. China-related ETFs saw sharp falls and were among the week’s biggest decliners. The Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF ASHR was off nearly 14% for the week, while the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB dropped nearly 10%. Deutsche Bank estimated that the total size of both fiscal and monetary stimulus could potentially reach CNY7.5 trillion, or 6% of GDP in 2024. That would make it the largest package in yuan terms and the third largest relative to GDP, Reid said. On the fiscal side, a CNY2 trillion yuan package would be comparable in size to what the government did in its 2020 pandemic response combined with other measures (see chart below).           ",

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump is again turning heads with his push to slash the federal corporate tax rate. The 2024 GOP presidential nominee proposes lowering it from 21% to 15%, which has stirred up much debate. Some see it as the key to supercharging the U.S. economy and stock market. Others, however, aren't so sure. Don't Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. Supporters of Trump’s plan point to past economic gains when taxes were lowered. According to the Tax Foundation, dropping the corporate tax rate to 15% could boost the U.S. GDP by 0.4% and add roughly 93,000 full-time jobs. This is music to the ears of those who believe that lower taxes will make the U.S. more attractive for business. A more competitive environment, they argue, could drive corporate growth, pump up earnings and ultimately benefit shareholders as stock prices climb. Trending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share Advocates also think this cut could push companies to funnel more money into share buybacks, further inflating stock prices. But the critics have their doubts. One big concern is the potential impact on federal revenues. As cited by CNN, Trump’s proposal could increase the national debt by between $1.5 trillion and $15.2 trillion. Even when factoring in economic growth, the revenue loss would still be a whopping $460 billion. As the U.S. grapples with a rising federal deficit – already expected to hit 202.6% of GDP by 2065 – some worry that these tax cuts might tie the government's hands when funding essential programs. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Another question in the air is whether corporate tax cuts reliably lead to stock market booms? Trump significantly boosted Corporate America by lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This legislation, along with a strong economy, led to record-breaking corporate earnings. Many executives decided to reward shareholders rather than investing in growth or hiring.             "

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. kick off the the quarterly earnings-report cycle on Friday, followed by Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Bank of America Corp. next week. Banks provide a good read on the state of both consumers and other companies, making their quarterly reports a crucial part of the earnings season. US bank stocks jumped almost 10% in the third quarter amid optimism around policymakers’ rate-cutting cycle and the resilient state of the economy, turning the latest update into a test of whether expectations ran too far. So far the going has been good for banks. Second quarter earnings were the second best among S&P 500 sub-industries with banks notably trouncing the S&P 500 Index as a whole, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. The focus is now on how net interest income, loan and deposit growth, credit quality, and consumer spending resilience will fare as US interest rates come down from a more than two-decade high. Bank stocks have been on a roll this year, with the KBW Bank Index rising almost 21%, roughly in line with the S&P 500 — no small feat considering the broader benchmark has seen its gains largely powered by tech giants like Nvidia and Apple. Still, the rally for banks has pushed them back around the peaks seen in late July. Analysts are split pretty evenly between buy and hold ratings. The split sets the tone for the earnings ahead; half expect the going to get better, while the other half have signaled caution. “Investors still seem optimistic about 2025 prospects, but with lingering near-term anxiety on net interest income,” said Piper Sandler’s analyst R. Scott Siefers. “In order words,” he wrote in a note, “while investors are optimistic about next year’s prospects, the path to get there could still be bumpy.” In September, JPMorgan President and Chief Operating Officer Daniel Pinto sent shares tumbling after warning investors that analysts are being too optimistic in projecting next year’s expenses and net interest income as rates start coming down. Pinto said that the net interest income estimate of $89.5 billion was “not very reasonable” given interest-rate expectations, and the figure “will be lower.”                "

        "body": "By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) - BlackRock's assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows, while the world's largest asset manager continued a push to expand its footprint in private markets. Assets managed by BlackRock shot to $11.48 trillion in the period, compared with $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter, the company said on Friday. That growth came as stocks reversed an August sell-off and broadened their rally in the third quarter, boosted by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. BlackRock is expanding its offerings to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. \"Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working,\" Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. The company's shares were recently up 3.6% on Friday. They have advanced about 18% in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21% jump in the S&P 500. Last week, the New York-based firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding over $100 billion in assets to its kitty. Later this year, it is expected to close its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin. The two deals are expected to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and in private markets, both key areas of growth. \"Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets in powering economic growth,\" Fink said in an earnings call on Friday. BlackRock registered $160 billion in long-term net inflows in the third quarter. Total net inflows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as interest rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. But with interest rates expected to fall as the Federal Reserve continues a long-anticipated easing cycle it kicked off in September, some of that money could flow into assets such as fixed income products, a development Fink said could occur in a more “normalized” but \"relatively high-rate environment.” Equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2%. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier.    ",

        "body": "Indexes slipped Thursday as investors priced in a higher-than-expected inflation reading. The data raises the possibility of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy. Traders still see the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points at next month's meeting. Stocks fell on Thursday from records reached in the previous session, as traders took in a sticky inflation reading for September. All three benchmark indexes fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down TK points, a 0.40% fall, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.% and 0.%, respectively. The declines follow rises across the board on Wednesday, which saw a fresh record close for both the S&P 500 and the Dow, and comes after inflation proved stickier than expected last month. September consumer price index data released on Thursday showed inflation rose 2.4% year-over-year, slightly above consensus forecasts of a 2.3% rise. The core CPI reading, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, was up 3.3% year-over-year and just above forecasts of 3.2%. The reading, coupled with last week's blockbuster jobs report, has sparked talk of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy, a scenario in which strong economic growth fuels inflation and makes it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut rates. A no landing would likely mean rate cuts are fewer or slower than markets had previously forecast. It would also mean borrowers are saddled with higher interest rates on their debt for longer. After the CPI release, investors adjusted their expectations for the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. The September jobs report had killed the odds of another big 50 basis point cut, but the slightly higher-than-expected CPI likely isn't enough to fully pump the brakes on Fed easing. \"Heading into the report, we thought only a very firm print would lead the Fed to consider pausing in November based on inflation alone. We did not get that,\" analysts from Bank of America said Thursday. \"While core PCE will be firmer than recent months, we think it will be enough for the Fed to follow through with a 25bp cut in November,\" they added. Investors are now pricing in higher odds of a 25 basis point rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims edged up 33,000 to 258,000, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That number marks its highest level in over a year and outpaced forecasts of 230,000. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the closing bell on Thursday: S&P 500: 5,780.05, down 0.21% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 42,454.12, down 0.14% (-57.88 points) Nasdaq composite: 18,282.05, down 0.05%           "

        "body": "Donald Trump’s campaign team is examining steps to sideline Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, should the former president return to the White House. Speaking with Barron’s, Trump economic advisor Scott Bessent suggested Congress approve a Fed chair designate more than a year before the central bank governor’s term expires in May 2026. This would effectively install a babysitter alongside the current Fed chair, and it could render Powell a lame duck for the remainder of his time in office. Bessent, founder of the hedge fund Key Square Group, is reportedly on the short list for Treasury secretary in a second Trump administration, according to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal. “You could do the earliest Fed nomination and create a shadow Fed chair,” Bessent told Barron’s. “And based on the concept of forward guidance, no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore.” During Trump’s latter half in office, his relationship with the Fed chair, whom the president himself had appointed, became increasingly acrimonious. Powell repeatedly ignored White House pressure to help the president’s reelection chances by juicing the economy through lower interest rates. Taking to Twitter to launch a tirade against Powell became a regular occurrence. Once Trump even asked whether the Fed chair was a bigger enemy to the American people than China’s Xi Jinping. Bessent said he has circulated the plan to sideline Powell among fellow Trump campaign advisors, where it was well received. Nonetheless, this is not official policy, at least not yet. “This is my idea,” the hedge fund manager added, “not the president’s.” Citing his purported business acumen, Trump has openly expressed a desire to erode the U.S. central bank’s prized independence. This has sparked comparisons to Richard Nixon, whose Fed chair was widely considered the worst in the institution’s recent history. Ed Yardeni, a Wall Street veteran and president of Yardeni Research, told the publication it was a “terrible” idea. A shadow Fed chair would “create a lot of noise in the market,” leaving investors guessing as to whose words weighed more heavily within the FOMC, the Fed’s main policy-setting committee. “Everybody would be looking at the calendar to see when Powell is out,” Yardeni told Barron’s. The independence of the Fed from the political vagaries on Pennsylvania Avenue and Capitol Hill is considered sacrosanct—a crucial prerequisite for a responsible monetary policy that places price stability at its core.

The ministry didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. While major Western merchants stopped originating grain for export in Russia after facing government pressure in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, the traders can still buy cargoes of Russian grain from other firms. Those transactions still typically occur at large volumes. The Russian grain industry has grown increasingly consolidated after Western merchants pulled back and as the country’s top private trader faced a spat with the state. That put the market in the hands of fewer companies, some of which have or had links to the Kremlin. Top Supplier Russia is the world’s biggest wheat exporter and any disruptions to its export flows would boost costs of the staple grain for buyers from Africa to Asia. Wheat also remains a major source of export revenue and political influence for the nation in the midst of its invasion of Ukraine, as food isn’t directly sanctioned. The union said that exporters had agreed not to provide Russian grain to foreign winners of tenders, during a meeting on the sidelines of the Golden Autumn exhibition in Moscow this week. It also criticized new exporters for “dumping” of grain and said that such practices must be eradicated. While wheat supplies in the country remain large, farmers reaped a smaller harvest this year amid frost and dry weather, breaking a streak of bumper production. Russia normally limits exports in the latter part of the season from February to June, with allowances allocated based on the volume traders exported in the first half. Quotas have not been restrictive in recent seasons. Still, Moscow’s exports at the start of the season have matched last year’s record volumes, which was expected to restrain shipments later on.        "

Chairman of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee, Alexey Kalitsev said in a statement: “As the committee expected, sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles kept on growing in September. As forecasted, this is largely due to the expectation of price increases amid changes in disposal fee rates and an increase in the key [interest] rate. “A record August was followed by a very successful September, which results significantly exceeded last year's figures. “However, despite the success, overall sales in the third quarter did not go beyond the sales volume in the second quarter of this year. This may indicate that we are approaching a limitation of the market's growth potential due to a decrease in purchasing power and the satisfaction of deferred demand from consumers. Most likely, the positive dynamics will continue in the coming months, butwill not be as rapid. “The results of 9 months demonstrate that, with a high degree of probability, by the end of 2024 the market will achieve higher figures than the committee forecasted earlier. “To ensure further market development, government support for demand and local production will be required.\" As European countries exited Russia following Russia’s military operations in Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent imposition of economic sanctions, Chinese OEMs have effectively replaced them in the Russian market and also started local assembly/manufacturing operations. Soaring trailer demand Gary Beecroft, an analyst with UK consultants CLEAR, also estimates that trailer demand has soared in Russia over the past two years. \"Russia's economy has shifted toward buying higher quantities of transport assets,\" he says. \"This has included heavy goods trailers. We estimate that overall trailer sales in Russia this year will be approaching 36,000, which compares with 24,000 in 2021, a more normal volume year for the industry. \"And again, the Chinese are filling the gaps left by Western manufacturers who previously exported to Russia - for both trucks and trailers.\"      "

        "body": "AI enthusiasm has rebounded in recent weeks after investors worried about returns over the summer. In the next wave of investment, Goldman Sachs analysts recommend \"platform\" stocks like Microsoft and Datadog. Analysts recommend stocks that will build a direct application of AI and allow for more widespread adoption. Move over, Nvidia. With artificial intelligence investment rebounding after excitement cooled over the summer, a new set of stocks is set to benefit from the next wave of cash flowing to the burgeoning sector, according to Goldman Sachs. In the next round of AI investment, Goldman Sachs analysts say investors should look past the obvious picks—Nvidia and AI infrastructure companies—and toward a select set of platforms set to build out a direct application of AI. \"Our equity analysts believe 'platform' stocks, including databases and development tools, are set to be the primary beneficiaries of the next wave of generative AI investments. These platforms allow the best use of AI infrastructure while providing building blocks to construct next generation applications,\" the analysts said in a Thursday note. The analysts name Microsoft, DataDog, MongoDB, Elastic, and Snowflake as the best-positioned platform stocks as they roll out AI-integrated applications. While many of those platform stocks have plunged this year on near-term fundamental weakness, they have historically low valuations and stabilizing revisions that set them up well as AI investment rebounds, the analysts say. The analysts' recommendations come as investors remain focused on Nvidia and the companies that build out AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors, cloud providers, and data center REITs. The analysts say the share prices for those stocks will likely continue to increase, but returns will be driven more by earnings than valuations. \"Expected future returns could be constrained by elevated starting valuations, although valuations are historically a poor near-term signal for large-cap equities,\" the analysts said, adding that with AI spend surprising less to the upside than before, that could make for more moderate returns for those \"phase 2\" AI infrastructure stocks. In general, the platform stocks are the exception among other \"phase 3\" stocks—those with potential to monetize AI by generating incremental revenues like in software and IT services— because the timing of AI monetization is still uncertain. The same goes for \"phase 4\" stocks, or companies that would benefit from widespread adoption in general since that's likely still years away, the analysts said.     "

But now the nation’s chippies may want to reconsider: they could be sitting on supplies of liquid gold. For the first time, a major stock exchange is set to launch a market for supplies of waste cooking oils as production of eco-fuels becomes big business. Bursa Malaysia, Malaysia’s biggest stock market and the main hub for trading palm oil globally, is considering the launch of futures contracts for used cooking oil, according to Bloomberg. Cooking oil and similar waste are common by-products of restaurants and food manufacturers that use deep fat fryers. A typical tabletop fryer holds about 10 litres of oil and this needs to be changed at least once or twice a week, according to Bio UK Fuels, a Sheffield-based company that recycles the waste. This used oil can be used as a feedstock to produce so-called biofuels, which produce fewer carbon emissions compared to traditional petrol and diesel products. These are increasingly being used to fuel vehicles, provide heating and generate electricity, with the European Union adopting rules last year to mandate uptake. Waste oil biofuels consumption rose globally by almost 40pc between 2021 and 2023, according to an estimate from the Transport & Environment lobby group. Bursa Malaysia plans to offer US dollar-denominated contracts for lots of 25 metric tons of used cooking oil, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. A spokesperson for Bursa Malaysia said changes may still be made, with any contract launch subject to regulatory approval. Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

But on Wall Street things are eerily quiet, as the so-called smart money is reluctant to wager on what’s about to happen. Most Read from Bloomberg San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? “Never bet on the flip of a coin,” said George Ball, head of the Houston-based investment firm Sanders Morris Harris. “The election is too close to permit thoughtful investment positioning.” Hedge funds aren’t reducing their stock positions the way they historically do ahead of elections, and instead have elevated exposure to equities as the S&P 500 Index continues to set records, according to Goldman Sachs prime brokerage data going back to 2008. Meanwhile, options traders are more focused on the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cuts and the health of the US economy, putting the Nov. 5 vote lower on the list of immediate priorities, market veterans say. “Concerns about the elections are around fifth in line behind the war in the Middle East, the explosive moves in China, the push-and-pull of US economic data and shifting Fed easing expectations, upcoming earnings season, etcetera,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. The most recent election polling averages from Real Clear Politics show Democrat Kamala Harris with 49.2% support nationally, and Republican Donald Trump at 47.2%. But with the Electoral College, national averages are far less important than state-by-state polls, which essentially show a neck-and-neck race. And the chance of either party sweeping the presidency and both houses of Congress is considered low. Wait-And-See “First, it’s a very close presidential race, especially in the swing states,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. “Second, both candidates have very ambitious economic goals, and I highly doubt either will be able to fully implement these campaign promises unless their party takes the White House, the Senate, and the House.” Hedge funds are taking a wait-and-see approach to the election, waiting until there’s more clarity before making significant politically connected investment bets, said Jonathan Caplis, chief executive officer of hedge fund research firm PivotalPath. The approach has worked so far this year, as US long-short hedge funds have posted an 11% gain through September, which is in the top quartile of rolling nine-month returns since 2010, according to PivotalPath.

        "body": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock fell 1.7% Thursday after rallying as much as 9% the day before continuing its roller coaster ride of a week as investors swing between optimism over the company’s strong financials and cautiousness over its regulatory risks. Super Micro is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegations of shady business practices outlined in a scathing report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research in late August. That has pressured the stock, which has hovered under $50 per share since then. This week, SMCI climbed on positive reports from the AI server maker. Super Micro surged 16% Monday after the company released numbers showing strong demand for its products. The stock was up 12% on Thursday from the prior week. Super Micro makes servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips for data centers that power artificial intelligence software. The company said it’s shipping servers containing over 100,000 Nvidia GPUs per quarter “for some of the largest AI factories ever built.” Then on Tuesday, shares of SMCI fell 5% after a promising premarket rally that saw the stock jump as much as 7%. Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, said investors’ euphoria over the company’s shipment data faded against the backdrop of Super Micro’s regulatory risk. “I think one piece of good news hardly undoes multiple months of significant financial and regulatory scrutiny around a company like this,” Newman said. The Hindenburg report in August accused Super Micro of shoddy accounting, undisclosed relationships between its CEO and companies it does business with, and violations of US export bans. For example, Hindenburg said Super Micro has shipped servers to sanctioned Russian firms through shell companies, some of which were likely used by its military for its war against Ukraine. The day after Hindenburg released its report, Super Micro shares dropped 20%. The company also delayed filing its annual 10-K report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Super Micro’s woes continued with a Wall Street Journal report of an alleged DOJ probe, which sent shares tumbling in late September. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said the Hindenburg report contained “false or inaccurate statements” and “misleading presentations of information that we have previously shared publicly.” Liang said the company’s delayed 10-K filing would not affect the company’s fourth quarter financial results, adding that Super Micro would address Hindenburg’s allegations “in due course.” Super Micro’s stock climb this week displays the tension between its potential as a key player in the AI boom and its regulatory hurdles.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Celsius’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Celsius and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago when the stock gained 14% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results that blew past analysts' revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations. Notably, topline growth was strong as revenue grew 95% year on year, driven mostly by North American revenue (up 97% year on year). Management noted that the North American business was led by expansion in distribution points and higher SKUs per location. International revenue also came in strong. This was driven by new flavor launches, product availability, and increased velocity. As a result, the gross margin improved significantly (up 110% y/y) and contributed significantly to the EBITDA beat. On the other hand, its EPS narrowly missed analysts' expectations. Zooming out, this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track. Celsius is down 41.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $34.40 per share, it is trading 64.2% below its 52-week high of $96.11 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Celsius’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $32,048.

The stock barometer has gained 21.2% already in 2024, registering 44 record closes along the way. Inevitably, those of a bearish bent have been getting more anxious as the S&P 500 ascends into the rarefied air near 6,000. At such peaks dizzy climbers are more prone to silly mistakes, they warn. My mother-in-law stole $25,000 from my husband’s emergency fund. We donated to charity rather than give her a birthday gift — and she cried foul. ‘It’s so unfair!’ I’m miserable in my job. I’m 58 and have $1 million in a 401(k) and Roth IRA. Can I afford to quit? ‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust? ‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off? ‘Their house was purchased with my family money’: My late father left a life estate to his second wife. She’s only 10 years older than me. How can I undo this? Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, is having none of that. Carson turned bullish in Nov. 2022, dismissing those who warned that stocks would continue to struggle as recession loomed for the U.S. In fact, Detrick notes, the economy appears to be warming up, not slowing down, and importantly the bull market is actually quite young. “That’s right, a two-year bull market historically has plenty of life left, with the average bull market since 1950 lasting more than five years and gaining more than 180%,” he says. Detrick reminds us that the market Cassandras have been consistently vocal during this current rally. He recalls that a year ago there were many observers saying that a relatively weak first year of a bull market — stocks were up about 20% — meant the recovery could not be sustained. “We noted this was probably the wrong way to look at it and suggested being open to the possibility of huge gains in year two. Well, after more than 30% gains during the second year of the bull market we would say that indeed was the way to look at things,” Detrick says. Of course, the crucial question for investors is whether they’ll be celebrating the bull’s third birthday. Detrick thinks they will, though history suggests traders should not expect such big gains. “We found that out of 16 previous bull markets (after bear or near bear markets), 12 of them made it to their third birthday, with an average gain of about 8% and a median return of nearly 10% in year three, pretty much what your average year does,” says Detrick.

Things were decidedly not normal, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. Of course, all of this affected the fashion industry from the brands and retailers to the textile manufacturers, the mills and farmers that produce natural fibers like cotton. Subsequent sourcing interruptions, inflation and concerns about recession were some of the pandemic’s lasting effects. But now, experts say it seems we’re “coming back to normal.” More from Sourcing Journal These Were the Men's Cotton and Denim Looks Coming Out of Fashion Week How Accessibility and Awareness Can Catapult Circular Change The Surprising Ways Gen Z is Shopping Now And that’s good news as the industry recently acknowledged the third official United Nations World Cotton Day on Oct. 7. The day is meant to acknowledge that “cotton is more than just a commodity. This natural fabric is a life-changing product worldwide that sustains 32 million growers (almost half of them women) and benefits over 100 million families across 80 countries in five continents.” In his last Monthly Economic Letter, Cotton Incorporated’s Jon Devine, senior economist in the corporate strategy and program metrics division, states that after several months of decline, cotton prices stabilized in August. “Things have been tougher for U.S. growers because prices are down,” Devine told the Lifestyle Monitor™ in an interview. “But for manufacturers, they should gradually see things come back to normal. The orders were overbooked up to the first half of 2022, but it’s been really quiet since then because inflation and higher interest rates raised concerns about recession. As we move beyond those fears, we should see a return to more predictable business conditions. This should be a relief because the volume on orders has been switching back and forth between zero and 10 in recent years. If orders can settle back at a comfortable six or seven and be less herky-jerky, it will bring more clarity and more ability to plan.” And retailers should be planning for a solid fourth quarter, according to the National Retail Federation’s Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist. “The momentum of the economy during the third quarter looks decent even though the labor market is showing some weakness,” Kleinhenz told the Monitor™ in an interview. “Consumers have remained resilient and have been driving the economy. Spending for the first eight months of the year is very much in line with NRF’s 2024 forecast of retail sales growth between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent, which is great, although a bit of a slower pace than last year. The holiday shopping season is just around the corner, and we believe consumers will remain engaged for the holiday season.”                           "

This is part of efforts to prepare for its next growth phase, which includes achieving an annual recurring revenue of $5 billion. Desai is a high-profile tech executive who has a track record for driving innovation at scale. Most recently, he served as President and Chief Operating Officer at ServiceNow (NOW) and helped scale the company from $1.5 billion to more than $10 billion in annualized revenue. During his time at ServiceNow, he oversaw products, platform, design, engineering, customer support, cloud infrastructure operations, and customer success. Many have pointed out that he's been quoted almost as often as the CEO, especially with regards to product details and updates. Before assuming the ServiceNow COO role, Desai was Chief Product Officer. In a blog post, he wrote about joining Cloudflare. \"The world is in a very interesting moment for technological innovation: the AI landscape is uncharted and developing at an exponential rate; the urgency for enterprises to reduce tech debt and reliance on legacy applications is at an all time high; multi-cloud deployments are becoming a reality for optimal performance and global scale; and high performance connectivity is table stakes. Cloudflare finds itself in a compelling position at the intersection of these key themes.\" Is now the time to buy Cloudflare? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Cloudflare’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock gained 5.2% as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent). The Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years. The Fed—under Chair Jerome Powell—began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot. Looking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25.     ",

JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock shares climbed after beating earnings estimates. US stocks edged higher on Friday after Producer Price Index data for September came in lower than expected, signaling a continued cooling of wholesale inflation. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, Core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. TradeStation strategist David Russell told Business Insider the data supports another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. \"CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not. Overall, these numbers are getting less impactful as inflation moderates. The Fed could still be on track for 25 basis points at the next two meetings. Yields have surged lately, but it's not clear they have much more reason for continued upside,\" Russell said. Investors are also digesting earnings results from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock. All three stocks moved higher after the results, which beat analyst estimates on most fronts. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release, but warned that geopolitical conditions are \"treacherous and getting worse.\" Apart from earnings results, retail sales data, set to be released on October 17, is the next big data release for investors to watch.

In year-on-year (YoY) terms, sales volumes were down 4.8% — September 2023 being a relatively strong base for comparison as improved supply supported the fulfilment of backlogged orders. Sales in Germany remained disappointing as consumer confidence struggles. In what is a seasonally strong month for the UK, the selling rate fell back from recent levels, though YoY growth was in positive territory. Year-to-date (YTD), the Western European market is now flat in comparison to last year (+0.3%). The big picture within the industry remains the same. Strong vehicle pricing, high interest rates, and a lack of incentives, continue to restrict sales. Some improvement is expected moving in 2025 as monetary policy easing supports broad economic expansion. Commentary The PV selling rate for Western Europe fell to 11.3 mn units/year in September. Our outlook for the full year remains subdued, and these incoming figures cement our expectation that the market will not pass 2023’s result. We continue to assume improved market activity in 2025 as the economy picks up, and a more favourable vehicle pricing evolution for consumers. Geopolitical issues, as well as political and economic uncertainty, provide downside risk. The German PV market registered 209k units in September, a 7% decline YoY. The selling rate fell further by 6% MoM to 2.54 million units. Year-to-date sales are now 2.1 million units. Weaker consumer confidence, a staggering economy and a lack of incentives currently continue to have negative effects on the automotive market. Italy’s PV market fell again in September as new car registrations were down 10.7% YoY to 122k units. The selling rate fell by 11% MoM to 1.55 million units. The broader economic challenges in Italy, coupled with difficulties in production, further contributed to the downturn in car sales. The French PV market declined 11.1% YoY to 139k units. The selling rate remained broadly flat at 1.74 million units/year. This is the fifth consecutive month that PV sales have fallen in France in comparison to last year. A lack of subsidies and political uncertainty, especially regarding the fiscal deficit, continue to dampen consumer confidence. The UK PV market registered 275k units September, a 1% increase YoY. The new number plate number month of September is traditionally a bumper month along with March. This was the best performance since 2020; however, was still nearly 20% lower than pre-Covid September 2019. Private consumer demand fell, while fleet purchases continued growth seen in previous months. YTD sales have reached 1.51 million units, a 4.3% increase YoY. Private BEV demand remains down YTD and highlights concerns regarding the future mandated targets. The Spanish PV market registered 73k units in September, a 6.3% increase YoY. Additionally, the selling rate increased by 23% MoM to 1.17 million units/year. Year-to-date sales are now 745k units, a 4.7% increase YoY. The increase in registrations this month saw car rental companies as the main driver of this growth. Despite this, the private channel has performed well.      ",

        "authors": [

        ],

        "body": "SoFi Technologies (SOFI) has positioned itself as one of the most exciting fintech companies, offering a wide range of services and products that many traditional banks struggle to match. While the stock has declined by about 10% this year, I believe this decline is largely due to investors’ short-term preoccupation with challenges, particularly the high-interest rate environment that is now beginning to change. In this article, I will outline five key reasons that support my bullish view of SOFI stock, especially at current levels. The first tenet of my SoFi investment thesis is its impressive top-line growth. In its most recent Q2 results, reported on July 30, SoFi delivered a strong 22% year-over-year increase in adjusted net revenue, reaching a record $597 million. Furthermore, its financial services and technology platform revenue grew by 46% year-over-year and now comprises 45% of total adjusted net revenue, up from just 38% a year ago. This diversification away from lending and toward financial services and technology platforms boosts SoFi’s growth potential and reduces its reliance on a single revenue stream, making the company more resilient. Additionally, SoFi has carved out a niche in financial services by targeting a high-income, young demographic often underserved by traditional banks. While most large banks offer limited specialized services, SoFi provides a comprehensive range of offerings, from student loans to estate planning, allowing it to cater to the specific needs of this demographic. In addition to strong top-line growth, SoFi has been making significant strides in profitability. The fintech has posted three consecutive quarters of profitability, with $17 million of GAAP net income for the 3 months ending in June 2024, compared to a $40 million loss in the year prior. This meaningful improvement drives investor confidence and demonstrates that SoFi’s business model is sustainable and capable of scaling profitably over time. Moreover, SoFi’s focus on product development, along with its commitment to operational efficiency, is poised to drive long-term growth and profitability. Wall Street shares this optimism, projecting robust earnings growth over the next 3 years from $0.11 EPS for 2024 to $0.64 of EPS in 2027. This underscores the company’s strong future prospects. The company’s current valuation is also attractive relative to growth expectations. Currently, SoFi trades at a seemingly stretched forward P/E ratio of 78x. However, if SoFi does reach EPS of $0.64 by 2027, that multiple drops to 13.4x. That valuation is much closer to those of traditional banks, which typically trade at earnings multiples between 11x and 13x. That said, since SoFi’s business is far from mature, and earnings are just getting started, the current P/E ratio premium makes sense. My fourth bullish point is in regards SoFi’s rapid growth of its member base. In the second quarter of 2024, the company added 643,000 new members, representing a 41% year-over-year increase, bringing the total to 8.77 million members. SoFi’s digital-first approach also eliminates the need for brick-and-mortar locations and helps reduce costs while meeting consumer demand for convenient, tech-driven financial services. This strategy positions SoFi well to capitalize on the continued shift toward online banking and fintech innovation. The fifth argument underlying my bullish view of SoFi is potential macroeconomic relief. Management has been concerned over the past few quarters that higher interest rates could dampen economic activity, leading to job losses and missed loan payments. Consequently, management aimed to reduce lending, initially forecasting a decline in revenue of at least 5% for 2024. However, as the Fed cut interest rates by half a percentage point a few weeks ago, management’s outlook will likely improve. SoFi may have weathered the worst of the rising interest rate cycle. Lower interest rates typically improve economic activity, reducing the risk of loan losses. Despite diversification efforts, SoFi’s balance sheet remains heavily concentrated in lending, with a loan-to-asset ratio of approximately 77.4%. Management’s caution was justified, as an increase in defaults could seriously threaten results. Notably, the 90-day personal loan delinquency rate fell to 64 basis points in the most recent quarter, down from 72 basis points in Q1, indicating a potential peak in delinquencies. Despite the bullish arguments presented in this article, Wall Street remains cautious on SOFI stock. Of the 14 analysts covering the stock, only five recommend a Buy, six rate it as a Hold, and three suggest a Sell, resulting in an overall Hold consensus according to TipRanks. The average SOFI stock price target is $8.27, almost 5% lower than the recent market price. In summary, despite short-term challenges and cautious analyst sentiment, SoFi’s strong revenue growth, improving profitability, and strategic diversification make a compelling case for growth at a reasonable valuation for long-term investors. With a rapidly expanding member base and a digital-first strategy, I believe the company is well-positioned to thrive in the evolving fintech landscape. This warrants a bullish sentiment for SOFI stock at current prices. Disclosure Disclaimer ",

China's finance minister has called a fiscal policy briefing for Saturday against a backdrop of high expectations and jittery trade. Investors and, as of Thursday, Swedish furniture shop IKEA want fiscal stimulus to reinvigorate the economy. Markets are expecting Beijing to announce 2 trillion to 3 trillion yuan ($280-$420 billion) in new spending, and worries about whether it will deliver - after a similar disappointment from policymakers' briefing early this week - had Chinese equities falling on Friday. On the geopolitical front, Israel is mulling its response to an Iranian missile attack, and a retaliatory strike on oil or military targets would likely draw a sharp reaction in financial markets. Investors in Asia were taking chips off the table. Chinese stocks are set for a weekly drop as follow-up details on promises to support the economy have so far underwhelmed. Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday on Friday, leaving the Hang Seng nursing its largest weekly drop in two years as investors hit pause on one of its sharpest ever rallies. Gold was creeping higher. British monthly GDP data is due in the European session and, while it is hard to really gauge growth from monthly figures, signs of strength in the services sector may have investors dialling back expectations for interest rate cuts. Markets price about a 3/4 chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in November, while opinions at the Bank of England itself are also divided. Rate cuts should come gradually, BoE chief economist Huw Pill told the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last week, a day after Governor Andrew Bailey was quoted in the Guardian saying the central bank could move aggressively. Among U.S. earnings, J.P. Morgan, BNY and Wells Fargo are due before the open. Tesla shares may react to the long-awaited showcase of an autonomous taxi in Los Angeles, which came with fanfare but few details on timing. Production is not set to begin until 2026. U.S. producer prices data is also due and will frame expectations for the Federal Reserve's preferred PCE measure out later in the month. Slightly stronger-than-expected inflation in September has, for now, knocked out market expectations of anything more than a 25 bp interest rate cut at the Fed's November meeting.

Recommended Reading Weis Markets buys 2 supermarkets LAS VEGAS — Weis Markets was initially skeptical when Amazon came to it with a plan to fulfill delivery orders for the chain. But the grocer’s decision to accept the proposal has turned out to benefit the East Coast supermarket chain on several fronts, the company’s chief information officer said. The relationship with Amazon has helped Weis improve its in-store operations, gain more insight into its e-commerce business and reach shoppers in areas beyond the reach of its brick-and-mortar stores, Greg Zeh, senior vice president and CIO of Weis Markets, said during a Monday panel session at Groceryshop. “When Amazon approached us about becoming a grocery partner, they kind of gave us an idea [of] what they thought that sales volume might be, and we kind of looked at them … sideways and said, ‘We’re not sure if that makes sense or not,’” Zeh said. Weis is currently working with Amazon to service orders from 23 sites that represent 75% of the grocer’s footprint. Amazon can handle deliveries to customers living within a 52-minute radius of Weis’ stores, Zeh said. Weis has been able to tap Amazon’s e-commerce expertise to bring “some very good discipline to the organization” and help Weis’ team sharpen its ability to manage online orders, Zeh said. In an example of that, Weis workers have used metrics provided by Amazon to become more adept at picking products ordered by online shoppers, Zeh said. Weis is currently working with Amazon to service orders from 23 sites that represent 75% of the grocer’s footprint. Amazon can handle deliveries to customers living within a 52-minute radius of Weis’ stores, Zeh said. Zeh noted that third-party delivery providers account for about two-thirds of its e-commerce sales volume, with Amazon handling about a quarter of that business. Weis also works with e-commerce companies including Instacart, DoorDash, Uber Eats and Shipt. Weis, which is based in Pennsylvania and runs about 200 stores in seven states, has also been able to add shoppers in markets that were beyond its reach before it joined forces with Amazon, giving it an opportunity to add customers in more metropolitan areas to its footprint, Zeh said. That could help Weis build its e-commerce volume to the point that it might consider investing in micro-fulfillment equipment, he added.    ",

After a hot jobs report and a consumer inflation reading that didn’t put to bed concerns about rising prices, there’s more confusion than usual about what the Federal Reserve will do next with rates. Hopes for China stimulus and its ripple effect have sprung up, but the picture there remains murky as well, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in Chinese stocks. Throw in a couple of literal hurricanes and a figurative one in the Mideast, and investors have a lot to weigh when making decisions. Oh, and one more thing — the presidential election. Election years tend to be tough on October stock returns. “An upcoming US Election, a surprise stimulus from China and a broadening Middle East conflict will continue to exaggerate the Macro, and its very uncertain uncertainties, over Micro this Earnings season,” Evercore ISI’s Julian Emanuel wrote in a recent note to clients.

Indeed, as earnings reports start to roll out, first from the banks today and then broadening out next week, Bank of America thinks investors will be looking past the current noise. “I think this earnings season is going to be pretty tricky,” Ohsung Kwon, US and Canada equity strategist at Bank of America, said in a recent interview. “I don't think the big focus is on Q3. Everyone basically knows that Q3 wasn't a very strong macro environment … So I don't think the bar is that high, but also the focus isn't really about Q3. It's really about companies' outlook on the other side of the curve. Now that the easing cycle has started, what are companies going to say about any early indications of improvement given the lower rate environment?” All of that said, stocks could still benefit from estimate-beating numbers and raised forecasts, Kwon wrote in a note to investors. He expects earnings for the S&P 500 to have risen 4% year over year in the third quarter, a sharp slowdown from the 11% gain in the second. (Evercore puts the predicted gain at 6.5%). Wherever the various strategists’ forecasts land, “As long as companies have managed through macro headwinds and see early signs of improvement from lower rates, stocks should get rewarded,” Kwon wrote.

This year, Oct. 14 is the second Monday of October, the date that Columbus Day is celebrated in the U.S., meaning you may be wondering if stock markets will be open for trading. Considering the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq largely follow the calendar of federal holidays for closures, it may come as a surprise that both will be open and operating normally on Monday.

This product aligns with the company's strategy to generate recurring revenue and is expected to be compatible with various life-support machines, potentially addressing the $1bn perfusion systems market. The disposable kit is a single-use product that alerts medical teams to any changes in performance during operation and treatment. Its unique design is intended to offer a smart, adaptable experience for users. Inspira Technologies co-founder and CEO Dagi Ben-Noon said: “This new innovation and capability, being integrated into our disposable kit, is expected to be an additional step by Inspira to provide new technologies and user experiences for the purpose of supporting improved safety and patient care.” Inspira is preparing to submit an application for US FDA clearance to market the disposable kit. Upon approval, the kit will be available for hospitals using the INSPIRA ART100 system. The ART100 system received FDA 510(k) clearance for cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in May this year. The company expects the first devices to be deployed in the US by the end of 2024. Inspira received approval from the Israeli Ministry of Health for its INSPIRA ART100 system in July this year. The company has developed INSPIRA ART with the aim of transforming the $19bn mechanical ventilation market. INSPIRA ART features the clip-on HYLA blood sensor, a real-time continuous monitoring technology that alerts physicians to patient condition changes without needing blood samples, helping them make informed decisions. \"Inspira develops new disposable kit for perfusion market\" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.

That pushed its total gain since inception seven years ago to 825%, according to data compiled by Shenzhen PaiPaiWang Investment & Management Co., which tracks Chinese hedge funds. Chinese tech stocks have soared since the government announced an economic stimulus package, fueling gains at long-only hedge funds like Huaan Hexin that have placed heavy bets on a sector once favored by short sellers. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks 30 Chinese tech firms traded in Hong Kong, surged more than 50% since mid-September before paring gains this week. “The market is just rebounding from an extremely bearish level to a level that’s still undervalued,” Yuan said. While further upside partly depends on the effects of the stimulus measures on the economy, internet firms have seen turning points in profitability since last year, he said. The boost from an improving industry environment can offset any pressure on earnings from the economic slowdown, rendering firms like Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan “safe havens,” he added. “Their profit elasticity by far exceeds the impact from macroeconomic volatilities,” Yuan said. “And if the economy improves, they benefit as well.” Yuan said his positions are primarily in Hong Kong-traded stocks and mostly held since last year, without providing details. The company has recently started buying shares of a Chinese manufacturing firm due to its growth prospects and low valuations, he said, declining to name the target.          "

        "body": "Hurricane Milton struck Florida's central west coast as a dangerous Category 3 storm on Oct. 9. As Floridians braced for the hurricane's landfall, airlines canceled hundreds of flights and cruise lines shifted routes. At least 16 cruise ships are directly affected, and some cruises advised that they did not expect to be able to return to port until Oct. 12, Florida's Maritime Executive newspaper reported. The Florida cruise industry is just entering its busy season, which generally aligns with winter as travelers from colder regions, especially the northern U.S. and Canada, flock south to warmer weather and the Caribbean. Despite the disruptions, analysts remain optimistic about the cruise industry’s resilience, lifting stock price targets for the major cruise lines. Cruise lines were particularly vulnerable when operations were halted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, analysts are seeing growth driven by strong demand from U.S. customers, who continue to travel despite economic uncertainties. Image source: Dan Kline/Come Cruise With Me Citigroup on Oct. 9 updated share-price targets on Carnival  (CCL) , Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The analyst is optimistic that the cruise-sector rally will extend into 2025 and beyond, thefly.com reported. All three stocks are up more than 20% in the past month. Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian Cruise Line are the biggest market players in the cruise line industry. According to Cruise Market Watch, in 2024 Carnival and its sub-brands accounted for 37.3% of the industry’s revenue, with Royal Caribbean Group at 23.9% and Norwegian at 14.1%. Citi raised its price target on Carnival to $28 from $25 and affirmed a buy rating on the shares. Related: Analysts retool Carnival stock price targets ahead of earnings The analyst said Carnival has strong potential for revenue growth, citing recent positive trends in the company’s performance and the anticipated benefits from assets like Celebration Key, the line’s new private island destination in the Bahamas. Celebration Key is set to open in July. On Sept. 30, Carnival reported that for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31, net income surged 60% from a year earlier to $1.7 billion as revenue increased 14% to $7.9 billion. Citi also says Carnival could sacrifice sales growth and focus on reducing debt and interest payments. Although Carnival has posted impressive financial results, it remains burdened by substantial debt. Carnival’s debt reached its peak at $35.14 billion in Q1 2023. As of Aug. 31, it still has nearly $29 billion in total debt. But if interest rates ease, Carnival could benefit from reduced debt repayments, particularly when it refinances or issues new debt.                  ",

Of the top ten brands, Jeep demonstrated the standout growth in BEV retail sales with a staggering 420% increase in new registrations, albeit from a low baseline in 2023. Close behind was BMW, with a 402% increase, establishing itself as a premium competitor to Tesla. Conversely, MG faced significant challenges, seeing the largest market decline at 46%. Tesla, despite retaining its position as the third best-selling brand, experienced a 40% year-on-year drop, falling behind Peugeot and Renault in their home market. However, 2024 has been less favourable for the Model Y, with new registrations down by 34% as of August, leading to a decline in market share to 8%. Despite these challenges, it remains the second most popular BEV model in France, just behind the Peugeot 208. To counter this trend, Tesla launched short-term finance offers for September 2024, including easy lease and classic credit options, to stimulate demand and clear inventory before the anticipated arrival of a refreshed Model Y in the first half of 2025. This strategic move also aimed to clear inventory build-up of the current Model Y versions in September, with a view to closing the order books for the third quarter of 2024 on a strong note. It also reflected anticipation of the arrival of the restyled Model Y next year. Tesla’s headline LOA (easy lease) offer, which gave the customer a purchase option if they wished to own the vehicle, started at a monthly payment rate of €299 per month with an OEM discount, or ‘Tesla bonus’, of €4,000. This discount was on top of the €4,000 ecological bonus available from the government for qualifying versions.

        "body": " Most exchange-traded fund investors say that economic and political events such as high inflation and the election have had no effect on how they invest in ETFs, according to a new report by Charles Schwab Asset Management. ETF investors are more enthusiastic about tech and growth stocks than they were last year. Younger generations of investors are more likely than older generations to express interest in investments like crypto and alternative ETFs. Millennials also want to increase their allocation to fixed-income ETFs.  Market volatility, high interest rates, inflation and the upcoming presidential election haven't affected the investment strategies of most exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. Most ETF investors surveyed by Charles Schwab (SCHW) Asset Management said that these economic and political events did not change the way they invest in ETFs. In fact, roughly a third of the investors put more money into ETFs based on their reading of stock market volatility, high interest rates and persistent inflation, according to the survey results released this week. ETFs have a track record across market cycles, said David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Innovation and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, adding that \"investors are confident in their investments even when the outlook is uncertain.” ETF investors have grown more bullish on certain types of stocks and sectors since last year: 69% are bullish on technology and 60% on growth stocks. Additionally, 55% of investors are optimistic about the the Magnificent 7, a group of seven mega-cap technology companies including Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). The Mag 7 stocks have a big influence on the stock markets and have driven much of the S&P 500's returns over the past year. But when they falter, as they did in July this year, they tend to drag the broader stock market down with them. The survey also showed how investment preferences vary across generations. For instance, 62% of millennials (or those born between 1981 and 1996), said they plan to invest in cryptocurrency ETFs over the next year versus 15% of Boomers (or those born between 1946 and 1964). A quarter of millennials said they plan to invest in alternatives ETFs, compared with just 11% of boomers. At the same time, 44% of millennials also want to increase their exposure to lower-risk fixed income ETFs. In contrast, fewer GenX (34%) and Boomer (26%) investors plan to do likewise.   ",

The company expects third-quarter net revenue of $302 million – $309 million versus the consensus of $289.37 million. Also, Indivior trimmed its FY24 net revenue outlook to $1.125 billion – $1.165 billion (consensus $1.185 billion) from $1.15 billion – $1.215 billion. In particular, the company now expects lower-than-anticipated net revenue for SUBLOCADE, with projected net revenue of $187 million – $192 million in the third quarter and $725 million – $745 million (versus $765 million to $805 million expected earlier) for FY24. Mark Crossley, CEO of Indivior, stated, “We are seeing faster than expected initial adoption of the competitive product to SUBLOCADE. This dynamic, together with greater variability in the timing of funding among Criminal Justice System customers, as well as incremental trade stocking pressure, has resulted in net revenue below our expectations set out in July. We are reducing our FY 2024 guidance to reflect these impacts.” Also, looking to the year ahead, the company expects pressure on SUBLOCADE volume growth from continued initial competitor adoption as the U.S. market adjusts to two long-acting injectable products. Indivior maintained its expectation for peak net revenue from SUBLOCADE to exceed $1.5 billion but no longer anticipates a run rate of $1 billion by the end of 2025. Crossle added, “We remain firm in our conviction that SUBLOCADE has a differentiated and optimal profile for opioid use disorder (OUD) patients, including our belief that it will best meet the increasing challenges that synthetic opioids are presenting to OUD patients and treatment providers.” ”Additionally, we expect SUBLOCADE’s profile to be further enhanced with important label updates in February 2025 that, if approved by the FDA, are expected to improve both the patient and healthcare provider experience.” Apart from this, the company reiterated outlook for an adjusted gross margin in low to mid 80% range and lowered adjusted operating profit guidance to $260 million – $280 million (from $285 million – $320 million) for 2024.

DUBAI — Crypto exchange OKX has gone live in the UAE offering a dirham (AED)-denominated order book and integration with a local bank as it looks to attract retail clients and entice institutions that may have been reluctant to participate in the crypto market. The opening, nine months after OKX Middle East Fintech FZE was granted full regulatory approval by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), will allow one of the four biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume to offer local residents access to a market without involving a broker who buys liquidity from outside the UAE, usually at a higher price, adding time and friction, said Rifad Mahasneh, the exchange's general manager for the Middle East. \"We have two targets – to be the retail app of choice and market and to start converting institutions in the UAE to enter the space,\" Mahasneh said in an interview. \"The return on investment is going to come from our ability to convert traditional institutions.\" The combination of giving access to a regulated derivatives product, local-currency product and local banking channel could give entities representing global institutions, which have so far been sitting on the sidelines, comfort to trade, Mahasneh said. The company's banking partner is Zand Bank, which calls itself the UAE's first fully licensed, all-digital bank. OKX is the first major exchange to go live with the combination of \"an AED banking integration and an AED order book,\" retail and institutional availability, and the first to offer regulated derivatives in the market, Mahasneh said. It will offer 280 tokens and 400 trading pairs in the region. Binance and Crypto.com are the other major international exchanges with full licenses from VARA. After announcing a partnership with Standard Chartered in August, Crypto.com's retail app is now available in the UAE, the company told CoinDesk in an email. Binance did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment about whether it had gone live in the UAE. VARA's public register shows OKX's license was issued Sept. 17. \"While that's VARA reflecting it's confident of you as a firm to operate in this space, the license comes with certain conditions that you need to complete before you go live,\" Mahasneh said. \"We wanted to test the product too.

Nvidia's Blackwell GPU is on schedule and is sold out for the next 12 months, the company said. Inference computing growth boosts the long-term demand potential for Nvidia's AI GPU chips. Nvidia stock is poised for more gains as its GPU chip business continues to see surging demand. That's according to Morgan Stanley, which hosted meetings with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and other members of the chip maker's management team for three days in New York City this week. The key takeaway is that \"every indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said. The bank reiterated its \"Overweight\" and \"Top Pick\" ratings and $150 price target, representing potential upside of 12% from current levels. Moore said Nvidia's production ramp of its next-generation Blackwell GPU chip is \"progressing on schedule,\" adding that the product is sold out for the next 12 months. \"Any new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor through the year,\" Moore explained. Hopper is Nvidia's previous generation of AI-enabled GPU chips, which are being sold in clusters to cloud \"hyperscalers\" like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. And Nvidia has a new \"element\" to its story, according to Moore, which is the view that inference computing \"is starting to solve much more complex problems which will require a much richer mix of hardware.\" That should be a boon for Nvidia's GPU chip product set, according to the note. \"The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of \"digital AI employees\" that can execute challenging tasks,\" Moore said. He added: \"The notion that a more thoughtful, task oriented inference would cause an exponential jump in inference complexity strikes us an important new avenue for growth, and another clear area where NVIDIA's full stack approach to solving these problems adds to the company's considerable lead.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made it clear to Morgan Stanley that the company expects to see meaningful growth in 2025 that spills over into 2026, \"though he did not quantify,\" Moore said.

Most Read from Bloomberg San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures expected one-month volatility on the S&P 500 Index, reached about 14 points above the 10-day realized volatility. It’s a level that’s only been exceeded for extended periods in 2008 and 2020-2021 during times when the market was recovering from severe selloffs as a result of the Global Financial Crisis and Covid. Robert Knopp, co-head of the S&P options desk at Optiver in Chicago, said upcoming events such as the US presidential election and earnings season are contributing to the spread. “While recent realized volatility is often predictive of upcoming realized volatility, in this case, these events are contributing to expectations of higher volatility,” he wrote. And while the divergence is not totally uncommon, the timing is. Usually the two measures have a bigger positive gap when tensions in the market are rising and the VIX Index is trading at higher levels. Even though the VIX has increased from the low levels seen from mid-2023 through mid-July, it’s just around the five-year average. Since the market volatility spike in early August, Knopp said there’s been a “combination of greater demand for hedging together with less willingness from market participants to warehouse short-volatility positions at the same levels that we observed prior to August 5.” Some of the early-October increase of about 5 points in the VIX to above 20 may be mechanical, as S&P options around the Nov. 5 US election day became part of the index’s calculation. But it also signals investors are seeking some protection, with looming risks from geopolitical tension to interest rates, macro economic concerns and the upcoming earnings season, in addition to the presidential election. The S&P 500 Index, however, has been little changed as the benchmark consolidates near all-time highs. “Generally, a larger gap is often a bullish signal over medium-term horizons, like three to six months,” said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. “This is because the market tends to price in rising volatility risk, which often doesn’t materialize. The eventual resolution of these events could reduce volatility, leading to positive market returns.”        "

The data do not include sales by Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Tesla and Nissan and a growing number of Chinese brands that have entered the market in the last two years, as well as domestic electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast. The market expanded for the sixth consecutive month in September from very weak year-earlier levels, after eighteen months of almost incessant declines. Heavy discounting by dealers helped support the market last month, as did the 50% vehicle registration tax discount introduced by the government in September and effective for three months. Third-quarter GDP growth came in at 7.4% year-on-year, up from 6.9% in the second quarter, driven by strong industrial output and exports - despite a series of powerful typhoons hitting the country in the last two months causing widespread damage and flooding. VAMA’s member data shows the market expanded by 2% to 193,854 units in the first nine month of 2024 from 190,130 a year earlier, including a 1% decline in passenger vehicle sales to 142,910 units while commercial vehicle sales increased by 12% to 50,944 units. Truong Hai (Thaco) group, the local assembler and distributor of several overseas brands and a major player in the commercial vehicle segment, reported a 10% drop in group sales to 60,546 units year-to-date. This includes an 18% drop in Kia sales to 22,948 units and an 11% fall in Mazda sales to 21,274 units, while sales of Thaco commercial vehicle increased by 6% to 12,858 units. Toyota’s nine-month volumes increased by 5% at 40,503 units, with sales of the Hilux pickup truck being stepped up in recent months. Ford, saw its sales rise by 6% to 28,038 units - underpinned by the popular Ranger, Everest and Transit models; while Mitsubishi’s sales increased by 29% to 27,933 units - lifted by the launch of the XForce SUV at the beginning of the year; followed by Honda with 17,654 units (+17%); and Suzuki with 7,985 units (-26%). The latest data released by Hyundai’s local distributor showed 34,389 vehicles were sold under the South Korean brand in the first eight months of 2024. VinFast said its global sales increased by 92% year-on-year to 21,747 units in the first half of 2024 and confirmed it is targeting 80,000 sales over the full year – in a growing number of markets in South-east Asia and the Middle-East as well as in the US. The Vietnamese government confirmed it will keep the registration tax for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) at 0% until 2026 while the special consumption tax will be kept at between 1% and 3%, as part of a broader package of incentives aimed at attracting BEV sector investment into the country – including cuts in import duties on components and charging equipment.

        "body": "By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors will be looking for evidence that investment in artificial intelligence among S&P 500 companies is beginning to pay off as the reporting season progresses, despite the fact that analysts expect profit growth to decelerate from the previous quarter. S&P 500 earnings are estimated to have increased 5.3% over the year-ago quarter, down from a second-quarter gain of 13.2%, but technology and communication services sectors are forecast to have the strongest year-over-year growth, according to LSEG data as of Friday. The earnings period unofficially kicks off this week, with reports from major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo due Friday. AI-related companies have dominated earnings since last year, and optimism over AI plans have helped to drive strong gains in the market. The S&P 500 is at record high levels and up roughly 21% for the year so far, with tech and communication services leading sector gains since Dec. 31. \"Many analysts will start looking at how and if a lot of these larger companies can monetize the model that they're training, and we've seen the ones that have been able to do so have been rewarded quite well,\" said Howard Chan, chief executive officer of Kurv Investment Management in San Francisco. Technology sector earnings in aggregate are expected to have gained 15.4% from the year-ago quarter, while communication services earnings are seen up 12.3%, based on LSEG data. Shares of Meta Platforms jumped on Aug. 1, a day after it issued an upbeat sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its AI investments. \"Companies like Microsoft and Google, they're spending quite a bit, but it's a little bit less understood... how that will interplay with their existing businesses,\" Chan said. Investors may also be hoping earnings can justify higher stock prices. With the S&P 500 at record high levels, the index is now trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note Wednesday that third-quarter results could provide a catalyst for gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. \"We continue to favor the semiconductor space and megacaps for AI exposure,\" she wrote, noting that she expects tech and AI companies to beat results for the quarter ended in September and also raise their outlooks.

Orano is also developing new projects in Mongolia and Uzbekistan, while remaining “in monitoring mode” for potential acquisitions, he said. “We have interest in diversifying our projects as there are some tensions in the East and in Africa,” Maes said at the company’s uranium enrichment plant in central France. “Questions over where uranium will come from in the next decade are pulling prices higher.” Uranium has soared over the past three years as investors piled into the commodity and governments from China to Europe plan more nuclear power plants, partly to curb carbon emissions. At the same time, production issues in Kazakhstan and a military coup in Niger have impacted uranium output.

That production can’t be exported out of the landlocked African nation due to persisting geopolitical issues, he added. The cost of enriching uranium — a key step to transform the radioactive metal into fuel — has also jumped since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as some western utilities seek to replace Kremlin-controlled Rosatom for their processing requirements. To help fill that gap, Orano broke ground on the expansion of its French enrichment facility this year. It expects to boost its global market share of enrichment services to 16% from 12%, when the project is completed by the end of the decade, the CEO said. Rosatom is the world’s largest enricher of uranium, with 43% of total production capacity, according to Orano. That’s followed by Urenco Ltd., a UK-Dutch-German group with a 31% share, and China National Nuclear Corp. with 13%.          "

Investors also channelised capital into liquid money market funds as they awaited a much-anticipated update on Beijing's stimulus measures this weekend. According to LSEG data, global money market funds gained a net $24.55 billion worth of inflows during the week after witnessing about $22.78 billion of net purchases in the prior week. Investors readjusted their views on future Fed rate cuts last week following a stronger than expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for the last month, boosting demand for low-risk assets. Asian money market funds saw a significant $12.88 billion inflow, the highest since Jan. 10. European and U.S. funds also witnessed $7.78 billion and $2.54 billion worth of net purchases, respectively. Demand for riskier equity funds, however, cooled as investors purchased just $3.65 billion of global equity funds compared with $35.97 billion of net acquisitions in the prior week. Tech, financials, and metals and mining sector funds received a notable $572 million, $417 million and $148 million, respectively, while the healthcare sector suffered $520 million worth of net sales. Overseas China equity funds attracted a sharp $8.52 billion, the biggest amount for a week since at least December 2020. Global bond funds attracted investments for the 42nd consecutive week as investors pumped $12.43 billion into these funds. Investors snapped up short-term bond funds of a net $2.16 billion following $3.3 billion of net sales a week ago.

Boeing had roughly 171,000 employees as of December 2023, according to an SEC filing. \"We've got an aircraft manufacturer that's in very, very deep trouble. What they did here is not a drill,\" Mike Boyd, president of aviation consulting firm Boyd Group International, told Yahoo Finance on Friday following the job cut announcement. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. The work stoppage has interrupted the company's recovery efforts, which include ramping up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets to 38 per month by the end of the year, up from roughly 25 per month in June and July. Estimates from S&P Global put the cost of the strike at roughly $1 billion per month after taking into consideration cost-saving measures the company has taken in response to it. Earlier this week, the credit rating agency placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the work stoppage continues until the end of the year. Riskier credit makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to borrow money. S&P expects Boeing will incur a cash outflow of approximately $10 billion in 2024. As a result, Wall Street analysts expect Boeing will need to raise cash through an equity offering. At the end of the second quarter, Boeing had roughly $58 billion in total debt and $12.6 billion in cash. “Based on our conversations with investors, it should be no surprise that Boeing is looking at an equity raise. We think most investors have been expecting the company to raise more than $10B, most likely following the conclusion of the machinists strike,\" JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman and his team wrote in a recent note. The analysts note the size of the raise could be determined by how long the strike lasts, and investors would be more reluctant to sign on with one still underway.             ",

Projects in the space are creating technologies that stand to change, at least to a degree, the reigning cloud computing model, while providing users with sustainable economic incentives to uphold the networks. This could be the basis for new models of economic development. The decentralization of cloud computing is the creation of a two-sided marketplace. Node networks, the most common infrastructure underpinning DePIN projects, are an efficient and secure way for users to actually own parts of the network. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure. Physical assets like telecom infrastructure or video streaming networks can be divided up, apportioned and owned by node owners for a small profit. Users then pay to access that network that is sustained by the many, instead of owned by the few. We need to consider the importance of node operators to a local economy and local innovations. DePIN networks might actually enable the little guy to win, for once. For example, Helium’s network is being deployed for livestock tracking in Africa, helping to protect endangered species while supporting farmers’ livelihoods. Helium CEO Abhay Kumar CEO noted that: \"The cow in this case, or the livestock in this case, is sort of the center of the economy for this community.” Indeed, this is a local innovation born from DePIN. In the emerging markets, physical infrastructure is unreliable or even nonexistent. Those markets therefore stand to be the first mover of mass adoption of decentralized networks of nodes. This is because nodes can be a small business, akin to operating a produce stall or a bicycle repair shop. So we need to think of nodes as “micro businesses franchises” rather than an immediate cypherpunk global revolution in radical decentralization. DePIN is not a crypto gimmick; it’s actually a small business for node operators New ideas take time. Yet, technology is often adopted much faster in the emerging markets. Banking adoption in Africa skipped internet banking and went straight to mobile banking. Localized innovations meant African payments and credit business models emerged. This is how we should think about DePIN, a slow revolution that the big tech giants won’t see coming as it emerges gradually through various local drivers in certain geographies. Drivers such as the utility of operating a computing node as a small business. The DePIN supply-side business model is already slowly changing how we think about ownership of physical infrastructure networks. Still, on the demand side for Westerners this might not yet be a revolutionary moment. I’ll just stick with Zoom or Telegram and rely on AWS Cloud, thanks. Just a side hustle for Western node operators, this could be a personal finance game changer for node operators in emerging markets.              "

Guests were soaking up the atmosphere, and paying millions for the works on display. At Frieze Masters, where the focus is on historic rather than contemporary art, Hauser & Wirth sold an Édouard Manet painting for 4.5 million euros; a Francis Picabia work for $4 million, and an Arshile Gorky oil painting called “The Opaque” for $8.5 million “Our theme is quality, and the pieces we have are part of art history, as well as the history of our culture. We’ve observed that there’s a growing interest in quality,” said Carlo Knöll, senior director at the Swiss gallery, which counts Princess Eugenie as a director. Gallerists said the fair is able to attract a diverse international crowd. “There were far more people in town from abroad than [anticipated]. It’s nice to see that London is still very much on the map,” said Alison Jacques, whose eponymous gallery had booths at Frieze London and Frieze Masters. Jacques said a group of works from young artist Sophie Birber was sold, with prices rang from 9,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds. The gallery also sold a painting from Nicola L. for $125,000 and a piece from Ana Mendieta sold for $75,000. Lisa De Simone, a representative from Elliott Fine Art, said “the beauty of London is that it’s a true melting pot. We’ve talked to people from so many different regions such as Europe, North and South America and Asia.” The gallery put a focus on female artists who have been previously neglected in history, but who are now being rediscovered, and celebrated. The works of Françoise Gilot, Giovanna Garzoni and Suzanne Fabry were on display, with the latter’s “Triple self portrait” selling for 50,000 pounds.

With Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a close race to win the Nov. 5 election, we look at what matters most for world markets. EUROPE IN THE BALANCE For European equity markets, a Trump victory could spell trouble for export-heavy sectors, particularly German automakers such as BMW but also LVMH and other luxury goods makers as concerns of renewed trade tensions loom. Barclays has warned of possible \"high single-digit\" percentage drops in European earnings should trade conflicts reignite. Trump has floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10-20% on virtually all imports to boost U.S. manufacturing. On the flip side, a Harris win would be a relatively better outcome for European equities. This could energize renewable energy, a possible tailwind for utilities with large U.S. projects like Orsted and Iberdrola. Over the longer term, however, her plans to raise corporate taxes from 21% to 28% could curb margins for American firms and European dollar earners alike. A further cut under Trump would likely be welcomed on both sides of the Atlantic. The election could have implications for the war in Ukraine. Trump and some Republicans in Congress have questioned the value of U.S. funding for Ukraine's two-year battle against Russia, while Democrats have pushed to bolster Ukraine. Aerospace and defense stocks have gained over 80%since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. CURRENCY SWINGS Trade tariffs are key for traders in the world's most-actively traded currencies. The euro, trading below September's 14-month peaks at around $1.09, is seen as being in the losing camp if a Trump win means higher universal tariffs. \"A Trump win, in the eyes of the market, would take euro/dollar down to the $1.05 area, whereas a win for Harris would see the rate move in the opposite direction, above $1.15,\" said BlueBay Asset Management CIO Mark Dowding. Geopolitical risks, especially in the Middle East, that trigger a surge in oil prices and hurt economic growth, also make the euro vulnerable, analysts said. ING added that a Trump win could also hurt the Australian and New Zealand dollars -- currencies of economies dependent on trade from China, a main target of higher tariffs. Around 37% of Australia's and 29% of New Zealand’s exports land in China, ING noted. The Swedish and Norwegian currencies were also seen as vulnerable to global trade dynamics, while Canada's dollar could suffer if a Harris win is viewed negatively for the U.S. economy.

        "body": "Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell by about 2.7% in overnight trading on brokerage firm Robinhood after the company’s robotaxi unveiling event late on Thursday failed to give investors confidence. What Happened: Tesla on Thursday unveiled a two-seater Cybercab that can drive itself and a robovan with no pedals that can accommodate about 20 passengers at an event in Los Angeles on Thursday. The event, however, was thin on details with the company not divulging the cost of the robovan. Musk also said that the smaller Cybercab will join the company’s autonomous taxi fleet only by 2026. The CEO further remarked that he is often optimistic about timelines, hinting at chances of delay. Don’t Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. Why It Matters: Tesla investors were hoping the robotaxi unveiling event would give the stock a much-needed boost after the company’s third-quarter delivery numbers announced earlier this month sent the stock on a downward journey. Tesla delivered 462,890 vehicles in the third quarter, marking an increase of 6.4% from the corresponding period last year, but below estimates. The company has previously said that it expects a lower delivery growth rate this year as compared to the last. However, it has not issued specific delivery guidance for the year. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Some analysts, including Deepwater Asset Management's Managing Partner Gene Munster, had expected Tesla to unveil a cheaper, mass-market EV at the event on Thursday in addition to the robotaxi to ramp delivery numbers in the coming year. Price Action: At the time of writing, the Tesla stock was down by 2.7% on overnight trading on Robinhood. Year-to-date, Tesla shares are down nearly 4%, after the stock closed down 0.95% at $238.77 on Thursday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The population of the city stood at 59,471 in 2023, representing a 2.7% increase from the prior year and 9.8% jump from 2020, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Bentonville is located in Northwestern Arkansas, a fast-growing region where companies like Walmart, J.B. Hunt and Tyson Foods all have their headquarters. A forecast from the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission suggested over 1 million could call Northwest Arkansas home by 2050.

Read On The Fox Business App \"We’re the home of Walmart, and we’re the home of J.B. Hunt and also the home of Tyson, and Walmart has spent a ton of energy in making this a very recruitable place,\" The Agency Bentonville Managing Partner Kaala House told FOX Business. \"Our market is growing so intensely, especially starting after COVID because a lot of people wanted to get out of the city where they could be outside and things like that. We have become, in the last couple years, we’ve become the mountain biking capital of the United States in Bella Vista. And so that’s making us extremely recruitable for Walmart, who’s bringing back their employees as well.\" The real estate market around Bentonville has seen an 8.5% increase in home sales in the first half of 2024 from a year ago, The Agency Bentonville agent Katlyn Munch said. Benton County, where Bentonville is located, and two nearby counties notched 4,799 home sales over the first six months of the year, according to a recent Skyline Report from Arvest Bank and the University of Arkansas published online by NWAHomepage. That figure represented a 2.7% rise from the latter half of 2023, the report found. Munch also noted 39.5% of all homes sold were new construction. \"We’re at an all-low inventory rate. There’s a lot of people that are holding on to that COVID two-point interest rate, and so we’ve got a lot of people that are holding their homes that they don’t want to sell because they have such a great rate, and then the prices have gone up so much since that time too,\" House said. \"So we have a lot of new construction inventory right now. I think the average was, if we closed 29 new houses a day, we wouldn’t have enough houses, because we average 37 people-a-day increase in population.\" Bentonville has \"a little bit more\" of a buyer’s market at the moment, she said, citing interest rates, the upcoming election and other factors.

Alongside all the outward cheer, volatility is an equally big story in almost every asset class. Traders, who got blindsided when things turned violently against them in August and September, are piling into hedges — pushing the cost of protection up almost as fast as markets themselves. The rush is creating unusual contours across assets. In one example, volatility indexes in equities and Treasuries just capped two of their bigger weekly advances of the year. The runups left both fear gauges at their highest in more than two decades — when plotted against other periods when the S&P 500 sat at a record. All in, sentiment remains febrile among key constituencies on Wall Street, thanks to next month’s US election, the uncertain Federal Reserve policy trajectory and recent market traumas. “The odds that a low-probability, very bad event will happen are higher,” said Amy Wu Silverman, head of derivatives strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “Post the August VIX spike markets have normalized and made new highs. Yet, the underlying ‘worry’ had remained elevated.” While asset prices frequently rise at times of investor anxiety, the situation now is especially extreme, with bullishness and skepticism both evident in equal parts. The S&P 500 has risen for five straight weeks and in eight of the last nine, closing Friday at its 45th record of the year after earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. topped estimates. US investment-grade bond spreads are the narrowest in more than three years. At the same time, with market plunges of early August and September fresh in traders’ minds, gauges of investor nervousness are flashing readings of caution that are rare during bullish regimes. Both the Cboe Volatility Index in equities and the ICE BofA MOVE Index in Treasuries have risen sharply since the start of the month. A global measure of cross-asset risk kept by Bank of America Corp. has hit the second-highest level of the year — eclipsed by only the early August selloff, which erased trillions of dollars from global share values in a matter of days. The indicator tracks stress across global equities, rates, currencies and commodities and measures future price swings implied by options.                  "

Equity traders worried that the start of Federal Reserve rate cuts would sap bank profits saw things weren’t that bad, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. churning out a surprise increase in net interest income. At Wells Fargo & Co., NII slumped — but the firm expects that drop to be less steep in the last quarter. Each stock rose at least 4.4%, pushing the KBW Bank Index to the highest since April 2022. “We expect earnings season to be solid, including the big banks,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Credit card delinquencies are still very low and increased economic activity should drive bank revenues.” The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, extending gains into a fifth straight week — its longest winning run since May. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1%. The Russell 2000 climbed 2.1%. Tesla Inc. dropped 8.8% after the unveiling of its Robotaxi was light on specifics. Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. jumped over 9.5%. Treasuries saw small moves, with shorter maturities outperforming. A Bloomberg gauge of US bonds posted a fourth straight week of declines. The dollar barely budged, while capping a second consecutive week of gains in anticipation of a slower pace of rate cuts. West Texas Intermediate oil settled below $76 a barrel. “Now that the Fed has started its rate-cutting cycle, the economy should get a further boost from lower interest rates on things like credit card debt and business loans,” said David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management. “As a result, we expect third-quarter earnings results will be consistent with recent, healthy trends.” In non-recessionary scenarios, the S&P 500 rises 17% on average in the 12 months after the Fed starts to cut rates, Lefkowitz noted. He reiterated his S&P 500 price targets of 5,900 and 6,200 for December 2024 and June 2025. Apollo’s Torsten Slok noted that financials have been among top outperformers during the Fed’s rate cutting cycles that end with a “soft landing.”                                           ",

The electric vehicle maker also revealed a larger \"Robovan\" and showcased its Optimus humanoid robot. Analysts had said prior to the event that they expected Tesla could announce a lower-cost vehicle to be released next year, but the company did not mention one.  Tesla (TSLA) shares stumbled Friday morning as markets appeared to be initially unimpressed with the electric vehicle (EV) maker's \"We, Robot\" event last night, which included the unveiling of autonomous taxi and van models. The autonomous taxi, called the \"Cybercab,\" will go into production by 2026 once Tesla has approval from regulators for its full self-driving software, which Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said should be rolled out in California and Texas by next year for its Model 3 and Model Y. At the event, Musk also revealed the \"Robovan,\" a larger autonomous vehicle designed to carry groups of people or cargo, along with showcasing Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot, with some helping serve drinks, dance, and perform other functions. The van and robot have not received official release dates, but Musk had said previously that Optimus would perform tasks in Tesla factories next year and would be sold to other companies in 2026. One factor pressuring Tesla's stock could be that analysts had said they expected the company could reveal a lower-cost vehicle that could be released next year. Wedbush analysts said in a Friday note that the lack of a \"Model 2\" announcement is the \"elephant in the room this morning,\" as they also acknowledged that Musk and Tesla \"ideally\" should have spent more time on details like how the robotaxi network will operate. However, the Wedbush analysts said they would \"be buyers on any weakness this morning\" as they left the \"We, Robot\" event \"more bullish on the Tesla story.\" Bank of America analysts affirmed their \"buy\" rating on Tesla's stock, saying the \"Robotaxi event lived up to the hype.\" Tesla stock has been trending lower since third-quarter deliveries data released last week beat estimates but perhaps by not as wide a margin as investors had hoped. The EV maker faces another catalyst for its shares later this month, when it reports Q3 earnings Oct. 23. Tesla shares, which recently fell back into negative territory for the year, were down more than 8% at $218.81 soon after markets opened Friday.   ",

Recommended Reading United Airlines takes flight with airline industry’s first media network NEW YORK — United Airlines in June unveiled Kinective Media, billed as the airline industry’s first media network. Drawing insights and data from 110 million travelers and 40 million MileagePlus frequent flyers, the offering quickly partnered with brands including Norwegian Cruise Line, Macy’s, Chase United Co-Brand Credit Cards and more. Mike Petrella was hired as managing director of strategic partnerships in September 2023 and has served as a key leader in the development of Kinective Media. Previously, the executive spent 23 years in the same corporate ecosystem, from being the third employee at Advertising.com through acquisitions by AOL and Yahoo. Petrella was “amazed” at how dynamic United was expanding into a white space area as a nearly 100-year-old company. “I thought I was coming into an old school environment, but even our CEO is very forward thinking,” Petrella said. “The way he communicates to his leadership team is very ‘fail first, fail fast, fail forward,’ and I wasn’t expecting that.” Marketing Dive spoke with Petrella between sessions at Advertising Week New York about the lessons he learned from helping stand up a media offering, the need for data privacy legislation and where the media landscape goes from here. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. MIKE PETRELLA: You need buy-in from everyone and I think that was the thing that was most impressive to me with the team. There was a willingness to be educated and influenced. One of my friends gave me the best advice: You may not know all the answers, but you know the questions to ask. You have to educate yourself in terms of the other building blocks. So from a data perspective, where is our data set today, where do we want it to go tomorrow? As we build a sales organization, how do we build in such a manner that is conducive and complementary to what we’ve stood up ahead of their presence? We were smart in terms of the choices we made, because it allowed us to be dynamic and fluid. We didn’t get locked into anything, and that was the key. In this industry, everything changes and nothing changes all at once, but you have to be able to pivot quickly.                  "

The revelation comes following a lawsuit filed in an Illinois district court Thursday evening by crypto derivatives exchange Bitnomial, which sued Wall Street’s top cop over its claim that it has jurisdiction over a planned futures contract that tracks the price of XRP, the seventh-largest digital asset by market cap. Bitnomial, which is regulated by the SEC’s sister agency the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, filed for the XRP US Dollar Futures contract in August following the conclusion of the SEC’s lawsuit against blockchain payments firm Ripple, where a federal judge ruled against the SEC’s claim that XRP is a security. Exodus Donates $1.3M To Crypto Advocacy Group To Aid Election Day Vote Efforts According to Bitnomial’s lawsuit, the SEC contacted the exchange shortly after the filing, claiming that XRP Futures are \"security futures\" that are subject to joint SEC and CFTC jurisdiction, and that Bitnomial would be violating federal securities laws if it proceeded with the listing. The SEC also said Bitnomial would be required to comply with additional requirements before listing XRP Futures, including registering as a national securities exchange. \"The SEC takes the view that the underlying asset, XRP, is an investment contract and, therefore, transactions in XRP constitute a security under the Securities Exchange Act,\" the lawsuit states. \"Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures.\" Read On The Fox Business App The SEC declined to comment. Tether Looks To Revamp Us Image As It Celebrates 10 Years The SEC's claim that XRP futures are securities futures is a further escalation in the turf war between the securities regulator and the commodities regulator, which are currently vying for sole jurisdiction over digital assets. The biggest question remains whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or commodities and, in the absence of a regulatory framework, the status of certain tokens is being decided by the courts. The CFTC currently oversees futures contracts for bitcoin and ether, the only two digital assets the SEC has deemed to be non-securities. In addition to seeking a declaration from a judge that XRP Futures are not securities futures, Bitnomial is asking the court to issue an order that prevents the SEC from claiming authority over XRP Futures and taking any legal action against the exchange related to its product offering.

On Oct. 8, the Financial Times reported that in Guadalajara, Mexico, Foxconn would construct the largest factory focused on producing Nvidia's most advanced artificial-intelligence servers. Foxconn is one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturers and is also a supplier for Apple’s iPhones. 💸 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's FREE daily newsletter 💸 Foxconn will assemble Nvidia’s GB200, a superchip built on its Blackwell architecture, combining two Blackwell graphics-processing units with a Grace central processing unit. This design enables the GB200 to handle intense AI workloads, like real-time processing of trillion-parameter models. Related: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just told investors what’s next for the AI chipmaker \"We're building the largest GB200 production facility on the planet,\" said Benjamin Ting, Foxconn senior vice president for the cloud enterprise solutions business group, Reuters reported. This move indicates a shift in Nvidia's supply chain away from Asia. With the majority of Nvidia's chip production based in the area, investors are worried about geopolitical risks that could hinder Nvidia’s deliveries and revenue. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, said in September that Nvidia can switch to alternative suppliers as it has enough intellectual property. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is now Nvidia’s biggest supplier. “Maybe the process technology is not as great, maybe we won't be able to get the same level of performance or cost, but we will be able to provide the supply,\" Huang said at Goldman Sachs’s Communacopia + Technology Conference. \"And so I think ... in the event anything were to happen, we should be able to pick up and fab it somewhere else,” On Aug. 28, Nvidia released another solid earnings report. For the quarter ended July 28, the company posted adjusted earnings of 68 cents a share, more than double the figure from the year-earlier figure and beating the analyst consensus of 64 cents.

Backed by the rise of artificial intelligence euphoria and a surprisingly resilient US economy, the S&P 500 has gained more than 60% in the past two years and is hovering near an all-time high. Wall Street strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance believe the bull can keep running wild. Barring any unexpected shocks, the path higher appears to be clear, with earnings growth expected to keep accelerating and the economy on seemingly solid footing as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. A bull market for the S&P 500 was officially declared in June 2023 when the index rose 20% from its recent bear market low. History says this bull market still has legs. At two years, the bull market is well shy of the average run of 5.5 years. And the total return thus far, about 60%, is a far cry from the average 180% gain, per research from Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick. In the past few weeks, several Wall Street equity strategists have made the case for the benchmark index to rise further into both year-end and into 2025, supported by accelerating earnings for the S&P 500. \"We continue to be surprised by the strength of market gains and decided yet again that something more than an incremental adjustment was warranted,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski wrote in a September note when raising his year-end price target for the S&P 500 to a Street high of 6,100 from a previous target of 5,600. On Oct. 4, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target to 6,000 and initiated a 12-month target of 6,300. Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin did note, though, that already high valuations could limit the upside for how far the index can reach in 2025. Strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance agreed with Kostin that already stretched valuations present a challenge to how much higher stocks can go. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon noted that dating back to the mid-1960s, the only time valuations have been this stretched on a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio were 2021 and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. \"This would tell you that the bull is much older or somewhat near the end of this life,\" Gordon said. But strategists often warn that a high valuation itself isn't a proper tool for calling the end of a bull market. Stocks can trade at what are considered to be expensive valuations for longer than expected. What that does tell investors is that much of the good news that could push stocks higher might've already been priced in.               ",

        "body": "Boeing has clearly had a turbulent year. From several safety incidents to the Starliner fiasco to bringing in a new CEO amid a massive workers’ strike, the company has endured blow after blow. And now, it appears the aviation giant is bleeding money. As of Sept. 27, the fallout from 33,000 workers striking accounted for a $1 billion reduction in U.S. GDP, according to economic analysis and modeling company IMPLAN. On Tuesday, Boeing suspended its ongoing negotiations with striking workers, accusing the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) of making unreasonable demands and withdrew its previous offer for a 30% pay increase over four years. As a result, Wells Fargo predicts Boeing will sell between $10 billion and $15 billion in new stock to account for lost earnings, according to an analyst note dated Oct. 9. Boeing previously targeted $10 billion in working cash on its balance sheet, and Wells Fargo estimates cash dropped to roughly $8 billion at the end of the third quarter. Boeing declined a request for comment from Fortune about whether the company would sell new stock. A $10 billion cash raise keeps balances above the $10 billion watermark through 2025, “but leaves little room for any further challenges while we don't think [Boeing] wants to go to equity markets twice,” according to the note. Still, Wells Fargo analysts say this leaves Boeing with about $30 billion to $40 billion in net debt. “This financial strain is compounded by the potential for a credit rating downgrade from agencies like S&P, which have already placed Boeing’s debt on watch,” Jon Morgan, CEO of business consultancy Venture Smarter, told Fortune. “Considering these factors, an equity offering seems a plausible step for Boeing to shore up its finances. The company needs to ensure it has sufficient liquidity to deal with the ongoing labor disputes and maintain its operations.” Considering it took 10 days for the union and Boeing to meet at the negotiating table when talks first fell apart on Sept. 27, Wells Fargo expects there may be “one more shot at getting a deal” before Boeing releases its latest earnings on Oct. 23. “We believe [Boeing] would like to reach a deal before raising further cash through an equity offering,” according to the analyst note. Wells Fargo analysts did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment on the exact timing of when we might expect an equity offering. However, Wells Fargo predicts the strike will likely stretch on for most of October, which could hit Boeing for another $2 billion or so in cash.         ",

The research firm CEO said perfect conditions are aligning for additional gains exceeding 50%. Other notable investors have been looking to buy the dip in Chinese stocks amid continued stimulus efforts. China's stock rally isn't over — and the nation could have the perfect cocktail of ingredients to stage a monster run-up over the next year, according to one Wall Street forecaster. Jeff deGraaf, the CEO of Renaissance Macro Research, says he sees China's benchmark stock index climbing to 6,000 over the next year. That implies a 54% increase from the CSI 300's current levels, thanks to the right mix of conditions in Beijing that should power equities higher, he told Bloomberg on Friday. \"Skepticism, valuation, stimulus, momentum and a trend change,\" deGraaf said of China's investing environment, adding that it was \"one of the best set-ups\" he's seen over his 35-year career. Chinese stocks have been on a roller coaster in recent weeks after Beijing announced its latest monetary stimulus package, which included lowering interest rates and pumping the stock market with $114 billion. The package sparked the steepest rally in Chinese stocks since 2008 before it quickly fizzled, a sign investors were disappointed Beijing didn't announce more stimulus measures. Markets, though, are expecting the nation to announce a fresh fiscal stimulus package at a briefing on Saturday, potentially reviving the bull case for stocks. Most investors expect China to add 2 trillion yuan, or $283 billion, in fiscal stimulus through 2025, according to a Bloomberg poll of market participants. \"We see the policy response as self-preservation, a reaction to the weakness and a potential Mario Draghi-esque 'Do what it takes' moment for China,\" deGraaf said, later urging investors to \"keep stops in place\" when betting on Chinese stocks. Other traders on Wall Street have shown interest in buying the dip in Chinese equities, despite fear that Beijing's economic slowdown could stick around. Investors poured a record $39.1 billion into Chinese stock funds in the week ending October 9, according to EPFR Global data cited by Bank of America in a note. \"We buy any China dips,\" BofA strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note. Stimulus efforts will continue to \"be used aggressively to boost domestic animal spirits and demand,\" he added. Additionally, the Shenzhen Huaan Hexin Private Investment Fund Management Co., a Chinese hedge fund up 800% since 2017, also says it's buying the dip in technology stocks listed in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index has dropped 3% over the last five trading days, but is still up 27% from levels at the start of the year.      "

BlackRock has pulled in $360 billion of total net inflows so far this year, surpassing the full-year net flows of 2022 and 2023. BlackRock “sets a high bar we expect few peers are likely to beat,” TD Cowen analysts wrote in a note after the earnings release. Shares of BlackRock rose 3.6% to $990 at 10:29 a.m. in New York. The firm pulled in $5.5 billion of total net flows for alternatives, compared with outflows of $4.2 billion a year ago. It reported $170 billion of illiquid alternative assets. That’s set to surge. After the third quarter ended, the firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, in a deal adding $116 billion of private market assets. BlackRock’s long-term investment funds took in $160 billion net flows in the period, a total that topped the $100 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company also had $61 billion in net flows to cash-management and money-market funds in the period. Operating income rose 26% from a year ago to $2.1 billion. The firm added $2.4 trillion to its total assets over the past 12 months. BlackRock is positioning itself as a single place for global clients to invest across public and private markets. It benefited this year from the surge in stocks and cash beginning to flow into fixed-income and private funds. The S&P 500 Index rose about 5.5% in the third quarter, and investors are betting the Federal Reserve won’t need to cut rates aggressively in the near-term to avoid a recession. BlackRock is in the process of closing a £2.55 billion ($3.3 billion) acquisition of private-markets data firm Preqin. The firm is also signaling that it wants to catch up in the fast-growing market for private credit, recently shaking up the senior executive team of its global private debt business and establishing a direct-lending group. BlackRock is exploring a purchase of HPS Investment Partners that could value the private credit firm in excess of $10 billion, Bloomberg reported this week.           ",

Recommended Reading Nespresso celebrates aluminum in environmental-forward campaign NEW YORK — Environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs are at an inflection point as brands come under pressure from activists to keep out of increasingly politicized areas. Nespresso USA, the Nestlé-owned coffee machine marketer, has stayed the course on making sustainability a core part of its positioning despite the brewing backlash. Last year, the company promoted brand and communications director Jessica Padula to the dual role of vice president of marketing and head of sustainability, a job with duties that can sometimes seem at odds. “You want to force everything into a marketing campaign when, in fact, it really shouldn’t be. Part of my job is actually saying yes or no,” said Padula. “There are things we’re going to communicate and there are some that we’re just going to do and we don’t need to get credit for it right now.” Nespresso, which has not been immune to criticisms over its use of disposable coffee pods, is placing renewed focus on materials in its marketing. A campaign launched during Climate Week NYC in September spotlights Nespresso’s decades-long history of using aluminum packaging, a material that is easier to recycle than plastic but can be energy intensive to produce. The company on Thursday also announced a partnership with Vital Proteins, another B Corp-certified brand, to launch a wellness pack that is being promoted with fitness expert Rad Lopez and Drew Barrymore, who will feature the product on her talk show. Marketing Dive sat down with Padula during Advertising Week New York, at Nespresso’s New York headquarters, to dig deeper on fostering loyalty and navigating the complexity of sustainability in 2024. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. JESSICA PADULA: The topic was about building a brand customers love, which for Nespresso is near and dear to our hearts. I was on a panel with Samsung and Snapchat, well-known consumer-facing brands. I think Nespresso and maybe coffee, as a category, is particularly unique because it’s an everyday consumption moment. If we’re doing it right, we’re being a part of every single day, which is maybe likened to your phone and unlike many other CPG or even FMCG categories. The other piece of Female Quotient that’s really important to us is they’re focused on empowerment and equity. That’s something that, as a purpose-driven brand, we want to over-index in and talk from that lens — not just about our case studies as a business. Consumers don’t always know [about that] and I think that’s a bit of a harder story for us to tell. I’ve been at Nespresso almost nine years, but it has changed significantly. One of the things that’s true — and this actually came up on the panel yesterday — is we’ve always been a direct-to-consumer brand and we’ve always done it in a way that’s high touch, similar to a luxury brand, even though we sell a commodity product. In the past five to 10 years, the capabilities you have with digital, CRM and sophisticated personalization continue to deliver on that luxury expectation. As a DTC brand, we have the benefit of having so much consumer data about what they’re buying, sometimes what they’re consuming if they have a Bluetooth-connected machine, we’re able to start to talk to them as real human beings, not just as a number in our database. We’ve never really sold through third-party retail and trade where there’s this intermediary between you and your end consumer. We’ve always had that one-to-one [relationship], which fundamentally changes our approach to business. It’s funny because it happened at Climate Week and at Adweek’s Brandweek, the same exact conversation around DEI and ESG and how it integrates with marketing strategy. My role continues to be pretty unique in that I lead both marketing and sustainability for the brand. When we talk about sustainability, it’s not like something we just did in the past five years. It’s fundamentally 30 years in the making. We’re working with not just ourselves to try to be sustainable, but a ton of nonprofit partners and NGOs who know how to do things better than we do. We are not farmers, but we need to support farms to make sure that we protect the land and can continue to grow and sell coffee in the future. They go so hand-in-hand, it’s not altruistic. That [backlash] trend doesn’t surprise me because I think there was a wave, post-pandemic, for brands to focus a lot on ESG and DEI, and in some cases that was not authentic to the roots of the company. If you’re able to tell the authentic story, then consumers are looking for values alignment. [Sustainability] doesn't have to be your top-level campaign. [Consumers] have to see that you act that way, and that’s in everything you do beyond marketing campaigns, which is why I think my role connecting the dots between the two can be tricky. I like to say that everything I learned about sustainability, I learned on the job at Nespresso. We’re a B Corp-certified company. That isn’t because we aspired to become B Corp-certified, but rather the actions we’ve taken for 30 years. Sustainability was set up for so long as doing less bad in the world as a business: Offset your emissions and do less harm. Marketing can tell the story of how you move from less bad to more good. The other thing is that a lot of sustainability leaders are not marketers. Many of the things I sat in on during Climate Week were very complex, difficult and technical topics. Because I don’t have a school education in those things, I’ve often had to say: Pause, break it down for me, help me understand. In many ways then, I’m actually like a consumer, because consumers don’t always understand the depth of that unless they’re a very niche audience. As a marketer, I’ve had to challenge myself. Once you get to a certain level in your marketing career, you’re like, “I know how to do this, I just have to stay on top of new technologies and I’m good.” Sustainability has made me stop and have to learn things from the ground up again, but then apply my marketing skills to be able to translate complex topics into something that’s digestible. Anything about Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. It’s funny to think that we expect consumers to understand these things in some ways. I really commend a brand like Allbirds that printed the CO2 emissions on the inside of the shoe. They’re not just trying to get credit for that, they’re trying to teach their consumers. My role is also really focused on the end of life of capsules and machines. I have had to learn so much about how recycling companies make money in the U.S., because we’re trying to motivate the recyclers to accept our capsules into their system so that you can recycle curbside. You can do that in New York. That took an investment with, not just the city of New York — DSNY [NYC Dept. of Sanitation] helped us — but a third-party company that does the recycling for New York City. We have to understand how they make money and what materials are more valuable for them in order to understand where aluminum and coffee grounds might fit into their business model. Maybe I’m silly, but I never thought of recycling as a business. I thought of it as a public service as a consumer. I’ve learned a ton of really technical [information] about how glass, plastic and metal get recycled, how they commingle, what that looks like, and then the business side of waste, which is not something you learn as a marketer but is a whole industry unto itself. It hasn’t changed as much as it’s opened new lines of communication. A good example is our Relove refurbished machine program. We are always looking at the next exciting machine innovation that’s coming out, but one of the questions that may not get asked if you’re purely a marketing or a salesperson on the commercial side is: If someone wants to upgrade their machine, what happens to their old machine? My role has made me connect those dots. I might want to sell [consumers] a new machine and upgrade them, but I also have to think about the end of life of their current machine. Are we serving the customer and are we serving the planet at the end of the day in this consumerism world that we live in? "

Following a rally to all-time highs, the S&P 500 took a breather. While Thursday’s economic figures were not perceived by Wall Street as catastrophic, they certainly highlighted the Fed’s challenge of bringing inflation back to the 2% target without cooling the jobs market too much. And that has added to the debate about the Fed’s next steps. For now, bond traders continued to bet the central bank will reduce the pace of cuts to 25 basis points in November. Three Fed policymakers — John Williams, Austan Goolsbee and Thomas Barkin were unfazed by a higher-than-forecast consumer price index, suggesting officials can continue lowering rates. The outlier was Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal he revealed that, in projections released in September, he had called for one additional quarter-point cut this year. The Fed has two remaining meetings in 2024. “One slightly hotter-than-expected CPI reading doesn’t mean a new wave of inflation has been unleashed, but the fact that it accompanied a jump in weekly jobless claims may add to short-term market uncertainty,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “These weren’t good numbers — but that doesn’t mean they upended the larger outlook for solid economic growth and moderate inflation.” In a note titled “The Fed’s quandary as inflation warmer while labor cooler,” Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial says the latest economic numbers were not the combination the Fed wants to see. “If inflation data continues to indicate that prices are generally rising amid a backdrop of a cooler labor market, the Fed’s next meeting will undoubtedly involve a more heated discussion of which of the Fed’s mandates takes precedence,” she noted. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%. Most major groups retreated, though energy shares joined oil higher as the market awaited Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack. Megacaps were mixed, with Nvidia Corp. up and Apple Inc. down. Tesla Inc. edged lower ahead of the launch of the company’s fully self-driving vehicle.                                                             "

But the rise in stocks puts major indexes at lofty valuations, leaving long-term investors wondering how they should proceed from here. Bankrate’s Third-Quarter Market Mavens Survey asked market professionals what, if anything, long-term investors should do with their portfolios as stocks trade near all-time highs. Here’s what they had to say.

The investment pros surveyed by Bankrate think now is a good time to review those allocations. “If investors only do one thing, they should rebalance portfolios back to their targeted allocations,” says Chris Fasciano, senior portfolio manager at Commonwealth Financial Network. Wells Fargo Investment Institute Senior Global Market Strategist Sameer Samana also says now is a good time to review your overall portfolio. “Update your financial plan, and rebalance in-line with the plan’s recommended allocations,” he says. Portfolio rebalancing and diversification go hand in hand. A key reason for portfolio rebalancing is to make sure your portfolio stays diversified and doesn’t have too much or too little exposure to any one asset class. “For long-term investors, holding well-diversified portfolios, or broad market indices, is generally a winning strategy,” says Dec Mullarkey, managing director at SLC Management. “While markets can seem over valued at different points, some companies will deliver the expected strong growth while others fail but leave market share for new competitors,” Mullarkey says. “So, sticking with well-diversified portfolios and periodically rebalancing to your long-term asset mix targets, tends to be a reliable formula to capture stable long-term performance.” With stocks at highs, some of the experts surveyed expressed a more cautious tone and suggested investors pay close attention to any holdings that may be particularly risky.

Despite macroeconomic pressures impacting the retail pharmacy sector, the analyst writes that CVS has shown resilience thanks to its diversified business model. Also Read: CVS, UnitedHealth Request FTC Chair Recusal Amid Ongoing Pharmacy Benefit Managers Lawsuit. This has allowed the company to mitigate some of these challenges and capitalize on market share gains from less financially stable competitors. For 2025, Barclays estimates market forecasts include expectations of 110 basis points in Medicare margin expansion, which is on the lower end of CVS’s target range of 100-200 bps. Barclays has upgraded CVS from Equal Weight to Overweight, with a price target of $82, up from $63. By 2026, projections show about 90 bps of margin improvement. Collectively, this suggests a cumulative recovery of 200 bps over two years, placing consensus Medicare margins at approximately -2.0%, which may underestimate the speed of CVS’s recovery. CVS is well-positioned to continue gaining market share in the retail pharmacy space, a trend that Barclays estimates could accelerate in 2025 as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) moves forward with plans to close over 1,000 of the roughly 2,000 unprofitable stores identified for closure. While the full impact of Walgreens’ store closures will depend on the timing—spread over the next three years—the analyst expects a significant number to close within the first year due to their unprofitability. CVS has consistently increased its pharmacy market share since the first quarter of 2020, holding 27.2% as of the first quarter of 2024. Barclays estimates CVS has been gaining approximately 5-10 bps of market share each quarter, with cumulative gains likely exceeding 150 bps since before the pandemic.

The expansion to new markets is part of the company’s plan to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms said that it aims to make its AI chatbot more accessible by supporting multiple languages and attracting a global user base. With nearly 500 million monthly active users, Meta AI will begin its rollout in Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, Paraguay, the Philippines, and the UK, with added support for Tagalog. Subsequently, the expansion will continue into countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Thailand, Tunisia, the UAE, Vietnam, and Yemen, incorporating languages like Arabic, Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese. Following the phased introduction, Meta AI is expected to be available in 43 countries and support a dozen languages. However, the latest expansion will not include the new character voices for the AI chatbot that company CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed at the company's annual Connect conference. These features are set to be released on a different schedule, according to the company. Additionally, Meta AI will soon be accessible on Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the UK and Australia, further extending the platform's reach and capabilities. The latest development comes after Meta Platforms introduced Movie Gen, an AI video generator capable of creating or editing videos from simple text prompts. This tool, which can generate videos up to 16 seconds long, is said to position Meta in direct competition with OpenAI and Google, as the race to develop advanced AI technologies intensifies. \"Meta AI chatbot expands to 21 additional markets\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.

The ads, which include TV, online and print, focus on domestic travelers, Airbnb Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson told Skift. (See two of the ads below.) “Historically, Airbnb has been much more about travelers from abroad coming into Japan, or Japanese travelers, maybe traveling abroad to the U.S. or France, or other places,” Stephenson said. “This is about Japanese travelers, traveling in Japan, which is the significant majority of the travel market in Japan.” Stephenson said Airbnb’s growth in Japan would take “many years.” “It takes time, it takes persistence,” he added. Airbnb sees international expansion as an important opportunity. In addition to Japan, Airbnb is targeting Mexico, China, and Brazil, among other markets. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky spoke about the challenges of breaking into some global markets on the company’s second-quarter earnings call. “So like in Korea and Japan, they prefer to do browsing than search. So we’ve had to retool our product. And that’s yielded some huge conversion rate increases.” And he noted the opportunity in Japan, in particular: “Japan is going to be a longer game, but that’s one of the biggest travel markets in the world.” Here are the two Japan ads, which deal with the variety of accommodation options, including seaside properties, available on Airbnb, and their suitability for families: Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.

Berkshire sold 9.5 million shares over three days at an average price of around $40. Buffett began shedding Bank of America stock in mid-July.  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) won't have to report its transactions in Bank of America (BAC) stock promptly anymore. That's because Buffett continued his recent selloff of Berkshire's holdings in the bank, and no longer has a 10% stake, the level required to give timely updates on investments. In a securities filing, Berkshire said it had sold about 9.5 million shares of BofA over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at an average price of approximately $40, netting some $380 million. Following the sale, Berkshire owns 775 million BofA shares. Berkshire began dumping the bank's stock in mid-July, and last month shed another 5.8 million shares. Asked about that then, BofA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Moynihan called Buffett \"a great shareholder,\" and explained that he didn't know why Buffett was selling, but wasn't worried. \"Life will go on,\" he added. The news didn't hurt Bank of America shares, which rose 5% Friday morning along with other bank stocks, and are up about 25% year-to-date. TradingView Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "WeightWatchers (WW) is trying to save its ailing business by betting on a market that threatens its very existence. The weight-loss company, previously championed by the likes of Oprah Winfrey, saw its stock spike this week after announcing that it will make copycats of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs. WW International (i.e. WeightWatchers) stock jumped nearly 40% Wednesday following the news, and the stock climbed an additional 23% Thursday to close at $1.96. WW is up 172% from last week. Though WeightWatchers’ core business is its dieting program, the company has attempted to get in on the booming weight-loss drug market dominated by pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). (The strategy was championed by its former CEO Sima Sistani, who recently departed the company.) WeightWatchers first attempted to secure a foothold in the weighty drug space early last year with its acquisition of Sequence, a telehealth platform specializing in weight-loss medication management. The acquisition has failed to improve the company’s revenue, which fell 14.5% in 2023 and is expected to decline another 13% this year. WeightWatchers’ announcement Tuesday that it will offer compounded GLP-1 drugs — which are cheaper and don't require insurance — is another shot at capitalizing on the market late in the game. Federal laws allow companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration’s shortage list. Regulations allow the drugs to be made at FDA-registered facilities, but the compounded medications themselves are not FDA-approved. WeightWatchers will offer a compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Here's the rub: Once the Novo Nordisk drugs are removed from the FDA’s shortage list, WeightWatchers will no longer be able to produce compounded semaglutide drugs at scale. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound, was removed from the list last week, posing a massive problem for companies making compounded versions of the drug. “Compounding is not a sustainable long-term business model,” Barclays (BARC.L) healthcare technology and distribution analyst Stephanie Davis told Yahoo Finance. Davis is one of four Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg. Half of those analysts have Equal Weight ratings on WW, and Davis is one of the other two analysts who recommend selling the stock. Meanwhile, WeightWatchers’ expansion in the weight-loss drug space contradicts its core business. “GLP-1s are going to cannibalize the diet industry,” Davis said.            ",

        "body": "By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Thursday as investors looked to higher-than-expected inflation and unemployment claims for indications on the health of the U.S. economy and the path for interest rates. The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% on a monthly basis in September and 2.4% on an annual basis, with both figures being slightly higher than estimated by economists polled by Reuters. The core figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.3% year-over-year, versus an estimate of 3.2%. In a separate report released on Thursday, jobless claims also rose to 258,000 for the week ending Oct. 5, versus an estimate of 230,000. \"Investors were torn between a stronger than expected CPI report and a weaker than expected unemployment claims report,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital in Chicago. \"One showed inflation running hotter than expected and the other showed the economy looking weaker than expected. It's the worst of both worlds.\" After the economic data, traders were pricing in a roughly 80% probability that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in November and a roughly 20% chance it would leave rates unchanged, according to CME's FedWatch. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic on Thursday said he would be \"totally comfortable\" skipping an interest-rate cut at an upcoming meeting of the U.S. central bank, adding that the \"choppiness\" in recent data on inflation and employment may warrant leaving rates on hold in November. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he sees \"gradual\" rate cuts over the next year-and-a-half, while the New York Fed's John Williams said he still sees rate reductions ahead. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 57.88 points, or 0.14%, to 42,454.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.99 points, or 0.21%, to 5,780.05 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 9.57 points, or 0.05%, to 18,282.05. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow had notched record closing highs in the previous day's session. Only three of the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors advanced on Thursday with energy, adding 0.8% and outperforming the rest as oil prices rose. [O/R] Oil futures rallied as U.S. fuel use spiked ahead of Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on Florida's west coast late on Wednesday. Oil prices are also being supported by supply concerns related to conflicts in the Middle East. Investors are also preparing for the third-quarter earnings season, with major banks scheduled to report results on Friday.        ",

        "body": "Despite once being declared “worthless,” the market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is showing early signs of recovery. Last week saw the highest weekly sales for digital collectibles since August, according to new data from NFT market tracker CryptoSlam. The organization said that weekly sales rose to $82.6 million in the past seven days, a major jump for NFT sales volumes. However, the data has limitations. Weekly reports on NFTs offer only a short timeframe of information and do not take into account seasonal factors that may influence sales. Given the high volatility in NFT markets, these reports are unlikely to reflect the long-term health of the market as a whole. Despite this, however, NFTs continue to draw eye-watering sums. Earlier this month, a user sold a CryptoPunk NFT for $56.3 million. Earlier this year, CryptoSlam reported a major plunge in NFT sales volumes, reporting a 45% decrease in NFT sales during the second quarter of the year. More recent data shows that August recorded the year's lowest NFT sales volumes, coming in at just $376.3 million, making the summer month the worst month of the year for sales. While the current upsurge in NFT sales pales in comparison to the volume recorded during the crypto market’s 2021-2022 bull run, some are speculating that NFTs are due for a resurgence. More than $26.5 million in NFT sales were recorded on the Ethereum blockchain network recently, and this week alone has seen over $5.5 million in sales, a figure that might only grow. "

The idea presumably is to provide ballast for her funds, which consist mostly of riskier stocks. Sometimes she’ll even buy when the stocks are rising, and that’s what she did Tuesday. Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter Investors and analysts are split in their views of Wood, possibly the country’s best-known investor after Warren Buffett. Boosters view her as a technology genius, while critics contend she’s just a mediocre money manager. Wood (Mama Cathie to her acolytes) soared to fame after a whopping return of 153% in 2020 and clear explanations of her investment strategy in frequent media appearances. Marco Bello/Getty Images But her longer-term performance won’t make you forget Buffett. Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $5.5 billion in assets, produced annualized returns of 15% for the past 12 months, negative 25% for the past three years and positive 3% for five years. That pales in comparison to the S&P 500. The index posted positive annualized returns of 35% for one year, 11% for three years, and 16% for five years. Wood’s investment philosophy is simple. Ark ETFs usually purchase emerging-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. Wood says companies in those categories are game changers. Of course, these stocks are often volatile, so Ark funds’ values can oscillate sharply. Renowned investment research firm Morningstar has launched strong criticism of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. Related: Cathie Wood sells two rocking tech stocks The potential of Wood’s five high-tech platforms listed above is “compelling,” Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote in a commentary. “But the firm’s ability to spot winners and manage their myriad risks is less so. ... It has not proved it is worth the risks it takes.” Morningstar portfolio strategist Amy Arnott calculated that Ark Innovation destroyed $7.1 billion of shareholder wealth from its 2014 inception through 2023. That put the ETF No. 3 on her wealth destruction list for mutual funds and ETFs over the past decade. Fraser Perring, a short-seller who founded Viceroy Research, unleashed a harsh assessment of Wood in 2022. “I wouldn’t even put your money with Cathie Wood,” he told New York magazine. “She is part of the problem. ... She’s a capital depleter. With the amount of capital she’s evaporated, how can people even suggest she’s successful? She’s successful at failing.”                  ",

Japan: Nikkei posts small rise as producer prices rise more than expected The Nikkei 225 hovered near breakeven, posting a minimal 0.26% rise with the financial sector leading the way, as traders awaited the release of U.S. before the bell in New York.

But some important industries are still feeling the aftershocks of the pandemic – despite undoubted recoveries. The cruise industry is one of these. While the overall hospitality and leisure sector is definitely enjoying better times, the world’s major cruise companies are showing idiosyncratic reactions as the vacation market normalizes – although it remains to be seen how the industry will absorb the shock of the recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the cruise lines are showing recent gains in earnings and revenues, and some are also showing powerful stock gains, while some are dealing with debt fallout from the pandemic. Assessing the current state of the industry, Citi analyst James Hardiman thinks the sector presents solid opportunities. “Our web traffic analysis points to September cruise traffic being among the best on record,” Hardiman recently noted. “Whereas Street narratives/multiplies see strong recent performance as a ‘catch-up trade’, our analysis and data suggest this growth has real legs into ‘25 and beyond.” Looking toward that long-term horizon, we’ve used the TipRanks Smart Score tool to locate two top-scoring cruise stocks – stocks that Hardiman feels deserve some closer investor attention. The Smart Score gathers and collates the voluminous market data on every stock, and uses it to rate the share in comparison to a set of factors that are known to predict outperformance. Both of these cruise stocks – Hardiman’s picks for the coming year – have also earned the Smart Score’s ‘Perfect 10’ rating. Let’s give them a closer look and find out exactly why the analyst and the AI algorithm agree that these are compelling buys. Carnival Corporation (CCL) First up, Carnival Cruise Corporation, a giant of the modern cruise industry with a 50-plus year history in the business. The company boasts a market cap of more than $25.5 billion, making it the second-largest cruise company plying the seas today. Carnival operates through its various brands, which include such famous cruise-industry names as Princess, Holland-America, and Cunard. Through these brands, Carnival Corporation sails a fleet of 95 modern cruise ships. Carnival’s brands are well-known, and respected for their modern equipment. The company is also known for its distinctive liveries – Carnival’s eponymous brand sails ships with funnels painted in a red-and-blue scheme, and shaped like a whale’s tale fluke, while Cunard, operating the famous liners Queen Mary 2 and Queen Elizabeth, is known for its black hulls and white superstructures. Passengers boarding a Carnival Corporation ship know what they are stepping aboard.                 ",

        "body": "Tempest Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:TPST) stock is trading higher on Thursday, with a strong session volume of over 23 million as per data from Benzinga Pro. The company entered into an agreement with Roche Holdings AG (OTC:RHHBY) to advance the evaluation of amezalpat (TPST-1120) in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and bevacizumab, the current standard of care for unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), into a Phase 3 trial for the first-line treatment of liver cancer. Under the agreement, Roche will supply atezolizumab globally and Tempest will sponsor and lead the pivotal study. This agreement builds on a clinical collaboration between the companies under which amezalpat was combined with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line HCC patients and compared to atezolizumab and bevacizumab alone in a randomized Phase 1b/2 study. Tempest retains all development and commercial rights to amezalpat. “Based on the positive Phase 2 data, I believe this combination therapy holds the potential to significantly improve first-line liver cancer treatment, and we look forward to amezalpat moving into this pivotal Phase 3 study,” said Stephen Brady, president and CEO of Tempest. In June, Tempest reported updated survival data from the ongoing global randomized Phase 1b/2 study, demonstrating a six-month improvement in median overall survival (OS) for patients receiving the combination therapy compared to the control arm of atezolizumab and bevacizumab alone. The survival benefit observed in the amezalpat arm was also maintained in key subpopulations. These June data build upon previously released data from the primary analysis showing that the amezalpat combination therapy provided clinical benefit regardless of PD-L1 status and in patients with both immune excluded and immune desert tumors. Patients with a mutation in the beta-catenin gene had an increased objective response rate, and a longer median OS was observed in the updated data set. Both were supported by amezalpat’s purported mechanism of action. The company is preparing for the Phase 3 study to start in the first quarter of 2025.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation The National Transmission Company South Africa, a state-owned business that will operate separately from parent Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., said this week it plans to spend 112 billion rand ($6.4 billion) on transmission capacity over the next five years. The NTCSA — which started up on Monday — said it’s considering building infrastructure itself or paying for developers to construct transmission lines and then taking them over, as well as “independent transmission projects” that may involve issuing concessions to private companies. While it hasn’t decided on funding models, at least some of the money would have to come from capital markets, according to Rand Merchant Bank. “Transmission infrastructure is capital-intensive and requires long-term funding,” Kate Rushton, a credit analyst at RMB, wrote in a report. “The debt market, including traditional providers such as banks, and the bond market will be important sources of debt financing.” A flood of new issuance for transmission lines and other infrastructure spending by state-owned companies may help revive the corporate bond market, where new issuance remains below the record levels seen before Covid-19 plunged the economy into contraction. Bond sales by companies reached 169 billion rand in 2019, before slumping in 2020. Issuance this year is at 116 billion rand, according to data compiled by Rand Merchant Bank, which expects borrowing to reach 131 billion rand by year-end. State-owned companies contributed just 15 billion rand. “There’s definitely scope for capital-raising in that market,” said Valdene Reddy, director of capital markets at JSE Ltd., which operates the country’s stock and bond markets. “The transmission company will be a good exercise, but there’s still a big piece of work in terms of restructuring that balance sheet. Getting that pipeline ready, even if it’s not a short-term initiative, but a medium-term initiative for listing equity or debt, will be quite healthy.” In an Oct. 9 review, Moody’s Ratings said Eskom would have to raise debt to finance network investments, but its ability to access markets on commercial terms — without new government guarantees — would depend on “significant improvement in its operations, debt collection, governance and regulatory arrangements.”                 "

        "body": "BofA Securities has upgraded Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), an energy infrastructure company that owns and controls oil and gas pipelines and terminals. The analyst notes stabilized base business. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter 2024 earnings on 16 October, with analysts estimating $0.27 for adjusted EPS and $3.95 billion for revenues. Amid uncertainty in the energy sector, the analyst recognizes the potential in companies with contracted natural gas pipelines. With increasing demand driven by Gulf Coast LNG projects and the electrification of utilities through AI, Kinder Morgan is positioned for long-term growth through its contracted business model. The strength of its natural gas pipeline business, which commands a higher valuation, balances out the declines seen in lower-valued CO and product pipelines. The analyst has upgraded from Neutral to Buy rating with a price target of $27, up from $23. Kinder Morgan has demonstrated its ability to supply gas to utilities, similar to Williams Companies Inc (NYSE:WMB), exemplified by the recent sanctioning of a $3 billion, 1.2 Bcf/d SNG pipeline expansion last quarter. Also Read: Hurricane Milton Evacuations ‘A Matter Of Life And Death,’ Biden Says: Fed’s Bostic Says Storm Could Have Significant Economic Impact Over Next 6 Months. BofA writes that the core business is now robust. Concerns that previously caused hesitation have been resolved, including the Supreme Court halted the Good Neighbor plan, which could have cost Kinder Morgan billions, the Double H pipeline, which represents the only significant contract roll of approximately $30 million in 2024, is transitioning to NGL service, effectively compensating for the prior contract, and recent acreage exchanges are revitalizing oil declines. Kinder Morgan currently accounts for 45% of LNG deliveries, and the analyst anticipates it will retain this market share. More importantly, the rise in power demand driven by electrification and AI is expected to contribute an additional conservative estimate of 4-5 Bcf/d of gas demand by 2030, particularly in regions served by Kinder Morgan pipelines.

This follows five consecutive months of decline, reflecting weak economic growth as domestic consumption continued to be held back by the ongoing property crisis in the country. Overall GDP growth slowed to 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024 from 5.3% in the first quarter. Retail sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), comprising electric mainly plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, jumped by 51% year-on-year to 1.12 million units in September, driven by stimulus measures introduced this year by the Chinese government. At the end of July the government doubled the one-off subsidy it introduced in April to CNY20,000 (US$2,800) for buyers trading in their old internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for qualifying new battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The government had previously also taken measures to push the struggling banking sector to reduce downpayment requirements on vehicle loans. In the first eight months of 2024 domestic retail sales of passenger vehicles increased by 2% to 15.5 million units, with NEV sales rising by 37% to 7.13 million units. \"China car market ticks up in September\" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "body": "A big jump in retail spending would be the next data point indicating a \"no landing\" of the economy. BofA analysts expect retail sales last month to soar 0.8%, above forecasts of 0.2%. A no-landing scenario occurs when strong economic growth fuels inflation and hinders rate cuts. America's spending habits are the next data point to monitor as Wall Street investors see rising odds of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy. Bank of America analysts expect September retail sales data, set for release on October 17, to show a 0.8% surge. Consensus estimates expect just 0.2% growth, according to economists polled by Bloomberg. The analysts say such a large jump in retail spending would likely increase the odds of a no-landing. That's a situation in which continued economic growth adds fuel to inflation and prevents the Federal Reserve from quickly cutting interest rates. While such an outcome points to a strong economy, it also could be bad news for people waiting for relief from higher borrowing costs. The analysts say that while monthly retail data can fluctuate, a big increase last month would be cause for concern. \"Monthly retail sales data can be volatile. But a report like the one we are forecasting would be significant,\" the analysts said in a Thursday note. They suggest that a strong report on the heels of \"very encouraging\" GDP and GDI revisions and a \"gangbusters\" September jobs report would only extend the slew of recent upside surprises that point to a hot economy. \"A month ago, the question was whether we are headed for a recession or a soft landing. If retail sales accelerate considerably, in our view, the narrative may shift further toward 'no landing' or even re-acceleration,\" they said. If the Fed has to pause its easing cycle amid high inflation, Americans will be left with higher prices and steeper borrowing costs. The analysts' outlook comes after last week's blockbuster September jobs report ignited speculation of a no-landing scenario. The report showed that the economy added 254,000 jobs in September, far above analyst estimates. Economic and income growth has also proved strong, with a set of revisions last month showing GDP grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter. The consumer price index, meanwhile, came in slightly higher than estimates on Thursday. The analysts acknowledge that last month's retail data might not be enough to force the Fed to stop its easing cycle, \"at least, not yet.\" They say the Fed will likely cut two to four more times even if the labor and economic activity remain strong.

A day after a California judge ruled the company has to open Android to third-party app stores, the Justice Department, in another case, said it may propose that the tech giant sell off a part of its business, like the Chrome browser or Android, to break up its search dominance. And how did Wall Street react to a potentially seismic event that could forever reshape the tech landscape? With a shrug — Google shares sank less than 2% Wednesday after the DOJ’s breakup recommendation. Part of the muted reaction has to do with the sluggish pace of legal proceedings. Even if judges rule against Google in every subsequent decision, the ultimate adverse outcome is still years away. But Wall Street also wagers that such a drastic decision would be so difficult to implement and so destructive in its consequences that a more modest remedy is likelier. Like separating conjoined twins, cutting off Google’s intertwined businesses poses immense challenges, and it almost seems hard to believe. And many still don't. “The street is looking at this and thinking despite all the scary headlines and noise that the chances of a breakup are minimal,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Investors are largely looking past Google’s legal troubles, cleaving instead to Mountain View’s vision for growth, powered by its cloud business, AI initiatives, and advertising empire. In a 32-page proposal, lawyers for the Justice Department outlined a framework of options for how the court should dismantle Google’s monopoly power in search. The potential remedies spanned from the harshest — breaking the company apart — to more limited plans, such as forcing Google into a data-sharing arrangement with rival search providers. But even as the most severe remedy is on the table, investors are still waiting for more guidance before making any big moves. In that reading, what may initially seem like denial reads pragmatic. “We think Google’s valuation at the moment largely discounts most of the associated regulatory risks but the market is looking for greater clarity on pending issues before bidding the stock in one direction over another,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Google’s year-to-date stock performance has lagged behind most of its Magnificent Seven peers, sitting in fifth place up about 15% and trailing the broader market’s gains of about 21%. So it may be that Wall Street has already priced in the regulatory risks. What’s more, an outcome that mandates Google change its business practices, rather than divest, could push the stock higher if investors see the ruling as a merciful punishment.         ",

This was the largest single-day jump of the past two years. What are the takeaways for transportation providers and managers in the wake of the third major transportation market disruption to hit in less than a month? Hurricanes can be the catalysts for dramatic shifts in North American transportation markets, traditionally making sourcing truckload capacity much more challenging. Shipping activity stalls for days, infrastructure like roads and warehouses are damaged, and then comes the disaster relief draw for carriers. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was the primary catalyst for one of the longest stretches of trucking market tightening of the past 20 years outside of COVID. In the days leading into a hurricane, carriers avoid driving into danger — as they should. Shippers may send out increased orders as they try to move their goods out of harm’s way. Inbound tender rejection rates for the Lakeland market in central Florida spiked to over 15%, the highest value since the pandemic era ended in early 2022. Outbound tender volumes also increased ahead of the storm, before dropping quickly as it made landfall. This type of activity creates bottlenecks in transportation shipping for a period of time after the storm passes. The national freight market has been a well-oiled machine since early 2022, as there has been more than enough trucking capacity to fill in the gaps when disruptions have occurred. Milton is the third major disruption to hit national transportation networks over the past three weeks. Hurricane Helene landed in the Big Bend area of the Florida Gulf Coast on Sept. 26 as a major Category 4 storm. The bulk of the damage occurred inland as the system quickly tracked into north Georgia and the western Carolinas. The storm caused catastrophic damage to the area but was not a major immediate disruption to transportation due to the lack of a major outbound shipping presence being impacted. The following week, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) went on strike for three days, resulting in several days of lost container clearing and shipping activity around the East Coast ports. While many shippers were prepared for this, some slight deterioration was detected in the form of slightly increasing rejection and spot rates.                "

Other data from the Labor Department on Thursday showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged last week to the highest level in more than a year, driven by Hurricane Helene and a nearly month-old strike at Boeing. The strike and hurricanes could cloud the labor market picture through the end of the year.

Morgan Wealth Management. \"Either way, inflation has been normalizing. As such, the evolution of the Fed's approach feels prudent.\" The consumer price index increased 0.2% last month after gaining 0.2% in August, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Food prices jumped 0.4% after rising 0.1% in August. Grocery store food prices increased 0.4%, lifted by higher costs for meat, poultry, fish and eggs. Fruits and vegetable prices rebounded 0.9% after dropping 0.2% in August. But consumers got some relief from gasoline prices, which plunged 4.1%. Rents increased 0.3% after climbing 0.4% in the prior month. In the 12 months through September, the CPI rose 2.4%. That was the smallest year-on-year increase since February 2021 and followed a 2.5% advance in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1% and rising 2.3% year-on-year. The annual increase in inflation has slowed from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Inflation is a major issue for voters in next month's presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's nominee, is locked in a tight race with the Republican Party's candidate Donald Trump. The Fed has mostly shifted focus to the labor market, delivering an unusually large 50 basis points rate cut in September. Minutes of that meeting published on Wednesday showed a \"substantial majority\" of policymakers supported starting an era of easier monetary policy with an outsized cut, but there appeared even broader agreement that the initial move would not commit the Fed to any particular pace of rate reductions in the future.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? New rules speeding up baseball make it more fun for fans, and women’s basketball is seeing a surge in viewers thanks to Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, he said Thursday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference. Boxing, Smith said, is one he would sell. “The promoters have ruined the sport,” Smith said. “They need somebody like (UFC chief) Dana White overseeing the sport. So you can give us the fights we want to see, when we want to see them, as opposed to dudes being able to avoid one another because they might get knocked out.” Golf is a sell, too, despite Tiger Woods’ success in what was historically an all-White sport. “There is nothing about golf that says to me, I’m invited, nothing,” said Smith, who is Black. “It costs a boatload of money to be a member of the club. You got to buy your golf clubs. It’s at a country club that, you know, the only time you really, really see Black folks, they’re working there.” Smith, 56, is one of the best known personalities on ESPN, serving as the featured commentator and executive producer of the weekday morning show First Take and as an analyst on NBA Countdown. He also hosts his own show on ESPN’s radio network. The network, which is owned by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., is suffering like other traditional TV companies as consumers cancel cable-TV subscriptions and shift to streaming services. As a result, ESPN has been in cost-cutting mode in recent years, with several high-profile personalities departing. Last month, one of the network’s highest-paid stars, NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, announced he was retiring. Smith has reportedly been looking for as much as $25 million annually in a new contract, twice what he’s currently making. He said he prefers to stay as ESPN and wants to reach a deal with the network. “And so now a negotiation takes place and hopefully the two sides can come to an accord,” he said. “And if we can’t, we can’t.

        "body": " Shares of Uber and Lyft jumped on Friday after Tesla's introduction to its new robotaxi failed to live up to ridesharing investors' fears. Analysts noted Tesla's much-anticipated event was light on details about the rollout of a ridesharing app that would compete with Uber or Lyft, lifting an uncertainty that has hung over the stocks for months. Uber shares hit an all-time high, while Tesla slumped further into negative territory for the year.  Shares of Uber Technologies (UBER) jumped to a record high on Friday after Tesla’s (TSLA) much-anticipated robotaxi launch event failed to live up to ridesharing investors' fears. Tesla on Thursday evening unveiled its CyberCab, an autonomous car designed for ridesharing, and a 20-seater \"RoboVan.\" CEO Elon Musk said the CyberCab would cost less than $30,000, and described a vision of individuals operating fleets of CyberCabs as an alternative to driving one car through either Uber or Lyft. Analysts were disappointed by the event, noting it was lighter on details than many Uber and Lyft investors had feared. Jefferies analysts in a note to clients called the CyberCab “toothless,” and said the event was a “best-case outcome for Uber.” Tesla, the analysts wrote, didn't \"provide verifiable evidence of progress\" on autonomous vehicles (AV), and that Uber was “uniquely positioned to support sustainable growth for AV developers.” Jefferies has a “buy” rating on Uber stock. Bank of America analysts noted that some risks remain, including the potential for RoboVans and CyberCabs to cost significantly less to operate than a conventional rideshare. However, Tesla gave “no specific business model” for a rideshare app that would compete with Uber or Lyft. They maintained their \"buy\" rating on Uber. Uber stock was up nearly 10% at $85.66, an all-time high, on Friday afternoon. Shares of competitor Lyft (LYFT) also jumped almost 10%. Tesla shares slumped, putting them down 12% since the start of the year. Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "US stocks were lower on Thursday after the latest consumer inflation print came in hotter than anticipated, further blurring the picture of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision in November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped around 0.1%, or just less than 60 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2% after both clinched fresh record highs on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was off less than 0.1%. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 1% as it eyed a rise to a record high, while e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) also rose roughly 1%, helping the Nasdaq pare earlier losses. In focus on Thursday was a reading on consumer inflation showing prices rose 0.2% last month, more than the 0.1% rise Wall Street was expecting. On an annualized basis, prices rose 2.4%, compared with 2.3% expected. The data was of greater interest than usual as investors puzzle over the chances of a \"no landing\" for the economy after last week's jobs report revived worries about inflation flaring up again. But the jobs market provided a surprise of its own on Thursday, as initial unemployment claims rose to 258,000, much more than Wall Street anticipated and the highest print since August 2023. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Amid all the moving parts, traders now see a 17% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Just a week ago, the odds of no cut were at 0% as the market heeded policymakers' message and prepared for a 25 basis point rate reduction. Also on deck is Tesla's (TSLA) highly anticipated robotaxi event on Thursday evening. CEO Elon Musk is expected to reveal a two-door, butterfly-wing prototype of the cybercab he has bet the EV maker's future on. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) added as much as 4 basis points on Thursday to hit 4.1% for the first time since late July. The 10-year has now added roughly 30 basis points over the past week as investors have scaled back their expectations for interest rate cuts amid signs that inflation may be stickier than initially thought while economic growth data holds steady. For much of the past few years, higher yields have been a headwind for stocks. But Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance on Thursday yields likely have risen enough to be too much of a headwind just yet. \"I don't think this backup in interest rates is all that worrisome for equities in aggregate,\" Kantrowitz said. \"But where it does show up is in leadership.\" Kantrowitz pointed out that areas like Real Estate (XLRE) and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT), which had benefited from investors anticipating lower rates, have lagged amid the 10-year yields recent rise. For now, Kantrowitz added, rising rates are driving market leadership more than it is weighing on the overall S&P 500 index. \"If rates keep going higher, I don't think it's a massive issue for equities unless it persists for, I'd say, a few months,\" he said. Weekly jobless claims soared to 258,000 in the week ending Oct. 5, the largest weekly gain since August 2023. The move higher from the prior week's reading of 225,000 was the largest week-over-week increase since July 2021. Economists were quick to point out that the ongoing strike from Boeing workers and the several hurricanes that hit different parts of the US over the past several weeks likely impacted the results. \"Claims rose markedly in some of the states most impacted by Hurricane Helene and the Boeing strike although some unimpacted states saw large increases as well,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"Claims will likely continue to be elevated in states affected by Helene, Hurricane Milton and the Boeing strike until its resolved.\" Even with some clear distortion from Hurricane Helene, Citi economist Gisela Hoxha wrote in a note to clients that states that weren't impacted by the hurricane also saw an increase. \"This suggests that the rise in initial claims is not just a temporary weather driven increase but could reflect some genuine economic weakness in other parts of the country,\" Hoxha wrote. On the surface, this would likely boost the case for a November interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which has made it clear it won't welcome further signs of labor market weakness. But Thursday also brought a hotter-than-expected inflation reading, which furthered the case for the Fed not to cut at all in November. Combine both pieces of data and the picture is rather mixed. There is perhaps one clear takeaway, though: Higher claims are likely going to be the norm heading into the Fed's next meeting. This means market participants will continue to debate whether the central bank will be willing to write off the increase as noise from weather-related job displacements or consider it a true sign of labor market deterioration. Tesla stock (TSLA) was nearly flat on Thursday as investors anxiously await the electric vehicle maker's “We, Robot” event, set to take place well after the closing bell on Wall Street. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: While most don’t expect a fully functional robotaxi that can be deployed right away, it’s what CEO Elon Musk and Tesla can do to paint a picture of autonomous self-driving that the company envisions for the next five or 10 years down the road that matters. Possible leaks have already surfaced suggesting Tesla may strike a robo-delivery deal with DoorDash, for instance. (Yahoo Finance could not verify those reports.) Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who named Tesla his “top pick” in the autos space, has nonetheless advised clients to “keep expectations well managed” for the event. What will most likely be on display is a demonstration of the latest iteration of FSD (full self-driving) software and a demonstration of a fully autonomous \"cybercab\" in a closed or semi-closed course, Jonas wrote last month. But in a more recent note last week, Jonas said investors may hear more about how those cybercabs, or robotaxis, will be deployed. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Columnist Kerry Hannon writes: The increase in Social Security benefits next year will be pocket-sized. The Social Security administration announced a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2025. That’s down from 3.2% this year but in line with the 2.6% average over the past two decades. Starting in January, the increase will add a little under $50 to the average monthly benefit of roughly $1,900, according to the SSA, providing some comfort to the more than 72 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who have grappled with higher prices in recent years. Read more here. Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic told the Wall Street Journal in an interview he'd be \"comfortable with skipping a meeting if the data suggests that’s appropriate.\" Additionally, Bostic told the Journal's Nick Timiraos that he only penciled in one additional interest rate cut for 2024 in his most recent submission to the Summary of Economic Projections. “So that already signals that I’m open to not moving at one of the last two meetings if the data comes in as I expect,” Bostic said. Bostic's commentary comes after a hotter-than-expected September jobs report and a reading on inflation for September, which showed price increases not cooling as fast as hoped, have fueled investor bets that the Fed may not reduce interest rates further at its November meeting. Traders now see a 15% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Just a week ago, the odds of no cut were at 0%. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose sharply last week, a new challenge for beleaguered house hunters and potential refinancing candidates. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan jumped to 6.32% for the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac, up from 6.12% a week earlier. It’s the biggest week-over-week increase since April. Read more here. WW International (WW), better known as WeightWatchers, surged more than 15% Thursday. The stock has gone on a furious rally this week following the company's announcement that it will offer a copycat of weight-loss drugs like those from Novo Nordisk (NVO). WeightWatchers shares were up 38% Wednesday, and the stock is up nearly 160% from last week but remains far from record highs around $100 in 2018. The company has struggled amid heightened competition in the weight loss space, an unsuccessful rebrand, and disruptions related to COVID-19. US laws permit companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the Food and Drug Administration's shortage list. The federal agency recently removed tirzepatide from the list, which is the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's (LLY) GLP-1 drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro. WeightWatchers will sell a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy. Oil gained as much as 2% on Thursday as traders assessed whether ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran will result in a supply disruption. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded above $74 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, jumped more than 2% to hover around $78 per barrel. \"Crude [is] continuing to find equilibrium value lifting prices today as uncertainty remains over when and where Israel will strike into Hezbollah and Iran,\" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading for BOK Financial Securities, said in a note on Thursday. Hurricane Milton's Florida landfall also kept the markets on edge. Production and refinery activity was not expected to be disrupted. However, analysts anticipated an interruption of distribution around the impacted areas as gas stations ran low on supplies. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: A warmer-than-expected inflation reading released Thursday offers new ammunition for Federal Reserve hawks who are arguing for a gradual pace of interest rate cuts. This report, according to some Fed watchers, is unlikely to change the path outlined by policymakers for smaller future cuts following an initial 50 basis point reduction in September. Investors, in fact, boosted the odds that the Fed will trim its policy rate by 25 basis points in November to 87% following the CPI release. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports: September's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came in hotter than analysts expected, but the data offered one major point of optimism: Shelter cost increases came down during the month, flashing an encouraging economic signal that the most stubborn contributor to inflation may finally be giving ground. \"The sharp reversal in shelter inflation allays fears that it could reaccelerate after the jump in August and brings the trend back toward the gradual disinflation that we continue to expect,\" said Parker Ross, global chief economist at Arch Capital Group Read more here. Falling gasoline prices were not enough to offset higher food and shelter prices in September, contributing to a hotter-than-expected inflation print. The gasoline index decreased 4.1% last month, compared to a decline of 0.6% in the prior month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. On an annualized basis, gasoline prices dropped 15.3%, while the energy index as a whole decreased 6.8%. Read more here. The major averages opened lower on Thursday after the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in hotter than expected, setting the expectation that the Federal Reserve will opt for a smaller rate cut at its meeting next month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (^DJI) fell nearly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed roughly 0.3%. Both slipped from their fresh record-high closes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped 0.5%. Technology (XLK) stocks led the declines, followed by Consumer Discretionary (XLY). On the flip side, Energy (XLE) stocks rose as oil jumped Thursday morning. Investors may be anticipating the Federal Reserve's next interest rate cut will be 25 basis points rather than 50 after inflation rose by 0.2% in September, more than the 0.1% rise Wall Street was expecting, according to the latest government data. Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported third quarter earnings that missed Wall Street's expectations Thursday morning, Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith reports. The miss sent its stock down as much as 7% in premarket trading before paring losses. Here's a look at its performance compared to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Delta said it forecasts earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.85 for the fourth quarter, with its $1.73 midpoint slightly below the $1.78 Wall Street analysts had expected, according to Bloomberg data. Delta CEO Ed Bastian blamed disruptions caused by a widespread CrowdStrike outage in mid-July. Issues with CrowdStrike's cybersecurity software, used by Delta, forced the airline to cancel thousands of flights and wiped $380 million from its revenue for the quarter, he said. “We had 86 great days and we had five days that were impacted, caused by CrowdStrike,” Bastian told Yahoo Finance. Read the full story here. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected last week in the latest sign that, while the labor market has shown some strength, there is still cooling in the jobs market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 258,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Oct. 5, up from 225,000 the week prior and above the 230,000 economists had expected. This marked the highest weekly unemployment claims since August 2023. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.86 million, up by 42,000 from the week prior. A closely watched report on US inflation showed consumer prices rose more than expected in September, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.4% over the prior year in September, an acceleration compared to August's 2.5% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase was higher than the 2.3% economists had expected. The index rose 0.2% over the previous month, above Wall Street's expectation for a 0.1% increase. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in September climbed 0.3% over the prior month and 2.4% over last year. Core prices rose 0.3% month over month and 3.2% on an annual basis in August. Both the monthly and yearly core readings were hotter than economists had projected. ",

All three gauges finished the first full trading week of October with weekly wins of more than 1%.

Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards At the same time, investors weighed the likely impact of a hot inflation print this week and unchanged wholesale inflation on Federal Reserve policy. The latest consumer inflation data failed to clearly signal the Fed's next move on interest rate cuts. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose nearly 1% to notch a new record high on Friday, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% to close above 5,800 for the first time ever. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased about 0.3% after closing out Thursday with small losses. Financials (XLF) outperformed on Friday, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) jumping after third quarter results came in better than expected. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary (XLY) stocks ended the session slightly lower, weighed by shares of EV giant Tesla (TSLA) following the reveal of a highly anticipated driverless robotaxi. Next week, earnings season continues in full swing, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) expected to report. On the cusp of another earnings season, it seems like quarterly results are far from the forefront of investors' minds, writes Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman. After a hot jobs report and a consumer inflation reading that didn’t put to bed concerns about rising prices, there’s more confusion than usual about what the Federal Reserve will do next with rates. Hopes for China stimulus and its ripple effect have sprung up, but the picture there remains murky as well, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in Chinese stocks. Throw in a couple of literal hurricanes and a figurative one in the Mideast, and investors have a lot to weigh when making decisions. “I think this earnings season is going to be pretty tricky,” Ohsung Kwon, US and Canada equity strategist at Bank of America, said in a recent interview. \"Now that the easing cycle has started, what are companies going to say about any early indications of improvement given the lower rate environment?” Wherever the forecasts land, “As long as companies have managed through macro headwinds and see early signs of improvement from lower rates, stocks should get rewarded,” Kwon wrote. Read the full story on investor challenges for the weeks ahead here. Boeing stock (BA) bounced up 2% from its its 52-week low on Friday as the plane maker took a tougher stance with its biggest union after a breakdown in negotiations this week left little hope of a quick resolution to an ongoing labor strike. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré reports that the plane maker on Thursday filed an unfair labor practice charge against representatives of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), claiming \"bad-faith bargaining.\" The move comes days after bargaining talks involving mediators broke down and Boeing withdrew its contract proposal on Tuesday. The labor strike is proving costly on several fronts for Boeing. The work stoppage has interrupted the company's recovery efforts to ramp up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets to 38 per month by the end of the year, up from roughly 25 per month in June and July. Earlier this week S&P Global placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the work stoppage continues until the end of the year. Riskier credit makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to borrow money. Read the full story on the implications for the ongoing strike here. The start of earnings season gave stocks a jolt Friday afternoon as big US banks impressed and offered positive momentum after a hot inflation print and unchanged wholesale inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained close to 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.2% after closing out Thursday with small losses. All three major gauges were set to score wins for the week, with the Dow up 0.9%, the S&P set to gain close to 1%, and the Nasdaq on course for 1% gain. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: BlackRock (BLK): The investment company rose 3% during afternoon trading on Friday after reporting third quarter earnings that surpassed investor expectations, propelling its stock higher. The investment giant posted record assets under management (AUM) for the quarter, reaching $11.5 trillion. Tesla (TSLA): Shares of the electric vehicle maker sank more than 8% Friday morning after CEO Elon Musk revealed the long-awaited driverless robotaxi on Thursday night, which left investors wanting more. The Cybercab features no steering wheels or pedals, and is designed to be fully autonomous. AO Smith (AOS): The maker of water heaters sank more than 5% after the company cut its earnings outlook for the fiscal year, which also dropped below analyst expectations. AO Smith also lowered its net sales forecasts Trump Media (DJT): Shares of the former president's media and tech company rose nearly 8% Friday morning, following an announced release of its Truth+ streaming app for Android devices on Thursday. The gains build on momentum from earlier in the week — its longest rally since June — as investors also assess Trump's standing in the presidential election. Shares of the ride-hailing company Uber (UBER) and its chief rival, Lyft (LYFT), both rose more than 10% Friday afternoon, with Uber reaching record levels as investors appeared unimpressed with Tesla's robotaxi unveiling. Tesla has envisioned a fleet of driverless taxis that users could summon on their phones, which could pose new competition to the app-based transportation platforms. But analysts critical of the demonstration said Musk failed to deliver key details on the self-driving taxi rollout, giving the transportation companies a boost. Jefferies analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets\" with “little evidence of feasibility.” On the other hand, more bullish analysts see an optimistic future for Tesla's ambitious plans. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said in a note on Friday that Tesla could ramp to 100,000 Cybercabs by 2027, with production possibly beginning in 2026. Investors pushed the stocks of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) higher Friday after third quarter results looked better than feared, a demonstration of resilience from the banking giants that points to the possibility of a soft landing for the US economy, reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. One JPMorgan executive was even willing to connect the bank’s performance to that soft landing, citing strength on the part of the lender’s consumer and corporate customers. An economy that achieves a soft landing is one where inflation slows without causing a recession. \"Broadly, I would say these earnings are consistent with the soft-landing narrative,\" the bank's CFO, Jeremy Barnum, told reporters. And the fact that companies are optimistic, he added, is \"pretty consistent with this kind of Goldilocks economic situation.\" The results kicked off a third quarter earnings season as lenders face questions about how a new Federal Reserve rate-cutting cycle will affect the biggest US banks over the next year. Read more here. The initial reaction on Wall Street to Tesla's robotaxi unveiling was underwhelming, sending the stock about 8% lower. But to the company's supporters, the event delivered on Musk's vision of pushing the electric vehicle maker to be more than merely a car company. Dan Ives, a vocal supporter of Musk's autonomous future, agreed with the skeptics asking for more details about Tesla's ambitious autonomous vision. But in a note on Friday, he said, \"We strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment as we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.\" Optimus is Tesla's humanoid robot, several of which walked into the event space on their own during the demonstration. Musk said the robots would likely cost between $20,000 and $30,000 when they eventually go on sale years from now — a claim he has made in the past. \"Optimus is going to become a bigger piece of the Tesla story and now there is no credit for this ground breaking robotic future in Tesla's current valuation,\" said Ives. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday: Tesla (TSLA): Shares of the electric vehicle maker sank more than 8% Friday morning after CEO Elon Musk revealed the long-awaited driverless robotaxi on Thursday night, which left investors wanting more. The Cybercab features no steering wheels or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous. JPMorgan (JPM): The financial services company rose almost 5% after reporting third quarter earnings that revealed a surprise gain in net interest income and raised its full-year forecast. Uber (UBER): Shares of the ride-hailing company and its chief rival, Lyft (LYFT), both rose more than 8% Friday, as investors appeared unimpressed with Tesla's robotaxi unveiling, which could pose new competition to the app-based transportation platforms. Trump Media (DJT): Shares of the former president's media and tech company rose nearly 8% Friday morning, following an announced release of its Truth+ streaming app for Android devices on Thursday. The gains build on momentum from earlier in the week — its longest rally since June — as investors also assess Trump's standing in the presidential election. US stocks traveled without strong direction Friday morning as the big US banks kicked off earnings season and investors considered how a hotter-than-expected inflation report and unchanged wholesale inflation would steer Federal Reserve policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.4% in morning trading, paring deeper premarket losses as big bank financial updates rolled in. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ticked over the flat line, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3% after closing out Thursday with small losses. All three major gauges were on track for wins for the week. Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), JPMorgan (JPM), and BNY Mellon (BK) stocks rose Friday morning as investors cheered the first wave of bank earnings. Wells Fargo jumped 5% after its earnings per share handily beat Wall Street's forecasts. Its adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 surpassed the analyst consensus of $1.25 per share, according to Bloomberg data. Still, the bank reported a drop in net interest income and its profit fell 11%. BNY Mellon and BlackRock also surpassed Wall Street's forecasts. BNY Mellon ticked up 0.5% after posting a 16% jump in profit. BlackRock rose 1.7% after reporting a record of $11.5 trillion in assets. JPMorgan (JPM) rose 3.5% as its Wall Street operations beat expectations, even though profits fell, Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports. Read the full story on what JPM's third quarter results say about the US economy here. Trump Media (DJT) stock jumped 11% premarket Friday before paring gains as the company continues its week-long rally. DJT was up 6% to $25.66 after the bell. Shares jumped 17% during Thursday's session following the company's launch of its Truth+ streaming app, which makes Trump Media TV programming available to Android users. The stock's climb extended gains earlier this week as investors responded to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's surprise appearance at a Trump rally over the weekend, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reported. DJT is beginning to recover after hitting its lowest level since the social media company went public last month. Shares remain far below highs above $70 reached in March. The stock has been volatile and likened to a meme stock, with investors responding to the ups and downs of the former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign. Read Alexandra Canal's recent coverage of the stock here. Over a piece of braised short rib at the NYC Marriott Marquis last night, I got to sit among some amazing business news journalists at the annual Knight-Bagehot dinner and listen to a 20-minute chat between journalist Alan Murray and billionaire financier at Citadel, Ken Griffin. A lot of us in the room thought it was weird to see Griffin do the keynote fireside chat. A billionaire who got pulled through the mud during the meme stock craze waxing poetic about how reading Wall Street Journal articles about KKR's Henry Kravis when he was a teen inspired him to become a hedge fund king? The eye rolls were plentiful in the room. However, Griffin did give us journos some red meat at the end of the conversation. “I know who I am voting for, and it won’t be with a smile on my face,” Griffin said. I suppose that means Harris, but who knows! Reuters has the details, and Kathy Jones at the Schwab Center for Financial Research has some quick analysis: Tesla stock (TSLA) sank 6% premarket Friday as investors reacted to the EV maker's robotaxi unveiling. Elon Musk has lofty ideas about the future of Tesla's self-driving vehicles, and the recent event tested Wall Street's appetite for that vision. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports that the \"We, Robot\" event left investors wanting more. Musk unveiled a $30,000 autonomous \"Cybercab,\" arriving sometime in 2026. Tesla did not reveal its upcoming lower-cost “next-gen” model, which many analysts had expected, Subramanian reported. The sub-$30K next-gen EV will arrive later this year, Tesla has previously confirmed. Tesla stock has been on a wild ride recently, rising on prior hopes for the robotaxi unveiling before falling after the company's third quarter deliveries disappointed. Tesla shares are down 8% from last year. Uber stock (UBER), meanwhile, rose 5% in premarket trading. Read the full story on Tesla's robotaxi debut here. DETROIT (Reuters) — Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) confirmed on Thursday that CEO Carlos Tavares would retire at the end of his contract in early 2026 and announced major senior management changes as it struggles to turn around its lagging North American operations. Reasonable quarter out of JPMorgan (JPM) this morning. Read more from our banking reporter David Hollerith. I hopped on JPM's earnings media call and asked CFO Jeremy Barnum his views on housing post Fed rate cut. All in all, it didn't sound like a housing boom was taking shape with lower rates — but activity has picked up. Here's what Barnum told me (emphasis ours): “What we did see, as you kind of would expect, is a pickup in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of increase in refinancings there, which, again, you would also expect. But it's worth noting, when it comes to mortgages, that all of the sequential and year-on-year changes are coming off a very low base, and it remains the case that the vast majority of the stock of outstanding mortgages right now in this country are below 6% with a lot of them still even below 5%. So it would take a really big rally in the long end of the yield curve to see a significant pickup in refinancing. The house view on home prices, you know, I think generally you've got a tension there between possibly a slightly weakening economy that should create a little bit more supply, there's a little bit more construction, but there's generally a housing shortage in this country. So the housing market seems to me is still a little bit stuck, I would say.” ",

        "body": "Celero Commerce, the payments company backed by LLR Partners, is up for sale and has hired an investment bank to advise on the process, according to four banking and private equity executives. The execs predict the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company could sell for roughly $600 million, or 12 times Celero’s trailing Ebitda of $50 million. Celero is in the “back half’ of a process that has attracted private equity, they said. LLR, a lower middle market PE firm, formed Celero in late 2018 when it invested in UMS Banking, a merchant acquirer. Celero has remained very acquisitive, buying about 10 companies since then, including RazorSync in 2019, TransNational Payments in 2020, and this past August, it scooped up SONA. LLR and Celero did not return messages for comment. News of the Celero sale comes as mergers remain slow. The number of U.S. announced transactions so far this year has dropped about 8% to 7,993, totaling $1.2 trillion as of Oct. 7, according to data from Dealogic. That figure represents a 17% jump in value compared to 2023 when 8,660 mergers totaled $1 trillion, according to Dealogic. While there are lots of discussions going on, sales are harder to get done this year, one fintech banker said. Mergers typically slow down ahead of the U.S. presidential election with many expecting deals to return next year. “Buyers aren’t ready to spend on these M&A situations as easily as they used to in the past. That’s the issue,” one banker said. In another fintech development, Finexio, the payments startup backed by JPMorgan, is seeking a minority round of capital, according to three banking sources. Finexio has hired an investment bank to advise on the fundraise, they said. In 2015, Ernest Rolfson, a former Mastercard executive, founded Finexio, which seeks to simplify the accounts payable process for medium and large companies. The company provides software that converts paper checks to electronic payments. Finexio has introduced a Card by Mail product which seeks to blend the comfort of paper checks with the efficiency of digital payments, according to an April blog post. Despite the shift to digital, some businesses continue to use legacy payment methods. About 75% of organizations use paper checks despite the high costs, according to a study from PYMNTS Intelligence. Finexio has raised about $83.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. JPMorgan, an active fintech acquirer, was the largest investor of Finexio’s $35 million B round that it raised in October 2022. Discover Financial Services and Valley Bank also took part. The B round valued Finexio at $100 million. (Capital One’s more than $35 billion buy of Discover is expected to close later this year or early 2025.)   "

The world's largest bank by market cap posted revenue of $42.65 billion, well above the $39.87 billion it reported a year ago and the $40.85 billion consensus estimate of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha. Reported net interest income (NII) rose to $23.41 billion from $22.73 billion. Profit fell slightly to $12.9 billion from $13.15 billion, but edged higher to $4.37 from $4.33 on a per-share basis. Analysts were expecting $11.81 billion, or $3.97 per share. JPMorgan shares, which had risen about 25% this year through Thursday's close, were up just under 2% in premarket trading after the report's release. Higher interest rates in recent years helped JPMorgan and other banks reach record levels of net interest income, but rising deposit costs have impacted bank earnings in recent quarters while loan growth has stalled. JPMorgan and other banks are reporting earnings amid a shifting economic environment, as the Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the first time since 2020. Analysts expect that the newly lowered rates and potential for future cuts should help lower deposit costs and spark more investment banking and loan growth in the coming quarters. Analyst and investor attention has also focused recently on how JPMorgan will form a succession plan for 68-year-old Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jamie Dimon. The influential executive has said in recent months that the bank wants to make sure it gets the plan right when he steps away in the coming years. Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 26 cents per share ($1.04 a year). To earn $500 monthly from the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm, start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Bank of America's $1.04 dividend: $6,000 / $1.04 = 5,769 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $230,587 worth of Bank of America, or 5,769 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares, or $46,125 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). View more earnings on BAC Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. Price Action: Shares of Bank of America fell by 0.6% to close at $39.97 on Thursday. The firm will release earnings results for its third quarter before the opening bell on Tuesday, Oct. 15, Analysts expect Bank of America to report quarterly earnings at 77 cents per share.

Here’s where and when to see them Candy and snack recall, FDA update: List of products that may be contaminated with salmonella After hitting a 16-month low of 6.11% in early September, the average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate tracked by Mortgage News Daily has ticked back up, reaching 6.62% on Tuesday. That increase will likely dampen some of the refinancing activity, which had started to gain a bit of momentum as some borrowers with 7% and 8% mortgage rates took the opportunity to get some relief. According to a new survey by John Burns Research and Consulting (JBREC), neither the 6.11% rate nor today’s 6.62% was going to do too much to motivate homeowners who would like to sell but are staying put because of mortgage rates. At what mortgage rate level would resale turnover—currently hovering at multi-decade lows—really pick up? The “magic mortgage rate” that JBREC says would truly unlock the housing market is below 5.5%. The research firm has held this view for a while and reaffirmed it last week, citing its September 2024 survey. Only 13% of homeowners surveyed by JBREC said they would accept a mortgage rate between 6.5% and 6.99% on their next home. But 47% said they would accept a mortgage rate between 5.0% and 5.5%. Why have mortgage rates bounced up over the past week? The latest employment reports have come in a bit warmer than expected, with the U.S. unemployment rate falling from 4.3% in July 2024 to 4.1% in September 2024. After rising from the cycle low of 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.3% in July 2024, some analysts were concerned this could signal a sharp labor market slowdown or recession. However, the latest jobs numbers have eased those fears somewhat and placed a little upward pressure on long-term yields, including mortgage rates.

The U.S. producer price index for final demand was unchanged in September, slightly below the forecast of economists polled by Reuters for a gain of 0.1%. It followed an unrevised 0.2% increase in August, indicating inflation continues to cool and giving the Fed leeway to continue cutting interest rates. In the 12 months through September, the PPI increased 1.8% versus the 1.6% estimate. On Thursday, the consumer price index turned out to be slightly higher than expected as goods costs increased. The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 68.9 this month, compared with a final reading of 70.1 in September and below the 70.8 estimate as high prices discouraged shopping. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks advanced, with the Dow and S&P 500 closing at record highs, as bank shares jumped 4.21%, its biggest daily percentage gain since May 2023, at the start of the quarterly earnings season. JP Morgan rose 4.44% and Wells Fargo shot up 5.61%. \"As we get to the latter part of this year and into next year, you're going to see earnings growth in the broader market and not just a small group of stocks and what the banks are telling us today is that's happening,\" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Amundi U.S. in Boston. \"Banks have been as big a question mark as anybody - the level of rates, the yield curve, capital markets activity, et cetera - and two of our biggest banks today are saying well everything's going to be pretty good.\" S&P 500 earnings growth is expected to be 4.9%, LSEG data showed, down slightly from 5.2% at the start of October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 409.74 points, or 0.97%, to 42,863.86, the S&P 500 rose 34.98 points, or 0.61%, to 5,815.03 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 60.89 points, or 0.33%, to 18,342.94. Gains were capped, however, by an 8.78% tumble in Tesla shares as the electric vehicle maker promised much at its robotaxi event with few practical details. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 4.56 points, or 0.54%, to 852.75 and was on track for its fourth weekly gain in five weeks. In Europe, the STOXX 600 index closed up 0.55% as investors shifted their focus to China's fiscal stimulus, corporate earnings seasons and the European Central Bank's (ECB) expected rate cut next week.

        "body": "Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 7% Friday midday as investors signaled disappointment over the EV maker’s robotaxi debut. Following the event on Thursday night, “We, Robot” — which aimed to cement CEO Elon Musk’s position as an AI leader — investors and analysts came away with more skepticism than excitement over Tesla’s lofty vision for a future of driverless cabs. Jefferies (JEF) analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets\" with “little evidence of feasibility.” “We believe TSLA potentially underappreciates the obstacles to scaling a robotaxi fleet,” they wrote. Tesla’s new Cybercab has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous, Yahoo Finance’s Pras Subramanian reported. The company said it will begin unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) trials with Model 3 and Model Y test vehicles next year in Texas and California. Tesla is aiming to begin Cybercab production “before 2027,” Musk said. Tesla’s stock drop on Friday extended a two-week decline. TSLA shares fell last week after the company missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. The stock — which has experienced far more volatility over the past year than its Magnificent Seven peers — is down 17% from last year. Still, TSLA’s Friday price of $220 per share is far higher than lows below $140 this spring. Shares hit a 15-month low in April amid Tesla’s layoffs and price cuts. Investors and analysts had hoped the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event would live up to the hype but were disappointed by Musk’s lack of clarity over how the company would achieve its ambitious goals. Raymond James (RJF) analyst Josh Beck called Tesla’s plan to commercialize its Cybercabs “vague” and “underwhelming.” Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts said the event included a “disappointing lack of detail” about updates to Tesla's FSD technology and market strategy. RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan concurred, writing in a note Friday that investors believe Musk’s vision “was light of real numbers and timelines.” “These typically come at Tesla events,” he added. “This one seemed focused on branding and marketing Tesla's vision, rather than giving concrete numbers for us to model out.” Additionally, Tesla did not reveal details about a lower-priced vehicle as some investors had hoped. That vehicle is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, analysts noted. To be sure, some experts on Wall Street think “We, Robot” was a success. Bank of America analysts said the robotaxi event “lived up to the hype.”           ",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The way Jeff deGraaf sees it, hedge funds that sold a record amount of Chinese shares earlier this week toward the end of the CSI 300’s 10-day, 35% surge are in for a world of regret. Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? In fact, says the co-founder and chief executive officer of Renaissance Macro Research, rarely in his more than three-decade Wall Street career have the stars aligned so perfectly for a lengthy rally. “Skepticism, valuation, stimulus, momentum and a trend change,” they’re all there, he said in an interview. It’s because of that backdrop that the Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch veteran is now one of the biggest China bulls on Wall Street. He predicts the country’s benchmark gauge will hit 6,000 in the next 12 months, a more than 50% advance. DeGraaf, who ranked as the top technical analyst in Institutional Investor’s annual survey for 11 straight years through 2015, says that it’s no coincidence that Beijing rolled out its most aggressive monetary easing in years as equities tested their year-to-date lows last month. “Markets drive policy as much as policy drives markets,” he said. His forecast compares with Morgan Stanley’s newly revised CSI 300 target of 4,000 by June 2025, implying virtually no upside from Thursday’s close. The index plunged 7.1% on Wednesday, the second day mainland markets reopened after the Golden Week holidays. While it rose 1% Thursday, enthusiasm over a stimulus-driven equity surge is cooling due to the lack of any further major initiatives at a key policy meeting earlier this week. DeGraaf recommends investors “keep stops in place and don’t get dogmatic” when wagering on China. For now, traders are awaiting the outcome of a finance ministry briefing on fiscal policy due Saturday. “We see the policy response as self-preservation, a reaction to the weakness and a potential Mario Draghi-esque ‘Do what it takes’ moment for China,” deGraaf said. The former Lehman chief technical analyst also downplayed potential risks to Chinese shares from the upcoming US presidential election. It’s a “side show, probably doesn’t matter much, and a reaction would be an opportunity,” he said.

        "body": "Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) will release earnings results for its third quarter before the opening bell on Friday, Oct. 11. Analysts expect the San Francisco-based bank to report quarterly earnings at $1.28 per share, down from $1.48 per share in the year-ago period. Wells Fargo projects to report revenue of $20.41 billion for the recent quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Some Wells Fargo investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Wells Fargo currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.78%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share ($1.60 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Wells Fargo, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Wells Fargo's $1.60 dividend: $6,000 / $1.60 = 3,750 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $215,775 worth of Wells Fargo, or 3,750 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.60 = 750 shares, or $43,155 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. View more earnings on WFC The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.  Price Action: Shares of Wells Fargo gained by 0.4% to close at $57.54 on Wednesday. On Oct. 8, Wolfe Research analyst Steven Chubak upgraded Wells Fargo from Peer Perform to Outperform and announced a $65 price target.

        "body": "By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -The S&P 500 and the Dow scored record closing highs on Friday, with the big boosts from financial stocks after banks reported strong quarterly results while the latest inflation data fueled expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut in November. Major financial companies kicked off earnings season with JPMorgan Chase finishing the session up 4.4% after the lender reported higher-than-expected third-quarter profit and raised its annual interest income forecast. Shares in Wells Fargo rallied 5.6% after its profit also beat analysts' expectations. BlackRock stock gained 3.6% after the asset manager reported that its assets under management had hit a record high for the third straight quarter. Other stocks in the industry rose broadly, making the S&P 500 Financials index the biggest index points boost for the benchmark. \"We'd some good earnings reports from some leading financial companies. That's a good start to earnings season,\" said Evan Brown, Portfolio Manager and Head of Multi-Asset Strategy, UBS Asset Management, adding that it bodes well for the economy. \"When financials do well, this is what a soft landing looks like. It's a positive overall sign for the economy and sets a positive tone for earnings releases in other industries in the next few weeks.\" For the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 409.74 points, or 0.97%, to 42,863.86, the S&P 500 gained 34.98 points, or 0.61%, to 5,815.03 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 60.89 points, or 0.33%, to 18,342.94. For the week, the S&P 500 added 1.1% while the Dow climbed 1.2% and the Nasdaq added 1.1% with all three notching their fifth weekly gain in a row. Earlier in the day, data from the U.S. Department of Labor showed the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand was unchanged on a monthly basis in September, compared to the 0.1% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters. Friday's PPI data follows Thursday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, which was slightly higher than forecast, although weekly jobless claims rose more than expected. \"The market's pretty convinced that we're going to have a soft landing and that inflation, even with CPI being a little bit higher than expected yesterday, is going to be moderate,\" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. \"If you look at today's PPI data, the core and final demand were both a little lower than expected ... Inflation's certainly been moderating and that's a positive that the market paid attention to.\"         ",

        "body": "The stock market has been on a tear in 2024, with the S&P 500 rising by nearly 21 percent over the first three quarters of the year. But the situation may not be so brisk over the coming 12 months, say analysts in Bankrate’s Third-Quarter Market Mavens Survey. These pros expect the market to rise just 4.1 percent over the coming four quarters, below its long-term annual average of 10 percent. The survey’s respondents see the S&P 500 climbing from 5,738 at the end of the survey period to 5,975 by the end of the third quarter of 2025. It’s the 16th straight survey where the analysts have projected a gain in the year ahead. The analysts also preferred U.S. stocks over international ones, and they think value stocks will outperform growth stocks over a similar time frame. “Reflecting multiple sources of uncertainty, there are some reasons to be cautious about the outlook,” says Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst. “Even so, the resilience of the U.S. economy and the stock market’s ability to power through multiple threats taken together have been nothing short of remarkable.” Here are the highlights from Bankrate’s quarterly Market Mavens Survey. This article is one in a series discussing the results of Bankrate’s Third-Quarter 2024 Market Mavens Survey: Survey: Market strategists see 10-year Treasury yield at 3.5% a year from now Best moves for long-term investors with stocks near all-time highs, according to market experts Stock market outlook for the next 12 months: Here’s what top analysts are predicting into 2025 The S&P 500 has had a really strong run since the start of 2023, and while it’s definitely had some hiccups in 2024, this year has been notably strong, too. But the market pros surveyed by Bankrate expected more muted returns over the next 12 months. The average estimate for the S&P 500 is 5,975 for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2025 — up 4.1 percent from 5,738 at the end of the recent survey period on Sept. 27, 2024. In the second-quarter survey, analysts estimated a similar 4 percent gain in the year ahead. “The major averages have fared remarkably well even when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates to the highest levels in years,” says Hamrick. “Now that the central bank has begun an easing cycle, the notion ‘don’t fight the Fed’ should provide some reassurance. At the same time, the Fed’s mandate has nothing to do with preserving stock market gains or momentum.” “It looks like the Fed can avoid recession, but it’s much too early to have great conviction,” says Michael K. Farr, president and CEO, Farr, Miller & Washington.                                       "

The company also announced updated Phase 1b data on ACTengine IMA203 TCR-T targeting PRAME in melanoma patients and provided an update on SUPRAME, the upcoming Phase 3 trial to evaluate IMA203 in metastatic melanoma patients. As of August 23, 2024, 28 heavily pretreated patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with IMA203 at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D, 1 to 10 billion total TCR-T cells) during the Phase 1b dose expansion part of the clinical trial. IMA203 monotherapy has maintained a favorable tolerability profile with no treatment-related Grade 5 adverse events in the safety population, even at doses up to ~10×10 power 9 TCR-T cells. The data presented demonstrate a significant positive shift in median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) between melanoma patients treated during Phase 1a and patients treated in Phase 1b. In addition, approximately half of all patients in the Phase 1b trial have a deep response (>50% tumor reduction). This subgroup of patients was observed to have a median PFS of more than one year, while patients with <50% tumor reduction (including patients with tumor size increase) were still observed with a more than 2 times longer median PFS compared to patients treated in dose escalation with suboptimal doses. Translational data from patients across Phase 1a and Phase 1b indicate that IMA203 T cells rapidly engrafted in all patients after a single dose and show a persistence of more than two years. The Phase 3 trial will evaluate IMA203 targeting PRAME in 360 HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with second-line or later unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The Phase 3 trial is on track to commence in December 2024 and patient enrollment is forecasted to be completed in 2026. A pre-specified interim analysis is planned for early 2026. The company aims to submit an FDA marketing application in early 2027 for full approval. Price Action: IMTX stock is down 11.1% at $9.841 at last check Thursday.

        "body": "We talk about the digital economy, or the consumer economy, and even sometimes about the manufacturing sector – but the truth is, these are all interrelated and cannot be fully atomized. The glue that holds them together is the transport sector, the unsung transportation companies that move people and goods wherever they are wanted and needed. This is big business. According to Mordor Intelligence, the US freight and logistics sector will total more than $1.33 trillion this year, and reach $1.67 trillion by the end of the decade. While freight and transportation stocks are vulnerable to cyclical changes and headwinds – demand can be fickle, consumer desires can change – there is always a need for freight and transport services. Indeed, Citi analyst Ari Rosa is telling investors that the transport sector is primed for gains going forward, writing in a recent note: “We believe select Transportation and Logistics stocks are well-positioned to deliver strong relative outperformance in the year ahead. This view is supported by our analysis that suggests the cyclical downturn in transports is in its late stages, with rates and margins near trough, offering the prospect of strong earnings growth in 2025 and into 2026 as rates recover…” “In our view,” adds Rosa, “investors should be positioned for a cyclical recovery, with attractive opportunities in companies that are leveraged to realize outsized benefits as freight conditions tighten.” With this outlook in mind, Rosa has pinpointed two top transportation stocks for investors to keep an eye on. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve taken a deeper dive to assess whether these picks truly hold up. JB Hunt (JBHT) First on the list is JB Hunt, the $16.8 billion trucking and logistics firm founded in Arkansas back in 1961. Today, JB Hunt is the 12th largest transport company, of any type, in the US – and one of the five largest trucking companies. The company has brought a 21st-century business approach to the trucking sector, investing heavily in its people, its technology, and its transport capacity to build out North America’s most efficient transport network. JB Hunt offers a wide range of trucking and transport services, including intermodal freight, moving containers from rail to truck and truck to rail; dedicated trucking, offering contract fleet services to enterprise customers; full truckload and less-than-truckload shipping and contract shipping services; and even ‘last mile’ delivery. These are the mainstays of the trucking sector, making freight delivery scalable, flexible, and timely – and JB Hunt has proven expertise at all of them.                ",

The jobs report dashed hopes of another jumbo 50-basis point cut, but the slight upside surprise in CPI likely isn't enough to prompt a complete pause on Fed easing. \"There is only one more set of inflation reports between now and then, and even a firm upside surprise could be discounted as normal monthly volatility on the path back toward the 2% target,\" JPMorgan analysts said in a Friday note after the jobs report. Investors now see a 25-basis point rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month more likely compared to leaving rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Weekly jobless claims, meanwhile, climbed 33,000 to 258,000, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That surpassed forecasts of 230,000 and marks the data point's highest level in over a year. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: S&P 500: 5,774.06, down 0.32% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 42,429.01, down 0.2% (-82.99 points) Nasdaq composite: 18,218.14, down 0.41% Here's what else was going on Thursday: FEMA was strapped for cash even before Hurricanes Helene and Milton blew through the South.

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose to records Friday as big banks rallied following a run of reassuring profit reports. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to top its all-time high set earlier in the week and close out its fifth straight winning week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 409 points, or 1%, to set its own record. The Nasdaq composite lagged the market with a gain of 0.3% after a slide for Tesla kept it in check. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other things. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. It was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500. CEO Jamie Dimon said the nation’s largest bank is also still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, but the pace is modest “given that market levels are at least slightly inflated.” BlackRock, meanwhile, rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 8.8% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the “Cybercab,” potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.98 points to 5,815.03. The Dow rallied 409.74 to 42,863.86, and the Nasdaq composite gained 60.89 to 18,342.94. Another automaker, Stellantis, saw its European-traded shares sink 2.8% after it announced some significant leadership changes, including the timing of CEO Carlos Tavares’ retirement. Its chief financial officer is also departing as the company formed by the merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler struggles to revive sales in North America. In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed following the latest updates on inflation at the wholesale level and on sentiment among U.S. consumers. Prices paid by producers were 1.8% higher in September than a year earlier. That was an improvement from August’s year-over-year inflation level, but not as much as economists expected. Analysts said it likely helped calm worries stirred a day earlier, when a report showed inflation at the consumer level wasn’t cooling as quickly as economists expected.           ",

        "body": "Second-quarter earnings at supply chain software provider E2open were negative enough that investors heavily sold off stock Thursday after management tried to put a positive spin on the company’s outlook. At approximately 11:15 a.m. EDT,  E2open (NYSE: ETWO) stock was down about 75 cents per share to $3.32, a drop of 18.4%. It was not a 52-week low for the company; that mark was set with a price of $2.15 almost one year ago exactly at the time it was pushing its CEO out the door. Among the key numbers that investors may have found discouraging was subscription revenue of $131.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. However, that figure was not surprising and actually came toward the high end of the guidance range of $129 million to $132 million that had been provided by the company. But it appears to be the company’s guidance going forward that set off the drop in E2open’s stock price. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, subscription revenue is expected to be $130 million to $133 million. CFO Marj Armstrong said on the conference call with analysts that the figure would represent a drop of 2.1% on the low end from the prior year to an increase of 0.2% on the high end. But she also said E2open expects to have higher “booking and customer retention metrics” in the third quarter sequentially from the second quarter. For all of fiscal 2025, E2open now expects its subscription revenue to be $526 million to $532 million, which would be a negative 2% to negative 1% growth rate. Total revenue for the  company would be $607 million to $616 million, which would be a negative 4% to negative 3% rate compared to the prior year. The continuing weak fiscal performance at E2open comes several months after it announced it was launching a “strategic review” of its future. That announcement in March followed activist investor Elliott Management’s disclosure a few days after that 52-week low a year ago that it had taken a greater-than-13% stake in the company through outright equity ownership and an options position. On the earnings call, CEO Andrew Appel, who has been in the seat since February, said that review was “ongoing.” “Our directors are committed to a careful and thorough evaluation of the options we have available to us,” he said, adding that he would not comment further on the review. The lagging performance of E2open led to the dismissal of Appel’s predecessor, Michael Farlekas, a year ago about the time that 52-week low was reached. Appel was named interim CEO at that time – he had been a director – before being made permanent CEO in February.                 "

The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts The People’s Bank of China will accept applications from eligible securities firms, funds and insurers starting Thursday to obtain highly liquid assets such as government bonds and central bank bills if they provide certain collateral. The size of the tool is 500 billion yuan ($70.6 billion) and can be expanded in the future, the monetary authority said in a statement. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng unveiled the mechanism as part of a stimulus bonanza last month that signaled the government’s intent to draw a line under the slowing economy. The moves fueled a world-beating rally that saw shares rise as much as 30%. The funds obtained through the facility can only go toward investment in the stock market, Pan said at the time. Bonds, stock ETFs, CSI 300 constituent shares and other assets could be used as collateral, the PBOC said Thursday. The latest announcement comes as the stock rally cools on the lack of immediate fiscal stimulus following a weeklong national holiday. Investors are now awaiting a press briefing by Finance Minister Lan Fo’an on Saturday to watch for clues of any steps to boost government borrowing and spending to shore up growth. The CSI 300 Index rebounded on Thursday from a heavy selloff the previous day. It finished up 1.1% at the close, after gyrating between gains and losses earlier. Insurers are likely to be the first to apply for the liquidity tool, partly because their equity holdings match the collateral requirements made by the PBOC, according to Wu Xuan, fund manager at Borui Funds Management. Regulators see insurance funds as a key source of long-term investment into the market, he said. “They are shouldering more of a ‘political task,’” said Wu. “I would expect more details over the coming weeks and the first batch using the tool within two-three months.” Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., said the policy is expected to support the market, although she wouldn’t link the timing to the performance of stocks.

September's producer price index was flat, calming inflation concerns amid rising yields. US stocks jumped on Friday, with all three major averages notching a five-week win streak. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs on Friday. The session marked the S&P 500's 45th record closing high this year and the first time the benchmark index climbed above 5,800. The gains came after US mega-banks JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reported upbeat third-quarter results that showed no signs of an imminent consumer slowdown. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release but warned that geopolitical conditions are \"treacherous and getting worse.\" Dimon has long warned investors about rising geopolitical risks. Also helping stocks on Friday was a light print for September's wholesale inflation gauge. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. The cool PPI report came a day after the CPI report was slightly hotter than expected. \"CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk's EV company has returned to being the most shorted stock in the United States. Weakening fundamentals and discounting measures top the list of analyst concerns.  Tesla (TSLA) bulls have robotaxi fever. Shorts are betting they'll be disappointed. As the EV giant prepares to unveil its robotaxi at its much-anticipated event Thursday, the company has found another way to grab the headlines: Elon Musk's company has returned to its old position as the most shorted stock in the U.S. Meanwhile, the stock has been included in Wells Fargo’s latest trading ideas with an underweight call—and skepticism that the robotaxi will deliver on bulls' presumptions. According to data and tech firm Hazeltree, Elon Musk's EV company was the most crowded shorted large-cap security in the Americas in September, returning to a position it held until July. Investors would be less interested in the company—whose stock price has largely recovered from the losses it experienced in the first half of the year—as demand for EVs cooled, though the excitement around the robotaxi could give the stock a boost. Tesla stock is up more than 40% since April 5, when Musk announced plans for the robotaxi event, and it has stayed elevated even after the event was delayed. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan, however, has given Tesla a $120 price target—half its current price—in the bank's tactical trading ideas list for the fourth quarter. Langan wrote that he is skeptical Wednesday's event will “match the high expectations from Tesla bulls, leaving investors to focus on weakening fundamentals.\" Those fundamentals include projections for moderating delivery growth as EV demand drops and the limited potential of discounting to boost sales. He also noted that Musk has promised robotaxis \"by year-end...for years\" but \"experts say the technology is years away & that TSLA’s autonomous technology comes with considerable safety concerns.\" Last week's delivery data sent Tesla stock lower despite beating expectations, as analysts said investors may have wanted Tesla to deliver a stronger quarter. Tesla said Wednesday that its third-quarter results will be released after the market closes on Oct. 23. Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

Let’s take a look at how Werner (NASDAQ:WERN) and the rest of the ground transportation stocks fared in Q2. The growth of e-commerce and global trade continues to drive demand for shipping services, especially last-mile delivery, presenting opportunities for ground transportation companies. The industry continues to invest in data, analytics, and autonomous fleets to optimize efficiency and find the most cost-effective routes. Despite the essential services this industry provides, ground transportation companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies’ offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins. The 16 ground transportation stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1%. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. While some ground transportation stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.1% since the latest earnings results. Conducting business in over a 100 countries, Werner (NASDAQ:WERN) offers full-truckload, less-than-truckload, and intermodal delivery services. Werner reported revenues of $760.8 million, down 6.2% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 1.2%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. “While industry-wide headwinds remain, second quarter earnings improved sequentially, and we made progress on controlling the controllables. One-Way Truckload production increased for the fifth consecutive quarter. Mexico and cross-border related business is growing double-digits. Dedicated revenue per truck was up, and Logistics segment returned to positive operating income,” said Derek Leathers, Chairman and CEO.                     ",

Despite the stormy weather and Middle East anxiety, U.S. economic soundings remain robust and Federal Reserve easing expectations continue to be dialled back - sending the dollar to near two month highs in the process. With the U.S. economy estimated to be still expanding at more than 3%, markets now seeing little more than an 80% chance of another Fed rate cut next month and the whole rate futures curve has backed up some 50 basis points over the past month. That puts a notional Fed 'terminal rate' closer to 3.5% - well above the 2.9% long-term 'neutral' rate Fed policymakers indicated at their last meeting. Minutes of that meeting late Wednesday showed a \"substantial majority\" of officials supported a half-point rate cut to start the easing cycle, but there appeared to be agreement the first move would not commit the Fed to any particular pace thereafter. A stream of Fed speakers this week seem to back that up. \"Two more cuts this year, or one more cut this year, really spans the range of what is likely in my mind,\" San Francisco Fed boss Mary Daly said overnight. After a lacklustre 10-year Treasury note auction on Wednesday, 10-year yields climbed to their highest since July and both two and 10-year yields have now got a foothold back above 4%. Perhaps more concerning for the Fed is creeping market inflation expectations, with so-called 'breakeven' expectations from the 10-year inflation-protected securities markets rising to near three-month highs at 2.3% - nearly 30 basis points higher than they were a month ago. And more worryingly ahead of next month's election, the U.S. Treasury 10-year term premium, a measure of the compensation investors demand to hold long-term government debt securities, moved back into positive territory this week. That spins attention into today's critical consumer price report, where headline annual CPI inflation is expected to ease to 2.3% - its lowest in more than three years - but with 'core' inflation stickier around 3.2%. \"I continue to see a meaningful risk that inflation could get stuck above our 2% goal,\" Dallas Fed chief Lorie Logan said on Wednesday, adding that the Fed \"should not rush to reduce the fed funds target to a 'normal' or 'neutral' level\".

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? A Florida investor was quietly snapping up the company’s stock, buying so much that by Monday he disclosed owning a more than 18% stake — making him the second-biggest shareholder after Leonard Green & Partners, the Los Angeles private equity firm. The move set off alarms at The Container Store’s headquarters: On Tuesday, the company announced that it enacted a so-called poison-pill provision, a method used to ward off unwanted takeovers by making them prohibitively expensive, after the “rapid and significant accumulation” of its shares by a single stockholder. But it turns out Amit Agarwal is no would-be Carl Icahn. He’s a 41-year-old former patent litigator in St. Petersburg, Florida, who works out of the local Subway sandwich shop and likes placing big bets in the stock market and at the poker table. He’s put down $8 million wagering there’s solid potential in the financially struggling retailer — especially if a real buyout artist comes out of the woodwork. “There’s a gem inside this pile of mess and it will shine brightly enough to capture a buyer’s attention,” he said. But, he added: “I could be wrong.” The Container Store, a nationwide chain known for its closet organizers, storage shelves and container bins, has stumbled so badly that even a hobbyist like Agarwal was able to buy a big piece of it. Its stock surged during the Covid lockdowns — when amateur investors were piling into companies that were expected to benefit — only to tumble some 96% since March 2021, cutting its market value to less than $40 million. The company is now contending with a difficult combination: declining revenues, a run of losses and a pile of debt that’s maturing in 2025 and 2026. In May, the company said it hired Latham & Watkins and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to consider strategic alternatives, which typically involves soliciting takeover offers or mulling other steps to deal with financial distress. On Wall Street, the few analysts who still track the company are skeptical of its prospects: One advises selling the shares; the other two deem it a hold. None are suggesting clients buy it. In July, S&P Global Ratings downgraded The Container Store to CCC+, deep into junk grade, seeing mounting risks it will be pushed to default on its debts.                      ",

        "body": "Monzo is now valued at $5.9 billion after the U.K.-based challenger bank confirmed a secondary market share sale to provide liquidity for its employees. The transaction, first rumored yesterday, saw existing investors such as Singapore's sovereign wealth fund (GIC) and StepStone Group procuring additional shares in the London-based fintech. A secondary market sale essentially rewards employees for getting a company to where it is, without having to go public — or, at least, buying it more time. It has been an action-packed year for Monzo. The company raised $190 million in May, just two months after kicking off a $425 million Series I round that saw Alphabet's CapitalG and sister VC firm GV making a rare co-investment. The startup has now raised around $1.5 billion since its foundation nine years ago. At the time of its March fundraise, Monzo said its pre-money valuation was £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion), implying a post-money valuation of £4 billion ($5 billion) -- this valuation rose slightly with the second tranche that followed in May. The following month, Monzo reported its first full-year (pre-tax) profit, with its revenues more than doubling from the previous year. The company claims 20% of U.K. adults as customers as well as 6% of businesses in the country. This growth, coupled with a roadmap that includes a wider European expansion and plans to accelerate its rollout in the U.S market where it appointed a new CEO last October, has clearly been deemed sufficient for a valuation bump in the past five months. Rival U.K. neobank Revolut recently confirmed a new valuation of $45 billion via a similar secondary market sale, shortly after securing its own banking license in the U.K. and Mexico. \"It’s great to be able to provide employees with some liquidity, while meeting further investor demand for Monzo equity,\" Monzo CEO TS Anil said in a statement.

Beyond what’s commonly known — that a lot of the fundings today are insider rounds and bridge financings aimed at keeping companies alive — cash back to the limited partners (LPs) who fund venture firms has slowed to the global financial crisis levels of 16 years ago. Meanwhile, with LPs snapping shut their checkbooks as their returns slow, the number of VCs and angel investors investing in a startup in the first quarter of this year fell to just 45.5% of those who were striking deals in 2021. Pressure is building. VCs are sitting on unicorns that now account for $2.5 trillion in value, says PitchBook -- and nearly 40% of these have been in their VCs’ portfolio for at least nine years. Overall, the backlog of companies yet to exit has ballooned to 57,674, a record high, with late-stage companies accounting for 32.4% of those outfits. "

Starboard Value said they had scheduled a meeting with CEO Albert Bourla, Shantanu Narayen, and potentially other Board members on October 16. They plan to share their perspectives and discuss Pfizer’s future direction. Also Read: Former Pfizer Executives Ian Read And Frank D’Amelio Support Albert Bourla’s Leadership Amid Starboard Activism: ‘Will Deliver Shareholder Value.’ The letter highlights recent press reports that Starboard reached out to the company’s former CEO, Ian Read, and former CFO, Frank D’Amelio, as part of their due diligence process. Both Mr. Read and Mr. D’Amelio expressed concerns regarding Pfizer’s current trajectory. As former executives and significant individual shareholders with a strong understanding of Pfizer’s stakeholders, they conveyed a shared desire for the company to pursue a more promising course and offered assistance. The letter states that interaction with the former executives has been limited to this, which aligns with publicly available information. The letter adds that individuals within Pfizer or their representatives have allegedly contacted Mr. Read and Mr. D’Amelio, threatening legal action, the recovery of prior compensation, and the cancellation of unvested performance stock units unless they publicly support the current CEO. The shareholder urges the Board to establish a special committee of impartial members to investigate the matter, determine who authorized such actions, and hold the responsible parties accountable. Concurrently, Pfizer released topline results from the final prespecified overall survival (OS) analysis of the TALAPRO-2 study of Talzenna (talazoparib) in combination with Xtandi (enzalutamide) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the final OS in all-comers (cohort 1) and in patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC (cohort 2) compared to Xtandi alone. At the time of the final analysis, the clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) was maintained in both cohorts from the prior primary analysis previously reported and published in The Lancet. The FDA approved Talzenna in combination with Xtandi for adult patients with HRR gene-mutated mCRPC in June 2023. The European Commission also approved the combination in January 2024 for adult patients with mCRPC whose chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.          ",

Polyester, described as the largest driver of this growth, has replaced cotton as the \"most widely used fibre in the world\" since the mid to late 2000s. The report noted that global fibre production per person has also increased significantly, growing from 8.3 kilograms per person in 1975 to 15.5 kilograms per person in 2023, with this figure expected to rise to 18.8 kilograms per person by 2030 if business continues as usual.

Polyester led the market with a 57% share, followed by polyamide (nylon) at 5%, while other synthetic fibres combined for an additional 5%. Plant-based fibres made up about 25% of the global fibre market in 2023. Cotton was the second-most produced fibre globally, with 24.7 million tonnes, representing 20% of total fibre production.

AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors. But not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities. Covering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology. So, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy. Meta Platforms We’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted. Meta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations. Solid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.

        "body": "By Helen Reid LONDON (Reuters) - IKEA annual sales fell 5% after the Swedish budget homeware retailer cut prices in a bid to attract more shoppers and maintain its share of a shrinking home furniture market, but it expects a recovery next year. Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores globally, reported 39.6 billion euros ($43.3 billion) in sales for its financial year ended Aug. 31. \"In all our markets we experienced a slowdown of the economy and a slowdown of the home furnishing industry, almost simultaneously,\" said Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group. \"We never experienced anything like that since 2008, to be honest.\" After seeing a decline in store visits and sold quantities, IKEA decided to cut prices, which boosted footfall and the amount of products sold, Brodin said. Ingka Group said it invested more than 2.1 billion euros in price cuts across its markets, and its share of the global home furnishing market stayed steady at 5.7%. IKEA has benefited from households trading down as a global property slowdown hurt confidence, said Tolga Oncu, retail manager at Ingka Group. For 2025, IKEA expects a boost to sales as lower interest rates drive more people to move house, which usually prompts buying of beds, sofas, and bookcases. Store visits increased by 3.3% to 727 million this year, slower than the 7.4% growth seen in 2023 and new openings fell to 41, from 60. Ingka plans 58 new locations worldwide in its 2025 financial year. Its share of sales made online increased to 28%, up from 26% in 2023. NOT GOING OUT AT CHRISTMAS This holiday season, like last year, Oncu expects people to spend more time hosting at home rather than going out, with budgets still constrained by inflation. Inter IKEA Group, which owns the IKEA brand and manufactures the products, reported annual sales of 45.1 billion euros ($49.3 billion) across all franchisees, of which Ingka Group is the biggest. That was down 5.3% compared to 2023, largely due to price cuts as the cost of raw materials like wood fell. Inter IKEA CEO Jon Abrahamsson Ring said more price reductions were planned for its 2025 financial year, which started on Sept. 1, but likely not as significant.

The changes included replacing CFO Natalie Knight with China COO Doug Ostermann. The company said the changes were made to \"redouble\" its focus on key priorities and address global challenges facing the industry.  Stellantis (STLA) shares lost ground in early trading Friday after the \"Big Three\" automaker announced an executive shakeup as it tries to recover from a sales slump. The parent of the Jeep, Chrysler, and other brands said CFO Natalie Knight is leaving the company, and will be replaced by the firm’s China COO Doug Ostermann. Alfa Romeo brand CEO Jean-Philippe Imparato will also become CEO of the Enlarged Europe division, succeeding Uwe Hochgeschurtz, who is also departing. Antonio Filosa, head of South American operations, will be North America COO, succeeding Carlos Zarlenga, “whose next position will be subject to a further announcement.” Other changes included appointing Gregoire Olivier COO in China and Santo Ficili as CEO of Maserati and Alfa Romeo. Stellantis said the moves were designed “to redouble the Company’s focus on its key business priorities and confront head-on the global challenges facing the industry.” CEO Carlos Tavares called this a “Darwinian period for the automotive industry,” and said the new management team is expected to help “tackle the challenges ahead.” Stellantis has been reeling from a slowing car market, excess inventory, and Chinese competition. Last month, the automaker cut its outlook. Last week, it posted a significant drop in U.S. sales. Barclays downgraded the stock following the news, warning it sees no real recovery for Stellantis until at least the first half of next year. Shares of Stellantis were down about 3% in early trading Friday and have lost more than 40% of their value since the start of the year. TradingView Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "In this piece, I evaluated two electric vehicle stocks: BYD (BYDDY) (BYDDF) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN). A closer look suggests a bearish view for BYD and a neutral view for Rivian. China-based BYD is known for producing vehicles like the budget-friendly Atto 3 electric SUV, the Dolphin electric hatchback, and the Seal battery-electric mid-size sedan, among other vehicles. In addition to cars, BYD is also active in various industries, including the production of rechargeable batteries and mobile handset components. Meanwhile, Rivian is known for the R1S electric SEUV, the R1T electric pickup truck, and its electric delivery van, the EDV. American Depository Receipt (ADR) shares of BYD have surged 23% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date return to 38% and their one-year gain to 25%. Importantly, each ADR share of BYD traded over the counter in the U.S. is worth two H shares traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In contrast, Rivian Automotive stock has plummeted 36% over the last three months, dragging its year-to-date plunge down to 55%. The stock is off 47% over the past year. The market’s opposite reactions to these two stocks may have some investors wondering if Rivian offers a buy-the-dip opportunity. However, there’s more to both stocks than it appears. Let’s take a look. BYD is strongly tied to the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets right now. As such, this stock could continue to encounter significant volatility in light of what’s happening in those stock markets. Thus, a bearish view looks appropriate. First, an understanding of BYD’s business is helpful. As already stated, the company doesn’t just sell EVs, so there is much more to consider with the Chinese automaker. Additionally, BYD offers exposure to both battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids, which is critical right now as most of the growth in the clean-energy vehicle space is in hybrids rather than BEVs. Turning to the current issues with Chinese stocks, China’s stock market has gone through significant ups and downs recently. The latest news is that China’s central bank revealed a US$70 billion financing facility to fund institutional buying, which sent the Hang Seng Index up 3% at the market close on Oct. 10. Despite some recovery, the index remains down 6.5% for the week ending Oct. 10, following an earlier drop. All eyes are now on the weekend as investors hope for even more stimulus from the People’s Bank of China. If the central bank falls short, Chinese stocks could tumble further. Conversely, if more stimulus is introduced, they could rally, potentially driving BYD’s stock higher, pushing it beyond an attractive buy price.               ",

The company garnered negative coverage in July when a flawed software update caused worldwide tech outages, but RBC said CrowdStrike is successfully moving past the incident. Delta Air Lines said it continues to seek compensation from CrowdStrike related to the incident.  Shares of cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) added more than 5% on Thursday, notching the S&P 500's top performance of the day, after RBC Capital named the company one of its top investment ideas in North American software for 2025. CrowdStrike drew scrutiny in mid-July when the firm's defective software update caused widespread technology outages across the world. Fallout from that incident sent CrowdStrike shares tumbling, and it's still below the levels seen after those events—but the stock has been on a path of recovery since printing a low in early August. According to analysts at RBC, the negative headlines about the midsummer software update and subsequent technological interruptions generated \"short-term noise\" surrounding CrowdStrike stock, but the company appears poised to emerge from the situation in a strong position. RBC believes CrowdStrike could be on track to achieve $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company's management team recently reiterated its goal to achieve this ambitious milestone by fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike's ARR for fiscal 2024 came in at over $3.4 billion. CrowdStrike continues to face issues stemming from the July incident. When Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported lower-than-expected sales and profits in its quarterly report released Thursday, the carrier cited the negative impact of the CrowdStrike outage, which resulted in the cancellation of thousands of flights. According to Delta, the incident caused a $380 million hit to revenue in the quarter. The airline's CEO said Delta continues to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft (MSFT) related to the outages. Following Thursday's gains, CrowdStrike shares are trading around 23% higher year-to-date but remain around 21% below the all-time highs seen this summer before the incident.

Shares of Truth Social's parent company jumped Thursday, rising as the company announced some product news that helped the stock touch its highest level in months. Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) stock recently was up more than 16% to around $24. The move comes as the shares have risen off lows below $12 per share touched last month. Today's move likely was spurred in part by the company's announcement that a new app for watching its streaming video offering is now available in Google's Play Store. But the stock generally has risen in recent weeks, moving off lows driven by investor questions about whether the expiration of lock-up agreements governing some investors' trades would be followed by widespread selling by former President Donald Trump, its majority owner, or other big investors. That, for the most part, hasn't happened. That extended a run of volatility that has lasted nearly as long as the stock, which hit the public markets earlier this year via a merger with a blank-check company, has been publicly traded. The shares—which trade in part on investors' read on whether Trump might be re-elected—are still well off 2024 highs near $80, though now back at levels last seen in August.

Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are among the banks that have raised price targets in recent weeks. Nvidia stock is trading at record highs, but that's not deterring top Wall Street analysts from being bullish. Bank analysts have been hiking their price targets for the chip titan in recent weeks, predicting more upside even as the stock has seen a meteoric rise over the past year. Shares traded above $142 each on Monday, hitting a fresh record as investors gear up for the company's next earnings report on November 20. The stock is up 193% year-to-date. But Nvidia still has plenty of room to climb, according to forecasters. They point to signs of frenzied demand for the company's AI-enabling GPU chips and a long list of partnerships with enterprise \"hyperscalers.\" Here's what some of Wall Street's top forecasters are saying about their bullish outlook for the stock. BofA strategists raised their price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165 per share last week, implying another 35% upside from the stock's current levels. The upside will be driven by Nvidia's competitive advantage over other chipmakers, as well as the \"generational opportunity\" in the AI market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion, analysts said in a note. \"Driven by our increased NVDA Data Center Compute outlook, we now see the AI accelerator market growing to $280bn by CY27E (and over time toward $400bn+) from just ~$45bn in CY23. AI models (demand) continue to evolve,\" the bank added. Strategists pointed to positive signs for Nvidia's future chip demand, including commentary from other tech firms and comments from CEO Jensen Huang, who described the demand for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip as \"insane.\" Nvidia, meanwhile, also has a number of \"underappreciated\" business partnerships with firms like Accenture and Microsoft, which should contribute to the upside potential. \"We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice,\" the bank said. \"NVDA's engagements span multiple verticals (e.g., Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft), and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side.\"            "

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, reported a 3% fall in quarterly sales last week, undershooting estimates in its first decline in quarterly sales since the pandemic as demand in China and Japan weakened. Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo also reported a fall in quarterly revenue, hit by a slowdown in demand from China. \"The elephant in the room is that, in China, as long as price gaps (between China and other countries) exist, there is the opportunity for price sensitive consumers to go to the grey market,\" said Max Piero, CEO of luxury intelligence consultancy Re-Hub, which tracks grey market luxury purchases in China. That market, estimated to be worth $57 billion a year, has been fuelled in recent years by the rise of platforms such as DeWu, where luxury products, often sourced overseas, are sold at discounts from 20% to over 50% to prices at Chinese flagship stores. Re-Hub estimates that sales across 48 brands on DeWu rose 19% year on year in the second quarter to more than 7 billion yuan ($984.4 million). China's retail sales, a gauge of consumption, grew a subdued 3.2% in September and the weakness is a bad sign for global luxury giants as China accounts for around 25% of worldwide revenues for the sector. Growing consumer interest in both the second-hand and grey markets is adding a headache to top-end brands seeking to defend their sales in China. \"The rising prices of those luxury brands is definitely one of the reasons that more and more consumers are turning to the secondary market,\" said Yi Kejie, a 28-year-old marketing content manager and luxury consumer. SECOND-HAND OVER-SUPPLY Following the release of their third quarter sales, executives of LVMH, home to Louis Vuitton and Dior, defended their labels’ upmarket push and said they did not plan to introduce new ranges of more affordable products. They also said they had no intention of getting involved in the second-hand market, noting that the tight control their brands hold on distribution makes them less exposed to parallel markets. But China's second-hand market is also fuelled by the country's slowing economy, as more people are looking to make some cash off their luxury collections. \"The number of sellers is growing really fast, and the majority of them are selling luxury items for the first time. But for the buyer's side, it's pretty steady,\" said Zhu Tainiqi, founder of second-hand luxury goods marketplace ZZER.        "

        "body": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock closed at a record high on Monday as Wall Street analysts held firm on their bullish positions on the stock ahead of its earnings report in November. Shares of the leading AI chipmaker rose over 4% to close at $143.71 per share. The move comes as Wall Street analysts reiterate their Buy ratings on the stock. Citing strong demand for artificial intelligence, Bank of America (BAC) on Friday raised its price target from $165 to $190 (go inside the call with analyst Vivek Arya below from the Opening Bid podcast), while investment research firm CFRA raised its price target for Nvidia last week from $139 to $160. Overall, analysts see shares rising to $148.37 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. In addition to growth in the AI market at large, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said Nvidia’s strength in the enterprise AI space — i.e., its partnerships with companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Accenture (ACN) — is another factor contributing to his higher price target. Arya said “NVDA is the partner of choice” for enterprise AI hardware and software. Wedbush analyst and Nvidia bull Dan Ives echoed that sentiment in a note to investors Sunday, writing that there is “a tidal wave of enterprise spending as AI use cases explode,” with Nvidia leading the market. Ives forecasts the AI infrastructure market to grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies spending $1 trillion on AI capital expenditures in that time frame. “In a nutshell, we believe the stage is set for tech stocks to see another 20% move higher in 2025 with this tech bull market just hitting its next phase led by the AI Revolution,” Ives added. “In our opinion as the Fed and Powell have kicked off its aggressive rate cutting cycle, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector.” Despite a short-lived tumble last week and looming fears of an AI spending slowdown, Nvidia shares have risen nearly 3% over the past week and more than 20% in the last month. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said there is “insane” demand for its AI chips, which are used in data centers by Big Tech companies to power generative artificial intelligence software. Recent positive news from the company's industry partners has also boosted AI stocks across the board, including Nvidia. Micron (MU), which supplies memory chips used in Nvidia’s GPUs, and TSMC (TSM), which manufactures Nvidia’s AI chips, both surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in their recent earnings reports.

        "created_at": "21/10/2024",
        "body": "It seems likely that a small group of traders (or possibly a lone individual) have pushed up former President Donald Trump’s odds on Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market, by heavily betting on the Republican nominee. There has been a good deal of handwringing about this, both from supporters of vice president and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on X (formerly Twitter) who have an obvious incentive to call the markets manipulated, and from the mainstream press. “[T]he surge might be a mirage manufactured by a group of four Polymarket accounts that have collectively pumped about $30 million of crypto into bets that Trump will win,” The Wall Street Journal speculated. Indeed, there may be a lone bettor who has gone very long on Trump. But that's not necessarily evidence of something sinister. Aubrey Strobel is a communications partner at Bitcoin app developer Trust Machines and the host of The Aubservation podcast. First, the obvious point: it’s not just Polymarket where Trump is rallying. Trump \"yes\" shares are trading at around 59.9 cents on Polymarket right now, indicating the market sees a 59.9% probability he will win. (Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.) Predictit – a U.S. platform with strict betting limits (which would in theory be immune to the Polymarket whale) – has Trump at 56%. Kalshi, a U.S.-based, regulated platform, has Trump at 58%. If you think this price action constitutes “manipulation,” you would have to wonder why Kalshi – a platform where manipulation would be reportable – is trading in line with Polymarket. The online bookies also have Trump ahead: 59% at BetOnline, 55% at Betfair, and 60% at Bovada to name a few. And Trump is also trending up in the poll aggregates, so it’s not inconceivable that his true odds of winning are also increasing. Trump’s rally in the prediction markets coincides with Harris’ rough Fox News interview and new polls show Trump trudging upward. Secondly, the fact that a single anonymous entity has made large bets is not by itself evidence of “manipulation,” as many Harris supporters are claiming. Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine flatly says: “this does not look like market manipulation: Fredi9999 is not buying sloppily with the effect of pushing up the price, but rather buying carefully, in a manner that seems designed to get him a lot of Trump contracts for his money.” The simplest possible explanation is that a trader simply thinks Trump is underpriced and is willing to bet heavily on it. The mere existence of a large buyer does not imply manipulation. The entire premise of markets is that prices compress available information by rewarding those who take risk to express their views. The identity of the traders or the distribution of trades is irrelevant; in theory, everyone has a motive to extract information from markets by betting when their belief about the fair value of an asset diverges from the market’s value. Markets don’t need to be democratic in order to be reliable. They just need the most informed participants to financially express a view. Individual traders having concentrated ownership of an asset doesn’t in any way delegitimize the price. No one questions the price of Apple stock because Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a lot of it.          "

Netflix shares surged after the streaming giant reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales, profits, and subscriber numbers. Shares of grain processors Bunge and Archer-Daniels-Midland lost ground after an analyst said low crop prices and weak farmer sentiment weighed on the agriculture industry.  Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher on the final day of a trading week that included a series of earnings reports from key companies. After major financial firms disclosed mostly upbeat results earlier in the week, Netflix (NFLX) took the spotlight with a strong report that could be a positive signal for the tech and communications giants set to report in the coming weeks. On Friday, the S&P 500 added 0.4% to notch an all-time closing high. The Dow reversed morning losses to end the session nearly 0.1% higher, extending its streak of record closes to three. The Nasdaq was up 0.6%. Netflix shares scored the S&P 500's top daily performance, soaring 11.1% to an all-time high following the video-streaming giant's better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. Although the pace of subscriber additions slowed from the preceding quarters, 14% growth in total active subscribers was enough to edge out estimates. Analysts have indicated that the company's crackdown on password-sharing has helped boost subscriber numbers, but Netflix plans to discontinue the public release of subscriber data starting in 2025. Shares of Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) surged 10.2% after a securities filing confirmed reports that activist investor Jana Partners has acquired a stake of around 5% in the food processing company. Jana reportedly intends to encourage the maker of frozen french fries to consider the possibility of a sale as well as push for changes to its operations and capital allocation strategy.   An upbeat earnings report also helped lift shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which jumped 10% after the provider of robotic-assisted systems for minimally invasive medical procedures topped quarterly sales and profit estimates. The company disclosed an 18% uptick in the number of procedures performed using its da Vinci surgical system. In the wake of the strong results, analysts at Piper Sandler lifted their price target on Intuitive Surgical stock to $538 from $495. Agricultural stocks moved lower after Raymond James downgraded Canada-based grain processor Ag Growth International (AGGZF) to \"market perform.\" Analysts said soft crop prices and weak sentiment among farmers amounted to significant headwinds for the global agricultural industry. Shares of fellow grain handler Bunge Global (BG) dropped 6.3%, the steepest decline in the S&P 500 Friday, while peer Archer-Daniels-Midland's (ADM) shares slide 3.8%. Ag Growth International's American depositary receipts (ADRs) were down 10.7%.    ",

        "body": "Goldman Sachs forecast the S&P 500 would see annualized returns of 3% over the next 10 years. That would be down from the 13% annualized figure from the prior decade. The firm cited valuations, extreme market concentration, and more-regular economic contractions. The stock market's decadelong golden age will soon be a thing of the past, Goldman Sachs said. A new report from the firm's portfolio-strategy research team forecast that the S&P 500 would see an annualized nominal return of 3% over the next 10 years. That would put it in the 7th percentile of performance since 1930. It would also badly lag the 13% annualized figure put up by the benchmark index over the prior decade, Goldman data showed. \"Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are towards the lower end of their typical performance distribution relative to bonds and inflation,\" the analysts wrote. As an extension of this forecast, Goldman also sees stocks struggling to outperform other assets over the next 10 years. By its calculation, the S&P 500 has about a 72% chance of trailing bonds and a 33% probability of lagging inflation through 2034. Five factors underline Goldman's lackluster outlook: First, a historically stretched stock-market valuation implies lower future returns, the bank said. Current valuations are indeed elevated, with the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio at 38 times, or in the 97th percentile. The S&P 500's CAPE ratio has averaged 22%, Goldman said. Second, market concentration is near its highest level in 100 years, Goldman said. \"When equity market concentration is high, performance of the aggregate index is strongly dictated by the prospects of a few stocks,\" the analysts wrote. These stocks include tech large caps such as Nvidia and Alphabet, whose performance has driven the S&P 500 more than 20% higher year to date. While that's led the index through a string of record highs this year, it fosters a market mired in volatility risk and in need of diversity. \"Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time. The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index,\" Goldman said. While some may find reason to argue why tech stocks will maintain growth momentum, history suggests that revenue will slow. Goldman said that S&P 500 firms that had consistently generated over 20% revenue growth underwent a sharp drop off after 10 years.      "

        "body": "The Victorian Government of Australia has announced a significant stamp duty concession for off-the-plan property purchases, with an aim to construct more houses in the state of Victoria. The new change will reduce upfront costs, accelerate building projects, and enhance affordability across the board. Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan unveiled the one-year stimulus at a new apartment complex in North Fitzroy. Under the current system, first-home buyers and owner-occupiers are entitled to a stamp duty concession for off-the-plan purchases, with construction costs deductible from the sale price for tax calculations. However, the benefit is capped at a post-deduction value of A$750,000 ($501,157) for first-home buyers and A$550,000 for owner-occupiers. The new policy, designed to spur housing construction, extends the concession to all buyers of apartments, units, or townhouses off-the-plan, eliminating the previous value thresholds. Effective yesterday (21 October) for a duration of 12 months, it permits a full deduction of remaining construction and refurbishment costs when assessing stamp duty liabilities. The savings potential varies with the construction stage, but typically, an off-the-plan apartment buyer could pay roughly one-fourth of the stamp duty compared to without the latest concession. Meanwhile, a Victorian purchasing a A$620,000 apartment before construction could see stamp duty costs plummet from approximately A$32,000 to roughly A$4,000, saving nearly A$28,000. Allan said: “More apartments and townhouses getting built means more homes for young people and families to rent or buy.\" Victoria's treasurer Tim Pallas added: “This will significantly reduce upfront costs - it’s a huge win for all buyers and builders.” To qualify, the property must be part of a strata subdivision, which includes shared areas such as driveways or hallways. Non-strata properties such as house and land packages remain ineligible for the new concession, though existing concessions for first-home buyers and owner-occupiers still apply. This initiative responds to industry concerns regarding the impact of current interest rates on sales and project launches. By reducing upfront costs for a broader buyer demographic, developers can anticipate increased presale activity, fulfilling financing prerequisites more swiftly and kick-starting construction sooner. The concession complements other government efforts, including the construction of new social and affordable homes and the Suburban Rail Loop with its housing precincts. \"Victorian Government announces stamp duty cuts to boost housing market\" was originally created and published by World Construction Network, a GlobalData owned brand.

This year’s Atlantic hurricane season has spun out fewer storms than 2023, but the toll from five that made landfall in the US will go down as some of the most destructive in recent memory. Orange juice futures are lingering at elevated levels.

Oil Forecasts for oil consumption next year from three main forecasting groups have taken a bearish turn since July, largely driven by weakness in China. Those pared down projections have added a layer of gloom over the market that helped overshadow the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East. The International Energy Agency continued the trend last week, cutting its forecast further, with its estimate of a persistent glut next year contributing to crude’s sizable decline for the week. Oil gained Monday amid tensions in the Middle East. Hurricanes This year’s Atlantic hurricane season has logged 15 named storms so far, thanks to the appearance of Nadine and Oscar on the weekend. That’s approaching an average year, though the numbers can be deceiving: With five hurricane strikes on mainland US — including Helene and Milton that hit two weeks apart and devastated swaths of the South — may leave 2024 as one of the costliest storm seasons. The true scope of damages could take months to fully evaluate, but for context Katrina in 2005 caused $200 billion in inflation-adjusted damages and Harvey in 2017 racked up $160 billion in costs. Orange Juice Orange juice prices are up about 50% this year as drought and disease undermine output from Brazil, the world’s biggest supplier of the juice, while Florida’s citrus groves continue to dwindle. Futures reached fresh records last month, and Hurricane Milton has underpinned higher prices after the storm felled fruits and trees in the top juice-producing US state. The US Department of Agriculture had already expected Florida’s production this season to be the lowest since 1933 — but adding Milton’s impact could deal an even bigger blow to the harvest. Futures extended declines on Monday. Iron Ore The world’s two biggest suppliers of iron ore, Rio Tinto Group and Vale SA, boosted output of the steelmaking ingredient in the third quarter, even as demand from China faces headwinds due to the nation’s unresolved property crisis. Rio’s quarterly output has climbed from earlier this year, while Brazil’s Vale churned out its highest volume since late 2018, ahead of a dam-collapse disaster that triggered yearslong disruptions. The world’s top iron ore miners continue to beef up supplies, with their large-scale operations safeguarded by per-ton costs that remain far below current spot levels.            "

U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday to cap off their sixth winning week in a row, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying to new records. For the week, the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.9%, the blue-chip Dow climbed 1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be an eventful one as investors assess the outlook for the economy, inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings. Most important on the economic calendar will be Thursday morning's release of initial jobless claims figures at 8:30AM ET, as well as a pair of flash PMI surveys. That will be accompanied by a heavy slate of Fed speakers, with the likes of district governors Neel Kashkari, Lorie Logan, Mary Daly, and Patrick Harker all set to make public appearances during the week. Source: Investing.com Some 88% of market participants expect the Federal Open Market Committee to cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at its November 7 policy meeting, while nearly 12% expect no change, according to Investing.com’s Fed Monitor Tool. Meanwhile, third-quarter earnings season shifts into high gear, with reports expected from several high-profile companies, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Some of the other notable reporters include United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), General Motors (NYSE:GM), AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, October 21 - Friday, October 25. I foresee a strong performance for GE Aerospace stock this week, with a potential breakout to a fresh multi-year high on the horizon. The primary catalyst for GE Aerospace is its third-quarter earnings report, set to be released before the market opens on Tuesday at 6:30AM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in GE stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 5.3% in either direction.

Despite experiencing some volatility in late summer, the NASDAQ index has climbed 24% year-to-date and remains on a generally upward trajectory. While industry giants like Nvidia have dominated headlines, Berenberg analyst Nay Soe Naing is turning attention toward under-the-radar names in the chip software space. To delve deeper, we’ve leveraged the TipRanks data platform to gauge Wall Street’s sentiment on two such stocks recommended by Naing. Both come with Buy ratings and promising upside potential. Let’s dive into the details, along with key insights from the Berenberg analysis. Synopsys (SNPS) The first company we’ll look at here, Synopsys, is a specialist in electronic design automation, with a focus on silicon design, the important first step in the manufacturing process for silicon semiconductor chips. The company offers solutions for silicon design and verification, silicon intellectual property, and systems verification and validation, and bases its solutions on artificial intelligence (AI) and software-defined systems. Synopsys boasts that its technology, and the tech and software solutions that it provides, make possible the innovations behind many of today’s big headline generators – autonomous vehicles, machine learnings, and high-speed communications, among others. In recent weeks, Synopsys has made announcements showing that it is both expanding and streamlining its business. On the streamlining side, the company sold off its optical solutions group to Keystone Technologies, a leader in the field of design and emulation test solutions. The terms of this deal were not disclosed. And on the expansion side, Synopsys at the end of September entered into an agreement with TSMC, the world’s second-largest chip maker by market cap and third-largest by revenue, to provide advanced EDA and IP solutions to support TSMC’s most advanced technological process and manufacturing lines. Synopsys may not be a household name, but it is big business. The company has more than 35 years’ experience, and employs over 19,000 people – and brought in over $5.8 billion in revenue for calendar-year 2023. In its most recently reported quarter, for fiscal 3Q24, the company brought in $1.526 billion at the top line, for a 13%-plus year-over-year gain and beating the forecast by $10 million. The company’s bottom line, by non-GAAP measures, came to $3.43 per share, growing 27% year-over-year and beating expectations by 14 cents per share. Synopsys followed these sound results by guiding toward 15% y/y revenue growth for fiscal 2024; achieving that would be a company record.                ",

The CIO said the market has suffered from \"invincibility syndrome.\" Grant said stocks could soon enter a period of weak returns, possibly for \"many years.\" The bull market in stocks looks like it's close to the top, according to an investment chief. Michael Grant, the co-CIO of Calamos Investments, thinks large-cap stocks could be on track for one of the best years over the last century, before the market tips into a period defined by subpar returns. That's because stocks are flashing signs of \"invincibility syndrome,\" with investors falsely believing that nothing can stop further gains, he said in a note this week. \"The most significant feature of this investment year is the perception that US equities are virtually invincible. This 'Invincibility Syndrome' historically signals a crescendo when markets are in the process of summiting a major peak,\" Grant wrote. \"In our view, the paradox of this rewarding year is its underlying warning of low future returns for 2025 and beyond,\" he later added. The precarious state of the market can be seen in a slew of data points that measure valuation, sentiment, and positioning, he noted. A handful of valuation measures suggest stocks are at historically expensive levels, Grant said. For instance, the median price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is 28, the most expensive stocks have been relative to earnings since around the dot-com bubble. Meanwhile, the standard Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio — which smooths out outlier P/E data — has climbed past 35, the highest level on record. Sentiment and position indicators are also flashing signs investors are overexcited about the stock market, Grant said. Households appear to be the most bullish on stocks since the dot-com era. The percentage of consumers who expect stock gains over the next year has climbed to its highest levels recorded since 1987, according to the three-month moving average of responses to the Conference Board's monthly survey. Households also have a lot of cash allocated to investments. US households held a record $42.43 trillion in corporate equities and mutual fund shares over the second quarter, Federal Reserve data shows. Meanwhile, the amount of cash held by non-bank investors as a percentage of equity mutual funds has dropped to nearly 30%, around historic lows. That suggests there's little \"cushion\" in the event the stock market declines or experiences a shock, Grant said.       "

Analysts at Bradesco BBI saw similar gains. Bank of America favored Brazil over Mexico amid estimates for slowing US growth, while Banco Itau BBA forecast a banner year on the back of attractive valuations and earnings growth. Instead, Brazilian equities have been among the world’s worst performers, sending one valuation measure to the lowest among major stock indexes and near the lowest relative to the emerging-market benchmark in more than a decade. They’re trailing far behind most peers, beaten down by a government that’s blown out the budget deficit and forced policymakers into a hawkish stance to contain inflation expectations. Higher interest rates — the 10.75% benchmark is more than double the Fed’s target — are pushing investors away from stocks and into government bonds that promise double-digit returns with little risk. “Higher interest rates in Brazil are going to keep local investors on the sidelines,” said Josh Rubin, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “There’s no reason to go buy equities.” The Ibovespa has lost 2.8% this year, among the 10 worst performances in the world, but the losses are even bigger in dollar terms: a whopping 17% plunge. That’s even as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 15% when factoring in dividends and the S&P 500 Index returned 24%. The market dynamic is set to continue, with traders betting on at least 2 percentage points of additional rate hikes in Brazil this year even as they predict the Fed will cut at least half a point. Brazil is one of the only major central banks in the world in the midst of a hiking cycle; the vast majority of its global counterparts are reducing borrowing costs. Brazil analysts raised their 2025 year-end interest rate forecasts for the second straight week, according to a weekly central bank survey published Monday. “Stocks are very cheap and it’s been like this for a long time,” said Nikolaj Lippmann, Morgan Stanley’s chief Latin American equity strategist. “It’s probably going to remain like this until we find a way to get interest rates down.”                    "

The Internet and the exploding amount of data have transformed how businesses interact with, market to, and transact with their customers. Personalization of offerings, e-commerce, targeted advertising and data-empowered sales teams are now table stakes for modern businesses, and sales and marketing software providers are becoming the tools of evolving customer interaction. The 23 sales and marketing software stocks we track reported a strong Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Thankfully, sales and marketing software stocks have been resilient with share prices up 8.7% on average since the latest earnings results. Founder Jack McDonald’s second software rollup, Upland Software (NASDAQ:UPLD) is a one stop shop for sales and marketing software, project management, HR, and contact center services for small and medium sized businesses. Upland reported revenues of $69.34 million, down 6.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.3%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a mixed quarter with revenue guidance for the next quarter falling below analysts' expectations. \"In Q2, we beat our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoints and posted Core Bookings in excess of Core Churn for the second quarter in a row,\" said Jack McDonald, Upland's chairman and chief executive officer. Upland delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 4.1% since reporting and currently trades at $2.40. Is now the time to buy Upland?

A $30 million bet on Trump has raised questions about how big bettors can swing the odds. With the presidential election less than three weeks away, polls indicate former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a virtual dead heat. But the election odds look somewhat different in the prediction markets, where people can bet money on the outcome of a race, and the constantly changing odds of a Harris or Trump win on these marketplaces are being closely watched by politicos. Since the start of October, there's been a notable divergence between the betting markets and the polls. Despite numerous polling averages showing a close race between Harris and Trump, with all major battleground states within the margin of error, the betting markets have moved decisively for Trump. Rumblings have grown that a single person or a consortium of people could be tipping the scale for Trump on the betting platform Polymarket, with a series of big bets totaling $30 million, in a bid to boost the narrative that he's a shoo-in for president. Here's what you need to know. Polymarket is a crypto-based predictions market that has become one of the most popular venues for placing online bets on upcoming elections. It was founded in 2020 and requires users to place bets via stablecoins. Stablecoins are crypto tokens pegged to a fiat currency like the dollar and rarely deviate from their value. Polymarket allows investors to bet on yes or no questions. For example: Will Donald Trump win the 2024 US presidential election? Polymarket also allows its users to \"trade\" its bets, or sell out early for profits or to cut their losses. This year, Polymarket has seen $1.75 billion worth of trading volume, according to data from The Block, with betting activity exploding on US election outcomes. In October alone, the betting market has seen $1.24 billion in trading volume. Before 2024, Polymarket's monthly trading volume rarely topped $10 million. Polymarket investors include the early Facebook backer Peter Thiel, ethereum's cofounder Vitalik Buterin, and Airbnb's cofounder Joe Gebbia. The company has raised a total of $74 million, according to data from Crunchbase. Trump has a massive lead over Harris in the betting markets. As of 11:55 a.m. on Friday, Polymarket odds showed Trump had a 60.1% chance of becoming the 47th president, compared with just 39.8% for Harris.                  "

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8%, shedding over 300 points. The Nasdaq Composite, however, rose 0.2%, fueled by Nvidia's 4% surge to an all-time high. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.18%, the highest level since July, putting pressure on rate-sensitive stocks, particularly in real estate and utilities.

Investor uncertainty surrounding U.S. earnings reports, along with rising Treasury yields, contributed to the broader European decline as markets continued to react to Wall Street's performance.

Technology has been a double-edged sword in real estate services. On the one hand, internet listings are effective at disseminating information far and wide, casting a wide net for buyers and sellers to increase the chances of transactions. On the other hand, digitization in the real estate market could potentially disintermediate key players like agents who use information asymmetries to their advantage. The 14 real estate services stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 13.1% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Luckily, real estate services stocks have performed well with share prices up 13.8% on average since the latest earnings results. Founded by Expedia co-founders Lloyd Frink and Rich Barton, Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) is the leading U.S. online real estate marketplace. Zillow reported revenues of $572 million, up 13% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 6.3%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin and earnings estimates.

        "body": "According to GlobalData's ‘Apparel Country Snapshot: Türkiye’ report, the value and luxury segment are both set to outperform the Turkish apparel market from 2023 to 2028. Value's share is forecast to rise by 7.1ppts to 31.6%, with a CAGR of 34.6%, driven by consumers seeking affordable options from players such as fast fashion giant Shein and sports and athleisure wear brand Decathlon amid economic pressures. However, the luxury segment is also expected to see its share rise from 5.2% to 6%, at a CAGR of 31.4%, as luxury shoppers remain relatively immune to financial pressures. The report explained that this market polarisation is projected to cause the premium and mass market segments to lose share. Premium's share is forecast to decline a significant 6.9ppts to 16.4% between 2023 and 2028, with a CAGR of 19.3%, reflecting consumers' shit towards either more affordable or more exclusive offerings. Meanwhile, the mass market will see its share slightly decline by 1.1ppts to 46% by 2028, with its CAGR standing at 27.3%, however, it will remain the \"largest\" segment due to the board appeal of these players. The report further revealed that in 2023, the sportswear market rose by 59.6% to reach ₺133.6bn ($3.90bn), marginally underperforming the growth of the wider apparel industry. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30.0% from 2023 to 2028, increasing its share of the total apparel market by 1.4ppts to 17.5%, fueled by a rising interest in fitness and the ongoing popularity of casual, versatile fashion. GlobalData pointed out that global brands like Nike and Adidas are driving this with their strong market presence and targeted marketing strategies, while local players such as Lescon are also gaining traction. On the other hand, resale apparel in Türkiye experienced a robust CAGR of 62.1% between 2018 and 2023, driven by consumers' growing interest in sustainability and affordability. Although GlobalData believes the market has slowed as it has become more developed, it continues to show strong growth, with a projected CAGR of 31.2% from 2023 to 2027. This surge is said to be largely fueled by online platforms, with major players like Dolap, Vestiaire Collective and Letgo gaining share, as consumers increasingly turn to them due to their wide accessibility Another report by GlobalData published recently, unveiled that footwear is set to drive market growth in Türkiye from 2023 to 2028, fuelled by growing demand for a wider range of styles. \"In data: Value, luxury, sportswear set to drive Turkish apparel market\" was originally created and published by Just Style, a GlobalData owned brand.

Revenue beat Bloomberg consensus estimates of $9.78 billion to hit $9.83 billion in Q3, Netflix reported after the market close on Thursday, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. The growth came as the streamer continued to lean on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to last year's price hikes on certain subscription plans. Netflix guided to fourth quarter revenue of $10.13 billion, a beat compared to consensus estimates of $10.01 billion. For full-year 2025, the company sees revenue hitting between $43 billion and $44 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $43.4 billion. This would represent growth of 11% to 13% from the company's expected 2024 revenue guidance of $38.9 billion. It expects full-year operating margins to hit 27%, an increase from the previous 26%, after the metric hit nearly 30% in the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) also beat estimates in the quarter, with the company reporting EPS of $5.40, above consensus expectations of $5.16 and well ahead of the $3.73 EPS figure it reported in the year-ago period. Netflix guided to fourth quarter EPS of $4.23, ahead of consensus calls for $3.90. Subscribers also came in strong with another 5 million-plus subscribers added on the heels of breakout programming like \"The Perfect Couple\" and \"Nobody Wants This.\" Subscriber additions of 5.07 million beat expectations of 4.5 million and follows the 8.05 million net additions the streamer added in the second quarter. The company had added 8.8 million paying users in Q3 2023. \"We expect paid net additions to be higher in Q4 than in Q3’24 due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate,\" the company said, citing upcoming releases like \"Squid Game\" Season 2, the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. Investors have praised the company's foray into sports and live events. Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction, accounting for over 50% of sign-ups in the countries where it's offered during the third quarter. \"We continue to build our advertising business and improve our offering for advertisers,\" the company said in the earnings release. \"Ads membership was up 35% quarter on quarter, and our ad tech platform is on track to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025.\"              ",

        "body": "Netflix shares powered higher into the close of Friday trading, notching their biggest single-day gain in a year, following a solid set of third quarter earnings and a host of Wall Street price target changes for streaming media giant. Netflix  (NFLX) , which along with Alphabet-owned  (GOOGL)  YouTube produces more streaming minutes than all their major competitors combined, is looking to grow its share of revenue from ad-supported tiers on its platform following its crackdown on password sharing last year. The move was designed to keep viewers from leaving to other platforms by offering cheaper alternatives to Netflix's ad-free offering and has enabled the group to continue adding paid subscribers while opening a new revenue stream from advertising markets worldwide. The pace of those subscriber gains is slowing, however, and Netflix has said that starting next year it will no longer publish details of the additions starting from next year. That leaves investors to focus on revenue growth in its ad-supported tiers and on profit margins tied to its broader platform sales and the money it spends on new content and technologies. Future Publishing/Getty Images That said, Netflix still added around 5.1 million new subscribers over the three months ended in October, a tally topped Wall Street's 4 million consensus forecast and included around 2.5 million people opting for the ad-free tier where it was available. The Los Gatos, Calif., group also beat Wall Street's profit forecast with a bottom line of $5.40 a share and posted stronger-than-expected third quarter revenues of $9.83 billion, a 15.1% increase from the same period last year. Adding to the bullish thesis, Netflix also said subscriber gains over the final three months of the year would grow even faster than they did over the third quarter, thanks in part to new live sports offerings and the return of the hit South Korea-made drama 'Squid Game.' \"We are in the subscription and entertainment business. And you can see in our results it's a pretty good business, and it appeals to a very large segment of consumers and fans,\" Co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on a conference call late Thursday. \"Our top 10 films that premier on Netflix all have over 100 million views, among the most-watched films in the world,\" he added. Related: Netflix hints at when subscriber rates may rise What the group didn't deliver, however, was a change in the pricing of either its ad-supported tier, which starts at $6.99 in the U.S, or its main ad-free platform, which costs $15.49 per month.

The Mexican peso weakened, extending its worst weekly plunge since August. The gains chipped away at an otherwise rough week for developing-world currencies. But strategists are warning the relief may be short-lived. A flurry of factors that propelled the greenback still loom, including the prospect of Donald Trump’s return to the White House, data that points to a resilient US economy and lackluster China stimulus measures. “There will likely be a broad aversion towards EM given Trump risks, but some currencies may enjoy offsetting factors that allow them to outperform” said Juan Manuel Herrera Betancourt, a strategist at Scotiabank in London. “Were optimism around Chinese stimulus to improve, we would likely see a boost from metals prices to the Peruvian sol and Chilean peso.” One-month implied volatility for emerging-market currencies rose for a fourth week, the longest streak since August. Citigroup strategists including Luis Costa said emerging currencies could become more vulnerable around the time of the election, particularly as rate cuts in many emerging markets have eroded their real yield cushion against developed-market peers. Latin American currencies, which had been some of investors’ favorite to pick up higher yields, were hit particularly hard this week. Even as prices of iron ore and copper recovered Friday following China’s central bank announcement, currencies from Brazil and Chile sank more than their peers. The Brazilian real traded at the lowest level in over two months versus the dollar as traders brush off government plans to contain fiscal spending. Chile’s peso, meantime, continued its free-fall, despite higher copper prices, after the central bank cut rates and signaled further reductions to come as the economy struggles to gain traction. The Mexican peso, meantime, sank 3.1% this week, the worst performance since August. It briefly weakened past the 20-per-dollar level Thursday, and ended the Friday session just shy of that at 19.88.               "

Analysts were predicting Netflix would add 4.52 million subscribers. The shares surged 11% to $763.89 on Friday in New York, the biggest gain in a year. The stock has more than quadrupled since May 2022, when a slowdown in the company’s growth led to a major selloff and spooked investors about the entertainment business. Since then, Netflix has added more than 60 million customers, thanks to a crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of a lower-priced subscription with advertising. The company finished the quarter with 282.7 million subscribers. “We’re feeling really good about the business,” Co-Chief Executive Officer Ted Sarandos said on a call with analysts. “We had a plan to re-accelerate growth and we delivered on that plan.” Most analysts believe the boost from the password crackdown is temporary, and that Netflix will soon need to find another way to grow. The company has yet to see material financial returns from its investment in advertising or video games, and some on Wall Street now worry the stock is overvalued. Subscriber growth “does seem like it’s slowing back down,” according to Dave Heger, an analyst with Edward Jones. Yet Netflix continues to deliver stronger growth than expected, and its leadership has sought to reassure investors by saying the company will benefit from the crackdown on password sharing in the years ahead. The company on Thursday predicted sales next year will increase between 11% to 13% — to as much as $44 billion — through a mix of new members and price increases. Netflix will increase prices in Spain and Italy on Friday, and said it will phase out one of its cheaper-priced plans in Brazil later this quarter. Two regions — Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the Asia-Pacific — accounted for almost all of the company’s new customers. Netflix lost customers in Latin America for the first time since early 2023. New subscribers in the current, fourth quarter will exceed the third-quarter total, the company also said.

        "body": "By Nora Eckert DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors continued to defy Wall Street's expectations this year, posting third-quarter results ahead of analyst projections on the back of steady gasoline-engine truck and SUV sales and a focus on keeping inventories lean. GM is targeting annual earnings at the top end of its previous forecast, and Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson brushed off economic concerns for customers. “The consumer has held up remarkably well for us,” he told reporters, adding that interest rate cuts would further improve demand next year. GM started the year expecting to make $12 billion to $14 billion in pretax profit and raised the forecast in midyear to $13 billion to $15 billion, buoyed by strong pricing and consumer spending. On Tuesday, it said it was on track to deliver between $14 billion and $15 billion in pretax profit. GM's adjusted earnings per share were $2.96 for the quarter, outpacing analysts’ forecast of $2.43 per share. Revenue for the three-month period was $48.8 billion, beating Wall Street’s expectation of $44.6 billion. CEO Mary Barra has been focusing on a message of stability, saying earlier this month that the automaker's profit next year is expected to look similar to this year, a relief for investors who are worried about a potential decline in the auto industry's earnings. GM has said pricing could be softer next year but it expects results to be supported by costs cuts on SUVs and EVs and improvement in China. A weak spot in otherwise strong earnings was China, where operations regressed from a powerhouse to a loss of $210 million in the first half of this year. GM lost another $137 million in the region during the third quarter, and it is planning a restructuring of operations there. \"We really haven't instituted any of the real restructuring yet,\" Jacobson said, adding that sales in the region are up and inventory down. Investor concerns persist that historically high interest rates and economic fears will catch up with consumers and dampen sales of new cars, despite the resilience seen for much of the year. Shareholders are also queasy about automakers’ EV losses as Chinese rivals pump out affordable electric vehicles abroad and Tesla continues to dominate battery-powered vehicle sales in the U.S. While Chinese automakers have not yet penetrated the U.S., large automakers like GM see a threat from low-cost and high-tech vehicles, executives have said. GM's stock is up 36% year-to-date, outpacing rivals Stellantis and Ford Motor, whose shares have both decreased over the same period. Ford has struggled with costly quality problems and Stellantis with decreasing sales and revenue in North America after it raised prices and held back on incentives.     "

But it's been swapped with a different bullish sentiment, one we all know very well: the strength of a hot economy, which has helped power the market all year — until that cut. While inflation and economic reacceleration concerns have returned after a string of hot data (the September jobs report, the Consumer Price Index, hot retail sales, and calmer weekly jobless claims), the strength has done nothing if not buoy the market. It has done just fine (thank you very much) under the past few years of high interest rates and endless no-landing comments. A hot economy is good for stocks. All this has kept the S&P 500 floating around its all-time high all week, now well over 5,800, as the index passes more and more year-end forecasts — and their subsequent upward revisions, like UBS's 5,850 figure that it published Tuesday. The mood feels different than a month ago. But as our Chart of the Week shows, not a whole lot has actually changed in terms of expectations — especially to the downside. The latest Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey shows the soft landing potential may have slightly decreased. But the hard landing respondents faded just as much, falling into the single digits for the first time since June, with just 8% seeing a recession in the next 12 months. Checking in with the CME's FedWatch tool also shows little change. The belief that the Fed will continue to cut interest rates in November is still overwhelming, with the tool showing a 91% chance of a 25 basis point cut on Friday. Reconciling these two things — another potentially reaccelerating economy and a rate cut the market is almost certain of — sounds tough. But it's not when you remember how high rates still are, as we wrote earlier this week in Chart of the Day. As Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said this week, rates are still \"overall restrictive.\" Jason Furman, the former Council of Economic Advisers Chairman under President Barack Obama, told Yahoo Finance that he sees inflation as a bigger problem than recession right now. But the current Harvard professor mused that while \"the Fed needs to have tight policy, it just doesn't need to have policy being as tight as it was last year.\"     "

The lawsuit is the latest salvo in a bitter ongoing battle between publishers and tech companies over how the latter may use copyrighted content without authorization to build and operate their AI systems. \"This suit is brought by news publishers who seek redress for Perplexity's brazen scheme to compete for readers while simultaneously freeriding on the valuable content the publishers produce,\" according to the lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York by Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones and the NY Post. Perplexity did not immediately respond to emails from Reuters seeking comment. The AI company is among the leading startups attempting to uproot the search engine market dominated by Alphabet’s Google. It assembles information from webpages it deems to be authoritative, then provides a summary directly within Perplexity’s own tool. Perplexity uses a variety of large language models (LLMs) to generate its summaries, from OpenAI to Meta's open-source model Llama. It provides citations in those results, though Perplexity's own marketing promotes the notion that its interface enables users to “skip the links.” Google likewise now shows AI-generated summaries similar to those offered by Perplexity, though most publishers grudgingly accept that arrangement because opting out would also mean having their content removed from Google's search results, which would render them virtually invisible online. The news publishers seek to differentiate Perplexity from search engines, which they argue allow for the discovery of their work, not a substitution for it, according to the lawsuit. In the suit, the News Corp-owned publishers say their journalists investigate and write stories under tight deadlines and unpredictable circumstances. There is high demand for high-quality news presented in a timely, digestible format, and these publications rely on the sale of advertising and subscriptions to underwrite the cost of journalism, they argue. The news organizations allege Perplexity’s AI-generated “answer machine” has ingested its copyrighted news stories, analysis and opinion in an internal database used to generate responses to users’ questions. In its quest to provide answers, Perplexity copied \"vast\" quantities of the publishers' work into a database, which uses an AI technique known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide answers to users' queries, the suit alleges.

Maersk said it had revised its outlook for global container market volume growth in 2024 to around 6% from a range of between 4% to 6% seen previously.

Attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Iran-aligned Houthi militants have disrupted a shipping route vital to east-west trade, with prolonged re-routing of shipments pushing freight rates higher and causing congestion in Asian and European ports. Maersk now expects full-year underlying EBITDA of between $11.0 billion and $11.5 billion, up from a previous range of $9 billion to $11 billion, the group said.

Netflix beat across every major financial metric in its third quarter results last week and projected sales for the current quarter that came in ahead of Wall Street's expectations. On Friday, the streaming giant notched a previous record close of just below $764. \"In our view, Netflix remains one of the best positioned companies within media and has several growth drivers,\" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note following the report, citing the company's booming advertising tier, along with its initiatives in gaming, sports, and live events. The analyst reiterated her Buy rating on shares and raised her price target to $800 from the prior $740. But with the stock up nearly 60% since the start of the year, its high valuation has caused some concerns. Investors have rewarded Netflix for diversifying its revenue streams, with its ad tier now accounting for over 50% of sign-ups in the countries where it's offered. The company's top-line growth has not only benefited from ads but also from the streamer's crackdown on password sharing, which analysts say is almost complete. The completion of the crackdown should lead to fewer subscribers compared to previous quarters, with future price hikes likely to offset the slowdown. \"Revenue growth in 2025 and beyond should continue to be a function of slower subscriber growth and a return to a more normal pricing cadence as the company has largely made its way through the [password-sharing crackdown],\" Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft said on Friday. Wall Street analysts have noted a price hike would be a positive catalyst for the stock in the near term, citing the company's pricing power relative to competitors. \"Given Netflix’s low cost per viewed hour, we see scope for the firm to raise US prices by 12% in 2025,\" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said in a note ahead of the report. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the company will continue to \"evolve\" the pricing of its tiers, but that it \"love[s] the low price point and increased accessibility that comes with our ad plan,\" which costs $6.99 in the US. Still, Netflix recently revealed year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices. \"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a note to clients following the report. \"Netflix’s stock is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last week, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% to 13% in 2025.

Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Volatility is elevated for options on stocks, bonds and currencies alike as investors pay up for protection. The risks are clear: a hotly contested US election, interest-rate decisions in the US and Europe, the threat of a wider Middle East conflict and quarterly earnings. In the stock market, implied volatility is outpacing actual swings, and puts protecting against a selloff are favored over bullish calls. “The buyside has been forced to over-hedge by risk management for a bunch of events occurring simultaneously,” Nomura cross-asset strategist Charlie McElligott said last week. “Investors everywhere are obsessing and fixated upon ‘Worst-Case Scenario’ left-tails.” Statistically, the market always performed well when said over-hedging occurs, with stocks on median up 13% a year later, he added. With the volatility shock from early August still fresh despite indexes reaching record highs, market players haven’t returned to the level of calm seen in the first half of the year, when hedging was shunned as a drag on performance. Trading has overall been muted, and some investors have even pulled back: Open interest in futures for the Nasdaq 100 Index sank by $5.7 billion notional value in one day last week. Yet if the market gets past the gauntlet of the November events with ripples rather than a tsunami, traders might find themselves with too much protection and too little exposure, leading to yet another episode of chasing a rally as it unfolds. The underperformance of hedged portfolios is already playing out: Since Aug. 5, the Invesco S&P 500 Downside Hedge ETF is down 1.1%, compared with a total return of 13% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. When the protection is unwound or just expires, dealers on the other side needing to adjust their trading books will add to the buying. While the Cboe Volatility Index and other measures of options costs remain elevated, one-month S&P 500 realized volatility has fallen by more than half since mid-August to near a three-month low. The lower readings, especially as the wild swings from early August drop out of the calculations, are poised to bring systematic investors back into the market, creating another tailwind. That group alone could buy some $160 billion in stocks over the next three months, according to Nomura estimates.               "

        "body": "Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang, two of tech’s wealthiest and most famous executives, saw their net worth grow this year by more than anyone else's on the planet. The net worth of Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, increased by $76.5 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Just behind Huang was Facebook cofounder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth rose by $76 billion in 2024. That is equal to or exceeds the entire market cap of some companies, such as fellow tech juggernaut Spotify and the spirits maker Diageo, which both have a market cap of $76 billion, as well as CVS ($73 billion), Target ($70 billion), and Capital One ($60 billion). Zuckerberg and Huang are now the third and 11th richest people in the world, respectively. Zuckerberg, who is behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder and executive chair Jeff Bezos on Bloomberg’s rich list, has a total net worth of $204 billion, while Huang is worth $121 billion. Both Zuckerberg and Huang benefited tremendously from the standout stock performance of the companies they helm. Since the start of the year, Nvidia’s share price has surged 192% and Meta’s went up 65%. Both Meta and Nvidia are part of the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap tech stocks that have powered much of the past year’s market rally. Investors have rewarded both companies for their solidified market positions—Meta in digital advertising and Nvidia in chip manufacturing—along with their AI-focused innovation pipelines and the steady leadership provided by their executives. The two executives control substantiation portions of their companies’ shares. Zuckerberg owns about 13.5% of Meta stock, amounting to about 345 million shares. Meanwhile, Huang owns between 3.5% to 4% of Nvidia, totalling about 861 million shares. Nvidia’s stock underwent a 10-to-one stock split in July. Earlier this year, Huang announced his intention to sell up to 6 million shares by the first quarter of 2025. To do so, Huang adopted a prearranged plan meant to avoid spooking investors and finished selling the 6 million shares in September, ahead of the 2025 date he had previously announced, according to regulatory filings.

        "body": "Wrapping up Q2 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the engineered components and systems stocks, including Park-Ohio (NASDAQ:PKOH) and its peers. Engineered components and systems companies possess technical know-how in sometimes narrow areas such as metal forming or intelligent robotics. Lately, automation and connected equipment collecting analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand. On the other hand, like the broader industrials sector, engineered components and systems companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies’ offerings. The 13 engineered components and systems stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.9% below. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Thankfully, engineered components and systems stocks have been resilient with share prices up 9.8% on average since the latest earnings results. Based in Cleveland, Park-Ohio (NASDAQ:PKOH) provides supply chain management services, capital equipment, and manufactured components. Park-Ohio reported revenues of $432.6 million, up 1.1% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with some shareholders anticipating a better outcome. “We are proud to have delivered record revenue results and improved profitability during the second quarter. We achieved these results against a stable but mixed revenue backdrop, with particular strength coming from our aerospace and defense market as well as benefiting from significant backlogs in some of our long cycle businesses. While we expect mixed demand in global industrial markets to continue, our diversification and improved cost structure will help us achieve year-over-year revenue growth with improved profitability and free cash flow through the business cycle,\" said Matthew V.

        "body": "The end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let’s take a look at how APi (NYSE:APG) and the rest of the construction and maintenance services stocks fared in Q2. Construction and maintenance services companies not only boast technical know-how in specialized areas but also may hold special licenses and permits. Those who work in more regulated areas can enjoy more predictable revenue streams - for example, fire escapes need to be inspected every five years–. More recently, services to address energy efficiency and labor availability are also creating incremental demand. But like the broader industrials sector, construction and maintenance services companies are at the whim of economic cycles as external factors like interest rates can greatly impact the new construction that drives incremental demand for these companies’ offerings. The 13 construction and maintenance services stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Luckily, construction and maintenance services stocks have performed well with share prices up 14.2% on average since the latest earnings results. Started in 1926 as an insulation contractor, APi (NYSE:APG) provides life safety solutions and specialty services for buildings and infrastructure. APi reported revenues of $1.73 billion, down 2.3% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 3.3%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin estimates but a miss of analysts’ organic revenue estimates. Russ Becker, APi’s President and Chief Executive Officer stated: “APi delivered strong financial results in the second quarter and the first half of the year. The business continues to perform well, with double digit U.S. Life Safety inspection growth, record adjusted EBITDA margin, and record free cash flow generation. I believe our leaders’ can generate continued momentum in the business, build on historically strong execution, consistently drive margin expansion, and return to historical levels of organic growth in the back half of the year and into 2025. We believe we can create sustainable shareholder value by focusing on our long-term value creation targets and we feel confident in our ability to achieve our 13% or more adjusted EBITDA margin target in 2025. \"                     ",

That compares with 13% in the last decade, and a long-term average of 11%. They also see a roughly 72% chance that the benchmark index will trail Treasury bonds, and a 33% likelihood they’ll lag inflation through 2034. “Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are toward the lower end of their typical performance distribution,” the team wrote in a note dated Oct. 18. US equities have rallied following the global financial crisis, first driven by near-zero interest rates and later by bets on resilient economic growth. The S&P 500 is on track to outperform the rest of the world in eight of the last 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, this year’s 23% bounce has been concentrated in a handful of the biggest technology stocks. The Goldman strategists said they expect returns to broaden out and the equal-weighted S&P 500 to outperform the market cap-weighted benchmark in the next decade. Even if the rally were to remain concentrated, the S&P 500 would post below-average returns of about 7%, they said. The latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey showed investors expect the US equity rally to extend into the final stretch of 2024. The strength of Corporate America’s results are seen as more crucial for the stock market’s performance than who wins the US presidential election or even the Federal Reserve’s policy path.

The implications of the new Medicare payout levels, in fact, prompted the Louisville-based group to file a lawsuit in federal court last week, accusing the government of being “arbitrary and capricious” in calculating its reimbursements for the country's second-largest Medicare Advantage provider behind UnitedHealth  (UNH) . Fairfax Media/Getty Images Others in the sector are struggling with the new payout levels following a decision by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services earlier this spring that capped Medicare Advantage payments by an average of 3.7% next year. Analysts were looking for an increase of around 4.7%, based on CMS's January proposal of 3.7%, followed by an increase of around 1.22% each year between 2019 and 2024. Related: Humana hit by troubling Medicare Advantage change The payments, which reimburse insurers for treatments of U.S. patients over age 65, will be effectively lower than current levels when adjusted for costs and inflation. UnitedHealth shares fell more than 5% last week after it reported a big jump in its medical-cost ratio, a gauge of the amount the group is collecting from premiums against the payouts it needs to make to customers, and issued a muted 2025 profit forecast. CVSHealth  (CVS) , meanwhile, slumped nearly 10% after it slashed its full-year profit forecast in May and posted a near 6 percentage-point surge in the benefit-expense ratio at Aetna, its health insurance unit. To arrest that rise and boost sales and profits at its retail pharmacy division, CVS said Friday that it had replaced CEO Karen Lynch, who was appointed in 2021, with CVS Caremark President David Joyner. Related: CVS Health stock crushed as Medicare Advantage hit triggers big changes Humana, meanwhile, is looking to revive merger talks with Cigna Group  (CI) , according to a late Friday report from Bloomberg. It may seek to consolidate in the face of the massive sector changes ahead. Talks between the two companies, which emerged last year, broke down quickly, however, amid concern that the Federal Trade Commission would prevent a merger.            ",

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks edged back from their all-time highs Monday as some of the steam came out of Wall Street’s long, record-breaking rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, coming off a sixth straight winning week, its longest such streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 344 points, or 0.8%, from its own record that was likewise set on Friday, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. Trading was mixed in markets around the world. Crude oil prices rose to regain some of last week’s sharp losses, while U.S. Treasury yields climbed and stock indexes mostly fell in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia. The rise in yields helped knock down stocks that tend to get hurt by higher interest rates, such as big dividend payers and businesses in the housing industry. Real-estate stocks fell to the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 index, while homebuilders Lennar and D.R. Horton both fell at least 4.3%. Home Depot’s 2.1% drop was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. The declines mean at least a pause in Wall Street’s rally to records, which was built in large part on optimism that the U.S. economy can make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a painful recession that many investors had worried could be inevitable. With the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. But critics are warning that stock prices look too expensive given how much faster they’ve climbed than corporate profits. That puts pressure on companies to deliver growth in profits to justify their stock prices, and more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to give details this week about their performances during the summer. That includes such heavyweights as AT&T, Coca-Cola, IBM, General Motors and Tesla. Tesla slipped 0.8% ahead of its report. Its stock has been shaky recently, including a tumble after an update on its highly anticipated robotaxi included fewer details than investors were hoping for. Boeing is reporting its latest results on Wednesday. It rose 3.1% after reaching an agreement with the union representing its striking machinists on a contract proposal. The union’s members could vote Wednesday on the deal, which could end a costly walkout that has crippled production of airplanes for more than a month. Spirit Airlines soared 53.1% after the carrier was able to extend a credit-card processing agreement. Coming into the day, the airline’s stock had lost 91% in the year so far following the cancellation of its planned merger with JetBlue.           ",

        "body": "“Bear” and “bull” are two terms used to describe different parts of the market cycle, and they can tell investors a lot about what’s going on in the economy. A bear market is a prolonged decline in stock prices. A bull market is a prolonged rise in prices. Understanding what a bull market looks like compared to a bear market can be helpful when it comes to making informed investment decisions. Here’s a breakdown of what each type of market entails, how bull and bear markets work, and how to invest during both. A bull market is the opposite of a bear market and occurs when asset prices rise significantly over a long period of time, commonly defined as a 20% or more increase from their most recent low. A bull market can also refer to a price spike in a specific market. Bull markets typically happen alongside a growing or strong economy, a solid gross domestic product (GDP), rising corporate profits that lift stock prices, and lower unemployment. In the same way a bear market can shake investor confidence, a bull market can boost investor confidence, thus driving returns higher too. Bull markets tend to be longer than bear markets, lasting an average of five years. Over the years, the stock market has seen many bull runs, which happen on average every six years. The longest bull market to date started in March 2009 and ran through February 2020. The S&P 500 has had 13 bull markets since 1946. There isn’t a hard-and-fast rule, but some analysts describe a bear market as a decline of 20% or more off recent highs in the market across a broad range of asset classes. A bear market might also be confined to an asset class. Bear markets tend to occur before an economic downturn and may signal a recession. Some notable bear markets include the Great Depression, the dot-com bubble, the Great Recession and as the pandemic started in February 2020, which is one of the shortest bear markets at 33 days. Bear markets can be caused by a slowing or sluggish economy, high inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical instability, substantial shifts in the economy and other factors that impact investor sentiment and create uncertainty. Bear markets tend to be shorter than bull markets, lasting about 10 to 12 months on average in the S&P 500. There have been 13 bear markets in the S&P 500 since 1946, an average of one every six years. It can be helpful to think of bull and bear markets as generally opposites to one another, but here’s a side-by-side look at what each type entails.                              "

You Would Be Surprised “When Trump was elected, expectations were that technology would underperform and financials and energy would outperform,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments. “The exact opposite was true.” That isn’t stopping investors from trying to get an edge. Here are some of the ways they are trying to profit from—or hedge against—the outcome. Betting markets that let people wager on election outcomes aren’t new. A recent court ruling legalized them in the U.S. Prediction markets such as Kalshi and Interactive Brokers’ ForecastEx let investors purchase contracts that pay out about $1 if a chosen candidate wins, or nothing if the bet is wrong. Contract prices fluctuate based on demand and the perceived odds of a candidate’s winning. Some prediction markets have shifted sharply in favor of former President Donald Trump since the beginning of October, when they showed the presidential race was nearly deadlocked. On Polymarket, a platform that isn’t open to Americans, a contract that pays out if Trump wins cost around 60 cents on Friday, compared with 40 cents for Vice President Kamala Harris. In theory, betting markets offer a real-time look at election-outcome expectations, with real money on the line. But a recent flurry of wagers among four big accounts on Polymarket are raising questions about who is behind them. The latest polls show the two candidates are nearly deadlocked in the key swing states that will decide the election. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, the Trump-backed parent company of Truth Social, have been a volatile playground for traders who are trying to predict the outcome of the race. Often referred to by the ticker DJT, the company’s nearly $6 billion market value belies its fundamentals, which include less than $2 million in reported revenue in the most recent quarter. DJT has achieved meme-stock status, attracting day traders, and its performance has often been tied to Trump’s perceived election chances.                      "

(NYSE:VZ) will release earnings results for its third quarter, before the opening bell on Tuesday, Oct. 22, Analysts expect the New York-based company to report quarterly earnings at $1.18 per share. That’s up from $1.11 per share in the year-ago period. Verizon projects to report revenue of $33.43 billion for the recent quarter, compared to $30.48 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. United States Cellular Corporation (NYSE:USM) recently agreed to sell part of its retained spectrum licenses to Verizon for $1 billion. With the recent buzz around Verizon, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Verizon offers an annual dividend yield of 6.16%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 67.75 cents per share ($2.71 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Verizon, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Verizon $2.71 dividend: $6,000 / $2.71 = 2,214 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $97,394 worth of Verizon, or 2,214 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.71 = 443 shares, or $19,488 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. View more earnings on VZ Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. VZ Price Action: Shares of Verizon gained by 0.3% to close at $43.99 on Friday.

Let’s take a look at how electrical systems stocks fared in Q2, starting with OSI Systems (NASDAQ:OSIS). Like many equipment and component manufacturers, electrical systems companies are buoyed by secular trends such as connectivity and industrial automation. More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products. The 14 electrical systems stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Luckily, electrical systems stocks have performed well with share prices up 10.8% on average since the latest earnings results. With a name reflecting its initial focus on optical sensors, OSI Systems (NASDAQ:OSIS) is a designer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems and components. OSI Systems reported revenues of $480.9 million, up 16.8% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ Security revenue estimates and full-year revenue guidance exceeding analysts’ expectations.

        "body": "The stock market stunned Wall Street last year with a massive gain, and it could top that this year with an even bigger surge. Helped by a U.S. economy that remained strong despite widespread predictions for a recession as well as a dovish shift in tone from the Federal Reserve last fall, the S&P 500 jumped 24% in 2023. Only a handful of Wall Street analysts expected a rally of that magnitude, leading to skepticism that another huge leap was possible in 2024. In fact, JPMorgan predicted the S&P 500 would drop sharply this year. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley expected an average year with returns in the single digits, not a repeat of double-digit gains. Fast forward to today, and the S&P 500 is already up 23% so far in 2024, nearly matching last year's advance. That's despite the Fed beginning its rate-cutting cycle later than hoped and with fewer cuts anticipated for the year. Instead of being fueled by Fed rate cuts, the stock market rally has had other catalysts: the economy has continued to defy expectations with its robustness, corporate earnings have come in strong, and the AI boom still has legs. In recent weeks, Wall Street has been warming up to the idea of another big gain. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said the S&P 500 would hit 6,000 by the end of the year and 6,300 a year from now. That was up from Goldman’s earlier predictions that the S&P 500 would reach 5,600 by year’s end and 6,000 over the next 12 months. If the broad stock market index hits that target, it would represent an increase of 26% for the year. Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, has been saying for months that the S&P 500 would end the year at 6,000. That assumes the U.S. election produces a divided government, which is more likely to lead to stable regulatory policy and lower government spending, he reiterated in a recent note. And on Friday, Sandra Cho, founder and president of Pointwealth Capital Management, told CNBC that she sees the S&P 500 finishing the year at about 6,000. \"We're in the soft-landing camp,\" she said. \"We definitely feel like the Fed has done a pretty good job. There's been a couple of hiccups, but [it] has done a pretty good job as far as factoring in inflation and managing what's going on, especially with the geopolitical events happening.\" Of course, not everyone is convinced that the good times will keep on rolling. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who wrote the book The Black Swan about unpredictable events, said the current environment is similar to what existed during previous collapses, pointing to complacency in the market and the earlier era of low rates that taught people to avoid conservative investments.

He advised investors to pay attention to key sectors and add \"insurance\" to their portfolios. A number of Wall Street forecasters have been warning of a stock bubble as the market climbs to a series of fresh highs in 2024 — and investors worried about such a scenario should be putting their money in a handful of assets to protect themselves from the eventual bursting. That's according to David Rosenberg, a top economist and the founder of Rosenberg Research, who's been warning of a potential craash in stocks for months. In the past, he's warned of a 39% correction to stocks, among the more extreme predictions on Wall Street, where most investors are feeling optimistic about a soft landing amid a robust economy and easing interest rates. \"Watching the market these days is like watching a clown blowing up a balloon (or Chuck Prince dancing the ballroom), knowing the inevitable,\" Rosenberg said in a note to clients on Friday. \"When this mega-bubble pops, it will be spectacular.\" Investors need to exercise caution and avoid following the \"herd mentality,\" Rosenberg said, pointing to the fervor for mega-cap tech stocks. Instead, he said, investors should focus on stocks with strong business models, strong growth, and good prices, and add some \"insurance\" to their portfolios. Below are his top investment ideas for to prepare for the potential bursting of a market bubble. Healthcare and consumer staples Investors should gear their investments towards what people will always need in the future. In particular, Rosenberg recommended that investors pay attention to options in the healtcare and consumer staples sectors. \"Focus on where people are going to focus on what they need, not what they want,\" Rosenberg wrote. \"Anything related to e- commerce, cloud services, and wiring up your home to become your new office has been in a budding secular growth phase.\" Utilities Utility stocks also look promising. Other forecasters have predicted huge upside for utility firms, due to the growing need for power and data centers stemming from the AI boom. \"Utilities, as we have been saying for a long time, are as close to a 'no brainer' as there is, given their yield attributes and their being re-rated for 'defensive growth' owing to enhanced earnings visibility through the strong and secular outlook for US power needs,\" Rosenberg said.

Stocks ended mixed on Monday, with a modest decline for the S&P 500, a larger pullback for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a gain for the tech-focused Nasdaq as bond markets returned to their recent volatility. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, rose 11 basis points on the session, while adding another in overnight trading, and were last marked at a three month high of 4.208% heading into the New York session. Merrill Lynch's MOVE index, which tracks fixed income volatility and is known as the 'VIX for bonds', is trading at the highest levels of the year and is up nearly 48.6% from its early July lows. Messaging from Federal Reserve officials that suggested a slower pace of rate cuts, election uncertainty and the prospect of higher deficits regardless of who wins the White House and renewed inflation concerns tied to the outperforming economy have all combined to drive yields higher. The moves are sapping risk sentiment in markets around the world, and driving the dollar index to multi-month highs against a basket of its global peers. That's being played out in this mornings premarket session, where futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 suggest a 28 point pullback, with the Dow called 200 points lower and the Nasdaq poised of a 130 point decline.

The aerospace giant has struggled with manufacturing problems, management turmoil, horrible financial results, and, since September, a crippling labor strike. Boeing saw a little ray of sunshine on Oct. 21. Over the weekend, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said its 33,000 members will vote on a new contract from Boeing  (BA) , which is among the most iconic of U.S. companies. Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter The vote will come Oct. 23, and there's hope — but hardly any certainty — that the contract will pass. Indeed, some analysts think it won't pass because of the negative comments from Boeing workers that they've seen on social media. Related: Goldman Sachs reveals long-term S&P 500 outlook Nonetheless, Boeing shares were up 4.8% to $159.82 on Oct. 21, their highest close since Sept. 4. The stock was the top performer of stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and third best among stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Boeing shares, however, are still down 38.6% on the year and more than 40% from their 52-week high reached in December 2023. The union agreed early on Oct. 19 to put Boeing's latest proposal — its third in less than two months — to its membership, saying that it was \"worthy of your consideration.\" The strike began on Sept. 13 after 94% of union members rejected an offer supported by union management. The union refused even to consider a second Boeing offer. The new proposal calls for 35% salary increase over four years, up from 30% offered earlier by Boeing. It also boosts the ratification bonus to $7,000 from the previous $6,000 offer. The one demand Boeing refused to consider was re-establishing its traditional pension plan. Boeing has said that average annual pay for machinists is currently $75,608. The strike by workers in Washington, Oregon, and California has halted production of Boeing 737s including the 737 Max, and 767s and 777s. Boeing is continuing to build 787 Dreamliners at a nonunion plant near Charleston, S.C. The strike is costing Boeing an estimated $1 billion a month, and new CEO Kelly Ortberg is working to keep the company afloat. Boeing is raising up to $25 billion through stock and debt offerings. It's arranging a $10 billion credit agreement with major lenders amid a production and regulatory crisis. Bloomberg/Getty Images Analysts at JP Morgan, led by Seth Seifman, kept their rating on Boeing at overweight with a $195 price target. But the group noted the deal, if passed, will boost Boeing's costs by at least $1 billion a year.               ",

Let’s take a look at how Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) and the rest of the cybersecurity stocks fared in Q2. Cybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location. The 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. In light of this news, cybersecurity stocks have held steady with share prices up 3% on average since the latest earnings results. Founded in 2000 with the idea that network security comes before endpoint security, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) provides software as a service that helps companies understand where they are exposed to cyber security risks, quickly detect breaches and respond to them. Rapid7 reported revenues of $208 million, up 9.2% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with accelerating customer growth and full-year revenue guidance exceeding analysts’ expectations. “Rapid7 delivered solid second quarter results in line with our expectations, growing ARR by 9% year-over-year to $816 million, and continuing to innovate to bring customers the strongest security operations data platform,” said Corey Thomas, Chairman and CEO of Rapid7.

Nvidia  (NVDA)  has been the big kahuna. The dominant provider of semiconductors for AI applications has seen its stock price more than triple during that period. 🐂 Free Newsletter From TheStreet - TheStreet 🐻 Some experts, such as Harvard economist Larry Summers, consider AI equal in importance to the Industrial Revolution. MANDEL NGAN/Getty Images “This offers the prospect of not replacing some forms of human labor, but almost all forms of human labor,” he said at Fortune's Innovation Forum earlier this year. “AI will substitute for a doctor making a difficult diagnosis … before it substitutes for a nurse’s ability to hold a patient’s hand when the patient is frightened,” he said. But not everyone is convinced AI will be such a big deal. It’s certainly not a big factor yet, says Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs. “We're a couple years into this, and there's not a single thing that this is being used for that's cost effective at this point,” he said in a Goldman podcast. Related: Nvidia stock hits record high as key AI player smashes Q3 earnings Trillions of dollars are set to be spent on developing AI infrastructure, such as data centers and applications, Covello noted. So what trillion-dollar problem is AI going to solve, he asks. This technology transition differs from any he’s seen in the last 30 years. “Historically, we've always had a very cheap solution replacing a very expensive solution,” Covello said. “Here, you have a very expensive solution that's meant to replace low-cost labor. That doesn't even make any sense from the jump.” If you do want to invest in AI, “keep buying the infrastructure provider stocks,” he said in the June-July podcast. Related: Open AI is burning cash (and losing billions!) “Is it really expensive? Absolutely. But I've never seen a stock that goes down only because it's expensive. It got expensive for a reason. People believe in the fundamental growth outlook.” Covello said if the stock drops, it will be due to a growth problem, not because of the valuation. Investment legend Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO money management firm ($66 billion of assets), takes an inverse view to Covello.

Cigna’s stock dropped as much as 3.2% at the New York market open Monday following a Bloomberg News report late Friday that the insurance giants had revived discussions. Humana shares rose as much as 3.1% on Monday. The companies abandoned merger talks late last year after the sides couldn’t agree on a price, Bloomberg reported in December. Since then, however, Humana’s shares lost more than 40% of their value through Friday’s close, as the Medicare-focused insurer struggled with rising care expenses and stricter federal payment policies. The company’s stock price plunged this month on a surprise downgrade to crucial Medicare quality scores linked to billions in government payments. The insurer is contesting those ratings. Humana “may want to get paid for a view that the inherent earnings of the business is materially higher” than an offer based on its current stock price would reflect, Leerink Partners analyst Whit Mayo wrote. A deal would draw attention from antitrust regulators, who might try to block it, TD Cowen analyst Ryan Langston wrote. “Any formal announcement before the presidential election seems highly unlikely,” he wrote. Cigna, meanwhile, is exiting the Medicare market and has been a bright spot during a difficult year for US health insurers. Its shares rose about 30% since the merger talks ended last year through Friday’s closing price. “Strategically, we think this deal make sense, the financial part is harder to support,” Mayo wrote.

In a Thursday note, the analysts raised their price objective on the stock from $165 to $190. That implies a 38% upside from its price of about $138 a share at midday on Friday. The analysts point to exponential growth in the AI market in the coming years, which they say will give Nvidia a \"generational opportunity\" as the chip titan continues to strengthen its lead in the market. The analysts see the AI accelerator market growing to $280 billion by 2027, and toward upwards of $400 billion over time — marking huge growth from $45 billion in 2023. As AI models continue to grow rapidly—with developers like OpenAI, Google, and Meta launching new large language models several times per year—the need for computing will only grow, the analysts predict. Each new major LLM generation, especially those developed for larger size and better reasoning capabilities, will require greater training intensity, they add. \"We continue to see the pace of new model development increase. LLMs in particular are being developed for both larger size and better reasoning capabilities, which both require greater training intensity,\" the analysts said. They also point to Nvidia's strong partnerships with enterprise customers like Accenture, ServiceNow, Oracle, and others, which show the growing presence of AI at big companies and Nvidia's role as partner of choice. \"NVDA's engagements span multiple verticals (e.g., Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft), and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side,\" the analysts said. The analysts also said Nvidia's financials are set up well for future gains. Given its free cash flow generation at 45%-50% margins, which is nearly double that of other Magnificent 7 stocks, Nvidia will be able to generate $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, they wrote. Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed this year, up 187% as AI continues to boom after a brief sell-off over the summer. The sector has since recovered, with chip stocks like Nvidia and TSMC trading at or near all-time highs in recent weeks. Read the original article on Business Insider "

        "body": "(Bloomberg) — The trading debut of Tokyo Metro Co., which runs one of the world’s largest subway systems, is set to support the bull case for the Japanese stock market after an oversubscribed public offering. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance Japan’s biggest listing in six years got more than 15 times demand, some of the underwriters said Tuesday. The sale is a key gauge of appetite for Japanese shares just days before a crucial election that may shape expectations for further interest-rate rises. The initial public offering of Tokyo Metro, which runs an extensive network of underground train services in the world’s most-populous metropolitan area, raised ¥348.6 billion ($2.3 billion) as investors were attracted by its reputation for safety and reliability. The IPO priced at the top of the range, indicating hot demand for a stable stock with a juicy dividend yield that drew in retail buyers. The listing brings into focus the contrast between Tokyo’s efficient, government-owned subway system, and counterparts in major global cities such as New York and London, which are weighed down by debt and aging infrastructure. “This is an attractive asset with brand recognition,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at financial-advisory firm Astris Advisory Japan. “The financials are generally stable, not a lot of volatility.” Foreign investors in particular sought more than 35 times the amount of shares on offer to them, the underwriters said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The IPO price of ¥1,200 and Tokyo Metro’s estimated dividend of ¥40 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2025 gives a 3.3% yield. That compares with less than 2% for ground transport companies in Japan, according to data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as of end-September. On top of that come perks for investors such as free train tickets and golf, which Hiroaki Tomori, executive fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., estimates would increase the dividend yield to 4.9%. That’s an attractive in a country where years of ultra-low rates have starved investors of returns. “Investors who have had no experience in stock trading felt that it was like a festival and wanted to apply for the commemorative issue,” said Yutaka Tokushige, manager of the business promotion division at the head office of FFG Securities Co., one of the underwriters.

To me, everything has a place. Awesome desk organization, awesome outcomes, is how my head works. But I broke this rule slightly by the close of trading on Friday. Going forward, I will have a paper cutout of Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang in his trademark leather jacket thumbtacked to the wallboard (see pic below). And I'll tell you why. For one full day this week I forgot to check Nvidia's stock price my usual 10 times a day — only checking in five times. I let myself (and you all) down because, in the blink of an eye, Nvidia's stock went from a quick sell-off from the Monday record highs back to those same highs come the end of the week. I missed it! The stock is up 13% in October, dusting the 1.4% gain for the S&P 500. AMD's (AMD) stock is down by 5% this month, similar to Intel (INTC). So Jensen's face on my desk is a reminder to check in with Nvidia's stock price and fundamentals numerous times a day. And to ask everyone I encounter about Nvidia, even people not in the chip space (as I did at one annual CEO dinner this week hosted by ServiceNow's (NOW) CEO Bill McDermott). Here's what I was reminded of by recommitting to an Nvidia obsession: Something insanely bad from a company-specific perspective will be the only thing taking this market darling down for any prolonged period of time. To be honest with you, I don't see where that insanely bad stuff would sprout from over the next few quarters. Neither do the array of plugged-in characters I chat up each week. \"I don't think when you get to Nvidia, there is any hype at all. I have known Jensen for decades, and he is the real deal. What these guys are doing is very real and very powerful,\" C3.ai (AI) founder and CEO Tom Siebel told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). Hey Sam Altman, you should watch what Siebel thinks about your latest valuation... Anyhow, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Antonio Neri has known Jensen for ages. I didn't get the sense Nvidia's products were anything but super hot sellers in a chat with him, yours truly, and Seana Smith on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. \"When you think about the large-scale [cloud] providers, what they want is to come to market with the latest technologies. And obviously, Blackwell is a key component of that as they go from air-cooled to the liquid cooling, more power density and more performance, and they are on track to do that,\" Neri said about Nvidia.

        "body": "By Iain Withers and Sinead Cruise LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's commercial property market is returning to life after its post-pandemic freeze, albeit largely at much lower prices. Some big-ticket office properties now on sale will show just where the market is likely to bottom out and how briskly UK deal volumes will recover - especially in the hard-hit office market. How that plays out could in turn signal what awaits other countries still gripped by a deeper downturn. Real estate investor Nuveen has put a 21-storey City of London tower it completed in 2019, informally known as the \"Can of Ham\" due to its rounded shape, up for sale for 322 million pounds ($419 million), below about 400 million pounds it had sought in 2022, a person familiar with the matter said. Canada's Brookfield is seeking around 500 million pounds for its nearby Citypoint tower, according to industry data provider CoStar. That compares with its most recent formal valuation of 670 million pounds, and its 560 million price tag when last sold in 2016, according to CoStar. New office buildings are seeing robust demand, with investor M&G's new office towers at 40 Leadenhall in the City of London more than 80% let. But a recent tour showed what it needed to do to attract tenants, with the building offering saunas, treatment rooms, a hair salon, a yoga room, Peloton fitness suite, a cinema room and a library - most for the exclusive use of office tenants. \"We had a conviction that tenants would want to upgrade their space,\" said Martin Towns, deputy global head of M&G Real Estate. Some out-of-favour older offices would have to be converted into other uses like housing, or demolished, he said. The COVID-19 pandemic pummelled global commercial property markets by driving up inflation and financing costs, while causing a shift to hybrid and remote work that meant most tenants wanted less, but higher quality office space. The cost of building prime offices in London has risen to more than 500 pounds per square foot now from less than 400 pounds before the pandemic, construction consultancy Turner & Townsend alinea said. Half of that increase was down to inflation, with the rest down to better amenities and green credentials, it said. While some properties, such as older out-of-town offices, remain near-impossible to sell, the British market is improving for prime offices, rental housing and logistics, investors said. A global retreat in inflation and interest rates is starting to ease financing costs and improve properties' appeal relative to other investments.               "

        "body": "The French media giant behind the Paddington films is seeking a valuation of up to €8bn (£6.7bn) when it lists on the London Stock Exchange, which would make it the largest debut listing of the year. Canal+, which owns Paddington producer StudioCanal, is expected to appear on the LSE in mid-December as part of a spinout by its parent company Vivendi. City sources said the debut is likely to value Canal+ in a range between €6bn and €8bn – which would give the embattled market a much-needed boost. London has faced a dearth of new companies coming to the market this year, with the £540m Raspberry Pi float and £400m listing of Applied Nutrition the only notable debuts. A listing of Canal+ would be the largest deal for the London market since 2022 when healthcare giant Haleon was spun out by GSK and Pfizer in a £31bn deal. Canal+ would be big enough to be in the FTSE 100, although it is unclear if the group will join the blue chip index. Much like Sky in the UK, Canal+ operates a pay-TV service which combines its own channels with access to streaming platforms such as Netflix, Disney and Apple TV. It also owns StudioCanal, a major production business behind films including the Paddington series, Bridget Jones’s Diary, Johnny English and About a Boy. Canal+ operates in more than 50 countries worldwide, with almost two thirds of its subscribers now outside of its home market in France. It is currently in the process of taking over MultiChoice, Africa’s largest pay-TV operator, in a deal worth almost $3bn (£2.4bn) that will expand the group’s international footprint further. Canal+ is understood to have chosen the LSE because of its appeal to international investors. The listing forms part of a wider break-up of Vivendi, the French media conglomerate controlled by billionaire Vincent Bolloré. Vivendi plans to float its Havas advertising agency in Amsterdam, while also creating a new investment division centred on its publishing subsidiary Lagardère. The final part of Vivendi will remain listed in Paris and oversee a portfolio of investments, most notably the group’s 10pc stake in Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record company. The break-up plan has been orchestrated by Mr Bolloré, the 72-year-old industrialist and corporate raider who is Vivendi’s largest shareholder. The patriarch stood down as chairman in 2018, handing over control to his son Yannick. However, he still exerts a strong influence over the business, which has been struggling for direction since the blockbuster flotation of Universal in 2021. Vivendi has said it hopes the break-up will boost its valuations. The company has argued it suffers from a “significant” share price discount because of its status as a sprawling conglomerate.           ",

The price target represents ~8 times Moley’s new 2026 revenue EPS estimate (up from ~7 times 2026 previously) to reflect the incremental revenue opportunity presented by adding index options & futures. Last week, Robinhood hosted its first inaugural Robinhood Markets Summit 2024 and introduced several new products to its customer base. Also Read: Microsoft, Salesforce Battle Heats Up As AI Agent Technology Takes Center Stage In addition to the latest web-based trading platform (“Robinhood Legend”), Robinhood Markets reiterated plans to launch index options and futures trading in the coming months and revealed details on pricing. In index options, Gold subscribers will pay $0.35 per contract, and non-gold subscribers will pay $0.50 per contract. In futures, Gold subscribers will pay $0.50 per contract, and non-gold subscribers will pay $0.75 per contract. Given these pricing disclosures, the analyst raised his 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates by ~5%. He increased his 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates by 4 cents each from $0.67 and $0.87 to $0.71 and $0.91. Moley’s base case for 2025-26 assumes index options are ~10% accretive to Robinhood Markets’ total options volume, futures trading accounts for ~5% of Robinhood Markets’ total DARTs, and Gold customers account for 75% of volumes in both index options and futures trading, as for Moley. This is uncharted territory for Robinhood Markets, which built a brand as the zero-commission online broker for the masses, he added. The more compelling near-term opportunity for Robinhood Markets could lie with active retail traders on competitor platforms drawn in by Robinhood Markets’ lower prices. Moley noted that these product launches for Robinhood Markets will likely put pricing pressure on the incumbents in both index options and futures trading. Moley summed up that while Robinhood Markets’ offering might not be as robust as its competitors, the combination of its new web platform, incentive match programs, and lower pricing on popular tools for active retail traders might just be enough to win market share among more sophisticated, active retail traders.

Per Reuters, Wall Street expects the company's third-quarter adjusted earnings per share to come in at $6.50 on revenue of $17.28 billion, the latter of which is a 2.8% year-over-year increase. Ahead of the event, LMT is up 0.4% at $614.04, and earlier touched a record high of $618.95. Over the last two years, LMT finished post-earnings sessions higher five times, and averaged a 3.3% pop, regardless of direction. This time around, the options pits expect a next-day swing of 5.6%. Speaking of the options pits, Lockheed Martin stock is seeing higher-than-usual intraday put volume before the earnings call. Around the session's halfway point, 6,156 calls and 4,545 puts have traded hands, with bearish bets running at double the amount usually seen at this point. New positions are opening at the most active, weekly 10/25 540-strike call. Over the last 12 months, the security cleared marked several significant achievements including conquering early 2024 resistance at the $460 level and a mid-summer post-earnings rally that set it on a path of higher highs. LMT now boasts a 35.4% year-to-date lead. Despite LMT's outperformance, analysts still aren't on board. Relative to its current perch, the stock's 12-month consensus target price of $588.77 is a 4.2% discount, and nine of 21 covering brokerages rate it a \"hold\" or worse.

Boeing has struggled since an airplane part ripped off one of its 737 Max 9 planes during a flight in January. Shares are down over 40% this year. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, some 19 recommend buying shares, while 11 have a Hold rating, and three say to sell. On average, analysts see Boeing shares rising to about $192 each over the next 12 months, implying a more than 20% gain.

Equity valuations are stretched, corporate bond spreads are tightening and gold is at a record.

Alongside all the prudence, though, a vocal subset of managers has emerged whose outlook is decidedly less wary. Despite the headwinds facing investors at this point in the economic cycle, they say there’s reason to believe it’s still early in the bull run for risky assets. One is Nancy Tengler, who helps oversee $1.4 billion for Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona. Convinced corporate earnings growth is greater than it seems thanks to a steep falloff in inflation that is also bolstering consumers, she’s pushing clients out of Treasuries and into a broader list of bets on municipal bonds, electrical equipment makers and utilities. “The growth is there and it’s still driven by the consumer,” she said. “Earnings season will be pretty robust. We will see more surprises to the upside than to the downside. We are very bullish.” Stocks rose again this week, with the S&P 500 climbing almost 1% for its sixth straight gain, the longest streak since December. Ten-year Treasury yields were little changed after a four-week advance spurred by the unwinding of bets on outsized interest-rate reductions. In credit, the iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF started the week with its best three-day advance since mid-September, while oil had its first weekly decline this month. The simplest case for optimism remains the economy, where Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve is undoing two years of restrictive policy as inflation subsides. Data this week showed both the US consumer and labor market are holding up, while bank executives issued almost unanimously positive outlooks as earnings broadly beat expectations. On Thursday, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracking estimate saw another upward revision, and is now forecasting third-quarter GDP at 3.4%. To Philip Camporeale, a multi-asset portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, it’s almost as if the economic cycle is “aging backwards and extending, because the Fed is easing policy with a very low probability of recession,” he said. “Macro volatility is lower today than it’s been over the last two years,” he added. Camporeale maintained the overweight in stocks relative to bonds he’s had all year and is adding riskier bets such as emerging markets equities.                "

Baby’s first home has some staying power, not unlike Fisher Prices’ other non-biodegradable heirlooms, according to new research by Edelman Financial Engines. High interest rates are keeping Americans tied to their abode: Over a third (36%) of homeowners report feeling stuck in their house and unable to move for said reason. This rises to nearly 50% for homeowners under 50, who are mostly made up of Gen Z and millennials. But even some young Gen Xers in this group are finding themselves in dire straits. Last year, the Fed raising interest rates sent mortgages to a 22-year high. While the rates have since ebbed, many homeowners are feeling still a little burnt by the market. Many (72%) Americans report being concerned about the current rates, rising to 81% for those under 50. Part of the issue is that because the market is so thorny, many young Americans are forced to pour all their money into their first home. To afford a median-priced starter home, prospective buyers must earn about $80,000 a year, per Redfin. Then their salary isn’t rising enough to keep up with their desire to move from an apartment to that three-bedroom house with a garage, like their parents did. “Americans need to earn more than a year ago—and much more than before the pandemic—to afford a starter home because mortgage rates are elevated, and home prices are near record highs,” reads the report. Most Americans are, therefore, priced out. Just over half of households (50.1%) earn $75,000 or less, according to U.S. Census data, points out Fortune’s Alena Botros The situation is so dire that wannabe presidents have taken note in order to curry favor with Americans. “I’ve been doing housing for a long time. It is the first time that I could remember where both sides are talking about housing,” Fannie Mae CEO and president Priscilla Almodovar said at Fortune’s MPW Summit of the presidential election, noting that it demonstrates the “affordability crisis” at large. It all means that once Americans can finally get their hands on a home, they’re not able to release. With so much liquidity in one investment, it can be hard to re-enter the market and afford increasingly expensive property. And on the other hand, older homeowners are often not looking to move and give up their relatively low mortgage rates they once had.           "

Analysts are also boosting their end-of-year targets for the benchmark, which is now within just 2.5% of a 6,000-point mark that seemed impossible to scale just a few months ago. 🐂 Sign UP Today: Free Newsletter From TheStreet - TheStreet 🐻 The long bull rally, which began more than two years ago, however, faces a key test from the bond market over the coming weeks. Investors have marked up Treasury yields in the face of resurgent inflation risks and reckless fiscal spending promises from both Presidential candidates that threaten even larger debt and deficit levels. Benchmark 10-year paper hit the highest levels since late July in early Monday trading, changing hands at 4.138% extending a slump that has added more than 50 basis points to the most important interest rate in world financial markets. It must be noted that that move followed an outsized 50 basis points rate cut from the Federal Reserve in mid-September, a decision that some investors are now wondering may stoke inflation pressures. The economy continues its above-trend growth, oil prices remain elevated amid geopolitical tensions in the Persian Gulf region, and the job market consistently surprises to the upside. For the moment, however, stocks are poised to extend their longer-term run despite trading at 22 times future earnings estimates, a valuation level that is considered expensive in historical terms. \"October's stock market is bucking the historical trend with remarkably little volatility,\" \"While there are plenty of reasons why stocks should be choppy, from election uncertainty to rising geopolitical tensions, the market is overlooking all of these worries as it's become clear that a soft landing is upon us,\" said David Laut, chief investment officer at Abound Financial in Granite Bay, California.

Last week, Lucid said it expected the offering to raise $1.67 billion but on Monday the company said the offering had raised nearly $1.75 billion, adding that its expenses are \"dominated by long-term investments.\" Rawlinson said the company has \"five big bunches of cash\" needs including its expansion earlier this year of its plant in Arizona by nearly 3 million square feet and a new plant in Saudi Arabia. \"We're at a sort of capital intensive stage where we're launching the Gravity, we're paying for suppliers' tooling and also ramping up our inventory of parts to produce that,\" Rawlinson said. \"And also we're building out our sales service network internationally.\" Lucid is planning another mid-size crossover model in late 2026. Lucid shares were down 3% on Monday after falling sharply last week following the stock sale. Rawlinson said the future is still rosy for electric vehicles despite some softening in demand. \"I think there's a temporary hiccup here, and there may be a temporary regression,\" Rawlinson said. \"This is a blip.\" He called plug-in electric hybrids a mistake. \"They are the worst of everything, and all the costs of two systems,\" Rawlinson said.

Gold futures (GC=F) touched fresh records, rising as much as 0.8% to hover near highs of $2,750 per ounce. Silver futures (SI=F) gained more than 3% before paring gains, briefly topping $34 per ounce, the highest level in 12 years. The two precious metals have outperformed the broader markets, with bullion rising 26% year to date and silver gaining 35% during the same period, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of 19% since the start of 2024. Gold purchases by central banks, which hit a record in the first quarter of 2024, have been one of the biggest drivers of the precious metal's rise this year. BofA analysts estimate gold has surpassed the euro to become the world's largest reserve asset, second only to the US dollar. Investors have also flocked to physically backed gold exchange-traded funds, with inflow up three months in a row, according to the World Gold Council. \"I think it's the declining inflation expectation and also the rotation of assets that tend to perform well with a more dovish Fed,” Phil Streible, Blue Line Futures chief market strategist, told Yahoo Finance on Monday morning. The strategist sees gold reaching $2,850 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, silver surged higher after gaining more than 6% on Friday. JPMorgan analysts cited sentiment at the recent London Bullion Market Association/London Platinum and Palladium Market conference, with attendees forecasting an average year-ahead price of $45 per ounce for the grey metal. \"This bullish view is driven by a sense that silver is undervalued vs gold, less crowded, and supported by multifaceted, versatile demand applications,\" wrote JPMorgan analysts on Friday. Silver is used across different industries, from electronics to fuel cells in automobile components and solar panels. The analysts see uncertainty ahead for the metal if former President Donald Trump were to win the presidential election. \"We are bullish silver ourselves, though for this strong silver outperformance to eventuate, we likely need to see industrial metals prices continue to rally in 2025, something that could get complicated under a Trump presidency and a hard line on tariffs early next year, despite Chinese stimulus,\" said the note.

APE ecosystem's governance and utility token APE has doubled in value to $1.50 since the weekend, leading the broader market higher. Options activity on PowerTrade, a crypto exchange focused on derivatives tied to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), suggests that the recent strong bullish momentum is expected to persist in the short term. Open interest, or the number of active APE options contracts, surged by over 800% to 263,000 ($394.5K) in one day, PowerTrade told CoinDesk Monday, adding that call options or derivatives, offering an asymmetric upside potential, account for over 80% of the tally. Call buyers are implicitly bullish on the underlying asset. Most activity is concentrated on the Oct. 22 and Oct. 25 expiry contracts, with traders buying higher strike out-of-the-money (OTM) calls at strikes as high as $2.2 or nearly 50% higher than APE's going market price. The activity in APE options is noteworthy, considering the token has a market capitalization of just $1 billion and represents growing sophistication in the altcoin space. That said, open interest and volume are way lower than the billions of dollars locked in BTC and ETH options contracts listed on the leading exchange Deribit. The bullish expectations likely stem from the Apechain mainnet launch and LayerZero's integration. PowerTrade offers European-styled USD-settled options with one contract representing 1 APE as underlying. The exchange debuted the request-for-quote (RFQ) model for the options market in late 2022, allowing the execution of multi-legged strategies as a single instrument.

Many environmental and facility services are non-discretionary (sports stadiums need to be cleaned after events), recurring, and performed through longer-term contracts. This makes for more predictable and stickier revenue streams. Additionally, there has been an increasing focus on emissions and water conservation over the last decade, driving innovation in the sector and demand for new services. Despite these tailwinds, environmental and facility services companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact commercial construction projects that drive incremental demand for these services. The 15 environmental and facilities services stocks we track reported a mixed Q1. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Thankfully, environmental and facilities services stocks have been resilient with share prices up 7.9% on average since the latest earnings results. Spun off from Danaher in 2023, Veralto (NYSE:VLTO) provides water analytics and treatment solutions. Veralto reported revenues of $1.25 billion, up 1.5% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.6%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin estimates and a decent beat of analysts’ earnings estimates.

Like many equipment and component manufacturers, electrical systems companies are buoyed by secular trends such as connectivity and industrial automation. More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products.

The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.

Cikos noted that GitLab has expanded its product offerings, with Ultimate gaining traction due to innovations like Duo Pro Enterprise and Dedicated. The analyst expects increased adoption of Ultimate compared to Premium, driven by stronger Enterprise sales and GitLab’s compliance and security features, which large organizations value. Also Read: GitLab Stock Climbs On Q2 Results, Strong FY 25 Guidance He said premium SKU pricing changes will also contribute to revenue growth, providing a tailwind into fiscal 2026. Cikos noted that strong incremental margins, currently around 40%, support the company’s ability to surpass revenue expectations for the October quarter. The analyst said that the debate over Premium versus Ultimate is less relevant in the current landscape, where Enterprises have larger budgets and favor Ultimate. Recent data from GitLab shows that seven out of the company’s top 10 deals in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were for Ultimate, and 65% of new dollars from $100,000-plus customers came from this tier. Innovations like Dedicated and Duo Pro, exclusive to Ultimate, further enhance its appeal. He added that enterprises offer more significant potential for cross-selling and expansion as they have larger budgets than SMBs. Cikos’ analysis indicates GitLab could exceed subscription revenue estimates for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and beyond. The analyst noted that the premium price increase, customer retention, and churn improvements should contribute to continued growth. Additionally, he anticipates operating margin expansion driven by cost discipline and leverage in the subscription model. In fiscal 2024, GitLab’s revenue grew by $155.6 million, with $85.8 million translating to adjusted operating profit, demonstrating incremental solid margins. Cikos noted that GitLab is well-positioned in a large market, sharing it with Microsoft’s GitHub. However, the analyst noted that GitLab’s focus on security and compliance gives it an edge over organizations prioritizing these features. The company also benefits from its flexible deployment options, which cater to Enterprises at different stages of their cloud journey. As a neutral vendor, GitLab attracts businesses looking to diversify their tech stack and reduce dependency on Microsoft. Cikos anticipates that GitLab will continue growing its public sector presence, aided by its recent product launches and federal security certifications.                              ",

The proposal gives the union workers a 35% pay raise and $7,000 ratification bonus.

Boeing (BA) shares advanced 3% Monday afternoon as the plane maker and its 33,000-member machinists union struck a tentative agreement over the weekend that could end the five-week strike that has crippled the company. The deal includes a 35% bump in wages over four years, a $7,000 ratification bonus, and a boost to members' 401(k) plans, though it would not bring back the traditional pension plans workers wanted. The union said it would be putting the proposal up for a vote on Wednesday. Boeing has been hammered by the walkout, which began Sept. 13.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The response of interest-rate traders to Australia’s recent economic data suggests the Reserve Bank’s policy reaction function is being understood, Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser said. Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says Hauser was speaking Monday in Sydney after rates traders pushed back the expected timing of the first RBA cut to April from February, following strong employment data on Thursday. They had previously been pricing a decent chance of an easing late this year. “I’m not making a comment about whether the absolute level of the curve is priced in the right place or not,” Hauser said at a Commonwealth Bank of Australia conference. “That’s for everyone in this room to make a judgment on but the response of rates to the data does seem to be quite encouraging.” While the RBA raised interest rates to a 12-year high of 4.35%, it has moved more cautiously than many international counterparts. That’s sparked questions over whether it has done enough to cool demand. Hauser said the central bank’s message is that policy is ready to respond in either direction, leaving the door open to a possible late-cycle hike. Underpinning economy-wide demand, data out last week showed the nation’s powerful stretch of hiring extended into September with unemployment holding steady at 4.1%. Australia’s labor market has outshone other developed world peers where tighter monetary policy has pushed jobless rates much higher. Hauser reiterated that the RBA’s strategy is to bring CPI down slowly to protect the labor market, adding inflation in Australia is still “too high.” As a result, he said, RBA rates won’t fall as much or as early as those of other central banks. Economists generally expect the RBA to be a laggard in the global easing cycle, predicting the central bank will start on an easing cycle in February. Last week’s jobs data, along with third-quarter inflation due later this month, will be important inputs for the RBA’s November policy meeting, where it’s expected to leave rates unchanged yet again. “We are data dependent but we’re not data obsessed. We have to take that number in the context of everything else,” Hauser said, referring to the employment release last week. “Activity has been weak, very weak and we haven’t seen the inflation number for the third quarter yet.”           "

Using the data from our partner Ortex.com, which utilizes the latest information from stock lenders to estimate short interest changes for thousands of publicly traded companies, this report will screen for some of biggest changes in short interest as a percentage of free float and days-to-cover ratios while also considering the short interest data on some of the more volatile and heavier-traded names of the week. Based on the availability of data from Ortex, the report tracks the trading period that covers prior Friday through Thursday of this week, excluding holidays. As a basis of comparison for stocks discussed below, the S&P 500 index was up 1.0%, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%, the Russell 2000 index was up 4.2%, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) was up 4.0%, and the Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) up 4.4% in the five-day trading session range through October 17. SHORT INTEREST GAINERS Estimated short interest on Spirit Airlines (SAVE) has continued its year-long upward climb, reaching a new all-time high this week with a four percentage point increase to 34%. It’s been an especially volatile couple of weeks for the discount airline – two Fridays ago, the stock sank nearly 40% following a Wall Street Journal report that in the wake of its failed merger with JetBlue (JBLU), the company was in discussions over the terms of a bankruptcy filing. Shares of Spirit were still down about 32% over the period of the last two weeks and down 11% in the five-day span through Thursday, though the stock bounced higher by 30% afterhours on Friday as it was able to reach a deal with creditors, extending the deadline for a debt restructuring to December. Ortex-reported short interest on Westrock Coffee (WEST) had consolidated a 24 percentage point ascend to 73% from early August through mid-September with about a ten percentage point retreat, though bearish positioning has once again been on the rise over the past two weeks. This week, shorts as a percentage of free float on Westrock were up just over four points from 66.6% to 70.8%, even though the stock appears to have found its footing. Shares had fallen 47% from July-end to their 2024 lows on October 7th, though the stock has since bounced 29% and was up 26% in the five-day period covered through Thursday. Ortex-reported short positioning on CompoSecure (CMPO) saw an upside breach of 60% in mid-September followed by a two-week period of retreat to about 45%. This week however, shorts as a percentage of free float jumped again, rising from 45.1% all the way to 63.1% – a record high. Bearish exposure is tracking the stock price higher as short look to fade the stock advance to its all-time high on Wednesday. CompoSecure shares were up 11% in the five-day period covered through Thursday, and the stock is now up 179% year-to-date.           ",

France's CAC 40 lost 0.3% to 7,516.20, while the German DAX rose 0.4% to 19,526.85. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.5% to 8,281.14. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.3%. In Asian trading, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 1.4% to finish at 38,411.96. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.7% to 8,205.70, while South Korea's Kospi slipped 1.3% to 2,570.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.1% to 20,498.95 and the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% to 3,285.87 following a cut to interest rates that took effect on Monday. “The next two weeks are set to be a wild ride. Volatility has surged across stocks, bonds, and currencies as investors brace for a perfect storm of risks: a hotly contested U.S. election, critical interest-rate decisions in both the U.S. and Europe, the looming threat of a wider Middle East conflict, and the ever-present pressure of quarterly earnings,” Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. On Monday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% and the Dow dropped 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. Wall Street’s rally to records this year has been based on hopes the U.S. economy can escape from the worst inflation in generations without a painful recession that many investors had worried could be inevitable. With the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, optimists hope stocks can rise even further. But critics are warning stock prices look too expensive given they’ve climbed much faster than corporate profits. That puts pressure on companies to deliver growth in profits to justify their stock prices, and more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to give details this week about their performances during the summer. That includes such heavyweights as AT&T, Coca-Cola, IBM, General Motors and Tesla. The Bank of Canada will also announce its latest decision on interest rates Wednesday, where it could cut by half a percentage point. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 20 cents to $69.84 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 18 cents to $74.11 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 150.99 Japanese yen from 150.69 yen. The euro rose to $1.0829 from $1.0819. "

He pushed the drugmaker to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine at lightning speed. The Greek-born CEO’s bold bet paid off. The shot turned Pfizer into a household name, while ringing up tens of billions of dollars in sales. Bourla’s cellphone hummed with calls from leaders around the world. The experience, he said in a commencement speech afterward, showed the virtue of “setting ambitious goals that are seemingly impossible.” A Mystery $30 Million Wave of Pro-Trump Bets Has Moved a Popular Prediction Market You’re Not Paranoid. The Market Is Out to Get You. The $14 Billion Question Dividing OpenAI and Microsoft In Sports, American Socialism Is Beating European Capitalism Regulator Investigates Tesla’s Automated-Driving Feature After Fatal Crash But now Bourla is under attack because Pfizer’s stock price is way down, in part because it miscalculated demand for its Covid-19 vaccine, and some of the ambitious goals Bourla has set in the years since the pandemic have yet to pan out. An activist investor is leading the charge. Starboard Value, a hedge fund that has waged fights in recent months against Autodesk, Salesforce and Tinder parent Match Group, recently took a roughly $1 billion stake in Pfizer. The sides held their first meeting on Wednesday, after Starboard accused the company of pressuring two former executives who had been working with Starboard to express support for Bourla. It’s a moment of reckoning for Bourla, 62, a veterinarian by training who joined Pfizer in his early 30s from academia and moved all over the globe for the company as he climbed the corporate ladder. Bourla enjoys strong support from Pfizer’s board of directors, according to people familiar with the board’s thinking. Members recognize Bourla’s success spearheading the Covid-19 vaccine, and steps he has taken to right the ship over the last year, including multibillion-dollar cost-cutting programs. The CEO has also reorganized the company, creating a separate cancer-drug research unit in a bet that breakthroughs there will bring in billions in new sales. But Pfizer so far has been unable to escape its postpandemic slump. After the Covid-19 emergency receded, sales of the company’s vaccine and antiviral tanked, much more than executives forecast. New drug launches under-delivered. Pfizer’s first stab at the booming anti-obesity market flamed out. Wall Street noticed, sending Pfizer stock down. Today Wall Street values Pfizer at roughly $166 billion, roughly half its peak during the pandemic.                                     ",

        "body": "The ASEAN Light Vehicle (LV) market dropped by 7% YoY in August and 7% YoY from January to August 2024. This negative sales performance was weighed down by double-digit declines in Indonesia and Thailand. In Indonesia, sales plunged by 15% YoY in August and 17% YoY in the first eight months overall. According to Daihatsu’s management, the market was impacted by tightened credit approvals and lower purchasing power. Furthermore, many consumers and businesses adopted a wait-and-see approach around the presidential election in February, and many are likely still waiting until the new president takes office on October 20, 2024, and potentially announces incentives for vehicle sales. Key developments for the Indonesian market include GAIKINDO’s request for a tax cut policy in early October, following the current government’s rejection of GAIKINDO's proposal for tax cut measures in August, as well as the central bank’s surprise interest rate cut from 6.25% to 6.0% in September. However, the interest rate cut is not expected to have a significant impact on LV sales, as it remains high compared to the rate of 3.5% that was seen during the COVID-19 era, and the financial sector may not loosen credit approvals due to high nonperforming loans (NPLs). Due to this negative sentiment, the country’s LV sales will drop by 14% YoY to 799k units in 2024. In Thailand, LV sales continued to decline by 24% YoY in August, resulting in a 23% YoY decrease from January to August. By vehicle type, Passenger Vehicle (PV) and Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) sales fell by 14% YoY and 38% YoY, respectively, in the first eight months. This downturn can be attributed to a weak economy, with financial institutions tightening car loan criteria to mitigate the risk of NPLs, as high household debt undermines consumer purchasing power. It is important to note that household debt has escalated to nearly 90% of GDP from approximately 80% prior to the pandemic. Additionally, the delayed approval of the government budget has resulted in postponements of public projects, adversely affecting LCV sales. The overall outlook for the Thai LV market continues to pose challenges, with sales anticipated to encounter persistent obstacles in the short term. Projections for 2024 now indicate a decline of 24% to 580k units, which would be the lowest level recorded since 2009. Moreover, the severe floods affecting the north and northeast of the country are likely to have adverse effects on agriculture, tourism, and the broader economy. In contrast, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam all experienced sales growth. Malaysia's LV volumes increased by 8% YoY from January to August, with LCVs (accounting for 7% of total sales) dropping by 9% YoY, while the larger PV segment (accounting for 93% of total LV sales) surged by 9% YoY. This indicates that Malaysia’s LV sales were primarily driven by PVs, thanks to the large backlog of orders created by the government's temporary tax cut measures and automakers’ policies to compensate buyers whom companies could not deliver to before the policy expired—particularly the market leader, Perodua.

That’s exactly what she did this week. Investors and analysts are split on Cathie Wood, arguably the most famous investor after Warren Buffett, the legendary billionaire behind Berkshire Hathaway. Supporters hail her as a tech visionary, while critics argue she’s a mediocre money manager with subpar performance. Affectionately dubbed \"Mama Cathie\" by fans, Wood became famous with a staggering 153% return in 2020, gaining popularity through her accessible media appearances. Related: Cathie Wood's net worth: The Ark Invest CEO's wealth & income But her longer-term performance isn't Buffett-esque. Berkshire Hathaway's annualized returns averaged about 20% since inception, approximately double the S&P 500's return over the same time period. However, Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $5.6 billion in assets, is down 10% in 2024, and returns have been negative 26% for the past three years and only 3% for five years. That pales in comparison to the S&P 500. The benchmark index posted positive annualized returns of 36% for one year, 11% for three years, and 16% for five years. Getty Images / SOPA Images Cathie Wood focuses on disruptive innovation and invests in high-growth tech sectors like artificial intelligence, genomics, and blockchain. Her strategy emphasizes long-term potential and cutting-edge technologies despite short-term volatility. Wood maintains that companies in those categories will be game changers, presumably with game-changing returns. However, high-growth stocks tend to be quite volatile, so the Ark funds’ values often fluctuate widely. Morningstar, one of the most popular companies evaluating mutual fund and exchange-traded fund performance, is critical of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF.

Nonetheless, Wall Street is optimistic about certain EV stocks due to their resilient performance in a tough business backdrop and improving financials. We used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to place Nio (NIO), Li Auto (LI), and Tesla (TSLA) against each other to pick the EV stock with the highest upside potential, according to Wall Street analysts. Shares of Chinese EV maker Nio are down more than 42% year-to-date even after witnessing a solid rally in September due to China’s stimulus measures and improving numbers. However, uncertainty about the Chinese government’s measures to support the EV sector and intense competition continue to drag down Nio stock. Despite a tough business backdrop, Nio reported solid deliveries in September. The company delivered 21,181 vehicles, reflecting a 35.4% year-over-year increase. Its Q3 deliveries grew 11.6% to 61,855 vehicles. The September numbers included 832 units of the company’s first mass-market model Onvo L60, which was launched on September 19. Recently, Nio announced that a group of Chinese investors will invest RMB3.3 billion in its subsidiary Nio China, while the company itself will invest an additional RMB10 billion. Reacting to the news, Daiwa analyst Kelvin Lau noted that Nio China is the core operational entity for the company and the cash injection by existing shareholders is a favorable development that supports the business operations. Lau has a Buy rating on Nio stock. HSBC analyst Yuqian Ding lowered the price target for Nio stock to $7.20 from $7.90 but maintained a Buy rating. The analyst has a constructive outlook on Nio’s volumes and margin growth, supported by strong NIO brand sales, the potential for volume expansion for ONVO L60, supply chain cost optimization, and better economies of scale. Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy recommendation on Nio stock based on eight Buys, four Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average Nio stock price target of $6.31 implies about 21% upside potential. See more NIO analyst ratings Shares of Chinese new energy vehicles (NEV) maker Li Auto have rallied about 22% over the past month due to the news on China’s stimulus measures and the company’s solid September deliveries. However, LI stock is still down more than 32% year-to-date. Recently, Li Auto reported about a 49% rise in September deliveries to 53,709 vehicles. Overall, the company’s Q3 deliveries increased 45.4% to 152,831. The company attributed the robust performance to solid order intake for Li L series and Li MEGA.            ",

        "body": "The housing market is showing signs of life. Listing activity and homes going under contract ticked up last month nationwide, the latest sign that some of the paralysis brought on by the rapid jump in mortgage rates in recent years is easing. But there’s a limit to how far the housing market can rebound as homeowners with ultra-low mortgage rates stay put instead of listing their homes and accepting today’s rates of 6% or more, a phenomenon known as the rate lock-in effect. “Generally, new listings and sales moved closer to pre-pandemic norms in September,” said Kara Ng, a housing economist at Zillow. “That’s still a long way to go in terms of normalizing supply.” In September, the biggest gains came in pricy locales like Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Jose, Calif. Those regions have higher proportions of buyers who finance their purchases and jumbo mortgages that hand homebuyers bigger monthly cost savings when mortgage rates fall. In some markets, listing prices have even dropped slightly. About 950,000 homes were on the market nationwide in September. That number has been steadily rising this year, though it’s still about 22% below 2019 levels. New listings rose by 25% or more last month compared to a year earlier in the Seattle, Silicon Valley, Denver, and Washington, D.C., areas, according to Realtor.com. Median listing prices in all of those markets top $599,000. In expensive parts of the country, any mortgage rate savings can help spark buyer interest, said Tim Nguyen, a real estate agent in Santa Clara, Calif., where the median home lists for more than $1.4 million. Average interest rates this year dropped more than a percentage point from as high as 7.22% in May to closer to 6% last month. “That always drives the market,” Nguyen said. “If you look at a $1 million home, for every percentage point drop it’s a little over $500 of savings every month. That’s significant when you need money to buy groceries.” Read more: Is this a good time to buy a house? Pending sales, a measure of homes under contract, were up by double digits in Portland, Ore., Seattle, and several California cities in recent weeks, according to Redfin. But the signs of improvement come off of a very low base — a year ago, homebuying was muted because mortgage rates were close to 8% and measures of homes under contract have remained near record-low levels for years. Nationwide, Redfin calculated that pending sales rose 3.2% year over year for the four weeks through Oct. 13. It was the biggest jump in more than three years. Troy Khuu, a San Jose-based agent, said the most desirable homes in his market — ones that are updated, located in strong school districts, and close to tech companies — are still selling above their asking price, sometimes in a matter of days. But buyers aren’t rushing to buy homes that don’t meet all of their specifications, he said.        "

Stock-market performance is driven by profit growth, not political-landscape shifts, the bank said. Past policies have had unexpected impacts, highlighting the importance of sustainable profit growth. The outcome of the presidential election in November should have little impact on the direction of stock prices, Bank of America said. In a note on Friday, Savita Subramanian, a Bank of America strategist, said the stock market rarely cares about which political party controls the White House. Instead, investors' focus should be squarely on profit growth. \"Profits accelerating are far more important than who is sitting in the Oval Office,\" Subramanian said. Furthermore, targeted policies from lawmakers on Capitol Hill often have had the opposite impact on a sector than investors would have thought. For example, when Donald Trump took office in 2017, energy stocks were seen as a likely winner because of his friendly stance toward oil drilling, while renewable-energy stocks were seen as a likely loser. Instead, the energy sector was the worst-performing sector when Trump was in office, losing 29% even as the S&P 500 surged 83%. Meanwhile, the clean-energy sector rose 306% during Trump's presidency, according to data from YCharts. When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, many investors viewed the traditional energy sector as a likely loser because of the Democrats' typical unfriendliness toward oil companies, while clean-energy stocks were seen as likely winners. Today, the opposite is true: Traditional energy stocks have been the best-performing sector during Biden's presidency, rising 139%, while the clean-energy sector is the worst-performing sector, down about 55%. \"Even directed policies have sometimes had opposite outcomes vs expectations,\" Subramanian said, adding: \"There are nuances.\" This time around, Subramanian said investor expectations of stock-market implications based on who wins the presidency could once again fall flat. For example, while a Republican sweep of the White House and Congress may be viewed as favorable for Tesla stock, as CEO Elon Musk has warmly embraced Trump and the Republican Party, it could be a negative because electric-vehicle tax credits would likely be at risk. Ultimately, Subramanian and her team expect the stock market to rise in 2025 regardless of who wins the election in November. That's because she expects 13% year-over-year growth in the S&P 500's earnings per share next year, and profit growth has historically been the biggest driver of stock-market gains.   "

        "body": "Despite significant fluctuations in Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales, particularly in the Chinese and European markets, Japan’s BEV market has been stable without experiencing sharp increases or declines in BEV sales in recent years. In 2023, Passenger Car BEV sales in Japan increased by 50% to 89k units, accounting for 2.2% of all Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales. Although this volume is relatively small compared to the overall market size, with the share remaining around 1-2% of total PV sales, BEV sales in Japan have been gradually increasing since 2018, when they totalled 27k units and represented 0.6% of the market. The increase in BEV sales in 2022-23 can primarily be attributed to the launch of new Kei car BEVs, specifically the Nissan Sakura and Mitsubishi eK X EV. Nonetheless, certain factors discourage Japanese consumers from purchasing BEVs. Three key ones are high vehicle prices, concerns regarding battery durability, and range anxiety. Kei car BEVs can mitigate these disadvantages, increasing their sales over the past two years. One typical use for Kei cars is daily commuting within the city. They are not intended for long drives, but rather for trips to work, school, and daily shopping. For these purposes, Kei car BEVs are convenient. If users charge the battery at night, there is no need to refuel at public charging stations. However, two years after these Kei car BEVs launched, their sales have begun to stabilise. Recognising the potential of Kei car BEVs in the Japanese market, Japanese carmakers plan to introduce new models, starting with Commercial Kei BEVs. These models were initially scheduled for launch earlier this year, but their introduction has been postponed by several months due to the need for additional preparation time. Notably, Daihatsu faced challenges related to vehicle testing irregularities earlier this year, which limited their ability to allocate sufficient resources to new models, including Kei BEVs. Over the next few years, Japanese BEV sales will likely continue their slow growth. In the meantime, hybrid models remain popular. Sales of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) are also expected to grow gradually. It will be many years before we know which vehicle type will dominate the Japanese market. In April 2024, JAMA (the Japan Automotive Manufacturers Association) released a consumer survey concerning the PV market. JAMA conducts this survey bi-annually, the last report was released in 2022. The results confirm the BEV sales trend mentioned above. Regarding vehicle buyers’ purchasing intentions, the survey contains a question for current vehicle owners: Which vehicle type will be considered the first choice when buying your next vehicle?

They identify Big Money signals. The BMI is a 25-day moving average of those signals netted, with the ultimate output being a ratio of buys to sells. When the BMI is between 0% and 25%, selling is rampant. These rare periods don’t last long and tend to precede broad market rallies. It’s one of the most powerful risk-on signals you’ll find. At the other extreme, a BMI above 80% means we’ve entered a period of runaway buying. Periods like this can last longer – 22 days on average, but sometimes 80 days or more – and come before pullbacks. One year ago, extreme oversold conditions ignited a rally for the ages. Today, stocks are in the rare overbought zone. Stocks go from oversold to overbought – what a year! For those keeping score, both the S&P 500 (represented by the exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)) and Nasdaq 100 (represented by the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)) are both up 35% since. But now stocks are overbought. Since 2018, the BMI has produced seven oversold readings and 10 overbought readings: The BMI has gone from oversold (point seven above) to overbought for a second time (point 10 above) in a year. Again, the market rose 35% in that time. But what happens now? Once the BMI drops – and it will eventually – dips tend to occur: It’s simple: when the tide goes out, equity prices fall. In fact, large- and small-cap stocks (represented by the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR)) are negative on average up to two months after the BMI leaves overbought territory: The chart above will come in handy once the BMI signals the bid for stocks is fading. Keep it close so you can keep your mind focused on the long-term prize – painful drops are when opportunity arises! Congratulations if you stuck with stocks the past year. An extreme reading (oversold BMI) lit a monster rally. Now we’re in the overbought area. If you’re new to the MAPsignals process and missed out on the outstanding gains the last year, don’t fret.

        "body": "The exceptional stock market performance of the past ten years could be replaced by a decade of markedly lower returns, according to Goldman Sachs. During the next ten years, the S&P 500 (which reflects the broader market) could yield a nominal annualized return of 3%, analysts at the investment bank predicted in a note from Oct. 18. The analysts placed a negative 1% annualized nominal return at the low end of the range of likely outcomes, while a 7% return represented the upper bound. Yet, even the high end of the analysts’ range of estimates pales in comparison to the above-average 13% annualized total return the market has experienced during the last decade. “Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are towards the lower end of their typical performance distribution relative to bonds and inflation,” the analysts wrote in the note. The Goldman analysts also penciled in a 72% chance the S&P 500 will underperform bonds during the next decade, while they pegged the odds of the stock market index underperforming inflation at about a third. There’s also a 4% chance stocks post a negative absolute return over the period, the analysts wrote. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com Goldman’s lower stock market return outlook for the next decade was influenced in part by its estimate that the U.S. GDP will contract over four quarters during the next ten years, or about 10% of the time. Another factor is the volatility risk that comes from a market heavily dependent on a handful of stocks. The market cap of the 10 largest companies on the S&P 500 account for more than a third of the overall index, the analysts wrote. Their annualized return estimate would be several percentage points higher were they not to account for how highly concentrated the index is, the note read. “As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate,” the analysts wrote. Goldman’s lower returns forecast is below the consensus 6% average annualized return other market participants are expecting over the same period, and the analysts warned the estimate of many long-term investors like corporate and public pension plans are possibly too optimistic.

        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Tuesday, as a selloff in bonds pushed Treasury yields higher, pressuring rate-sensitive stocks, while investors awaited a deluge of corporate earnings for a clearer market direction. At 5:05 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were down 138 points, or 0.32%, U.S. S&P 500 E-minis were down 21.5 points, or 0.36%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 92.5 points, or 0.44%. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, as investors gauged the impact of the upcoming presidential election on fiscal policy, while reassessing the effect of a robust American economy on the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory. [MKTS/GLOB] The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose as high as 4.222%, continuing a steady climb higher since early October, after a bumper jobs report led investors to dial back expectations for monetary policy easing through the year. Traders are pricing in an 89% chance of a 25-basis-point interest-rate cut in November, according to CME's FedWatch. Rate-sensitive megacap stocks slipped in premarket trading, with Tesla down 0.7%, Apple falling 0.3% and Nvidia losing 0.5%. The primary focus, however, remained on corporate earnings, with more than 100 companies set to report this week. General Motors, 3M and Verizon are among those scheduled to report before the bell, while Baker Hughes and Texas Instruments are awaited after market close. BCA Research analysts said they expected third-quarter earnings to be strong enough to support hopes for a soft landing for the economy. \"Earnings season will also provide useful information on the US economy and consumer spending, the global growth slowdown, and the breadth of earnings growth outside of the mega-cap names.\" Stocks retreated from record highs on Monday, as investors took a breather following six consecutive weeks of advances for major indexes, although gains in Nvidia helped the Nasdaq edge higher. While indexes have rallied on the back of upbeat data and a favorable monetary policy outlook, the next few weeks are likely to be a volatile ride for equity markets, as investors assess earnings, fresh economic data and the results of the U.S. election in two weeks, followed by a central bank meeting. Estimated third-quarter year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 is 6.5% excluding the Energy sector and 4% overall, according to LSEG data. Futures tracking the economically sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.6%. Remarks from Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker are expected later in the day.

        "body": "By Alexander Marrow (Reuters) -Amsterdam-based Nebius Group closed 5.6% higher on Monday, recovering from huge early losses when trading for the first time since February 2022, as the AI infrastructure firm's Nasdaq listing, formerly held by Yandex, often dubbed \"Russia's Google\", went live. Trading was suspended soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the stock traded under Yandex's ticker through its Amsterdam-based parent company. In July, Nebius emerged following a $5.4 billion deal to split Yandex's Russian and international assets. The stock, which had last traded at $18.94 per share in February 2022, slumped 26% in pre-market trading, but recovered all losses to gain 5.6% on the day and close at $20 per share. Yandex once reached a market capitalisation of more than $30 billion, but with revenue-generating businesses in online search, advertising and ride-hailing siphoned off in Russia, Nebius, which targets a slice of the growing AI cloud market, presents a very different proposition. With a free float of 78.1%, mainly held by Western investors and funds, extremely high volatility is likely in the first few days, said Denis Buivolov, a personal investor in Nebius and head of research at BCS' venture capital and pre-IPO department. In an analysis published on financial website Seeking Alpha, Buivolov valued the company at $4.6 billion, or $23 per share, based on company plans and comparisons with firms such as CoreWeave, Lambda Labs and Sacra. Dr Jan-Oliver Strych, adviser to his family fund which invested in Nebius, said the stock's value would be determined by the positive liquidity shock from hyped AI investor demand versus the negative impact of impatient sellers. Nebius, whose core business involves providing Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI cloud as services, is anticipating sharp growth in those markets in coming years. The company expects its revenue to grow by three to four times in 2025 to $500-$700 million, it said on Friday, as it plans to spend between $600 million and $1.5 billion on capital expenditure to increase capacity at data centres in Finland, France and North America.

Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes Waaree Energies Ltd. is valued at $5 billion at the upper end of its price range of 1,427 rupees to 1,503 rupees. Its shares, which have attracted investments from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., and Morgan Stanley, will start trading next week. The IPO drew strong demand from small and wealthy investors, with the 21.1 million shares on sale getting oversubscribed little over two times as of 2:12 p.m. in Mumbai. This underlines the frenzy for new issuances in a country that’s been a global hotspot for dealmaking in recent months. The backing by prominent Wall Street names underscores the appeal of India’s renewable sector, where stocks have rallied as much as 357% this year. Six of the top 10 best performers on Bloomberg’s World Energy index are Indian firms, including the gauge’s top performer. “Renewables is a large opportunity in India for the next three years,” said Ramesh Mantri, chief investment officer for equities at WhiteOak Capital Asset Management Ltd. The public offering aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal to boost renewable energy production to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade — a more than two-fold increase from now. The sector may need investments of $2.2 trillion by 2050, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. Still, there are challenges. This space has been struggling with high leverage due to its rapid growth rate and weak cash flows, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report. Meanwhile, the country is still boosting investments in thermal power projects to meet its booming energy demands. That hasn’t stopped the company’s shares from fetching a premium of 1,480-1,510 rupees over the price band in the country’s gray market, according to brokers aware of the deals, who didn’t want to be identified as the information is private. In the unregulated gray market trading, investors enter into informal contracts to trade shares at a pre-determined price before their actual debut. “With solar energy emerging as a key global theme in the transition to renewable energy, Waaree Energy is best placed to capitalize on the growing opportunity,” Shiwani Kumari, an analyst at Monarch Networth Capital, said in a recent note.

        "body": "Tesla (TSLA) has underperformed over the past few weeks following a disappointing production report and negative market reactions to its long-awaited Robotaxi event. As the company prepares to report its Q3 earnings results next week, I maintain a Hold stance on TSLA. I believe that as the market’s attention increasingly shifts to the bottom line, the company’s margins are likely to come under pressure in Q3 due to ongoing headwinds in the auto industry. This could lead to a negative reaction, although some surprises may emerge, such as regulatory credits and strong growth in its energy storage business. Tesla is scheduled to report its Q3 earnings on October 23. However, part of my neutral stance ahead of the earnings release stems from the fact that Tesla’s earnings day often feels less impactful. The company provides its production and delivery results before its financial reports, giving investors a significant preview of its performance. In early October, the company reported 462,890 deliveries, a 6% increase compared to the same period last year but slightly below analysts’ expectations of 463,310. However, I believe this discrepancy is part of a short- to medium-term trend that investors have come to anticipate. The reasons for not meeting expectations can be attributed to significant macroeconomic pressures, particularly the high interest rate environment, which has affected car sales on financing options—a situation that has only recently started to improve. The auto industry as a whole has faced challenges, with weak sales reports from traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). However, there is more to consider. Tesla’s broader strategic shift towards autonomous ride-hailing and humanoid robots may also be impacting production. Such a significant change in strategy is likely to result in periods of contraction in its traditional electric vehicle deliveries and production numbers. While I view Tesla’s current situation as cautious, one major area where the company seems to hold significant long-term potential is in its AI initiatives, particularly its shift toward autonomous ride-hailing and humanoid robots. The long-awaited Robotaxi event, which had been rescheduled several times, finally took place on October 10. Although I see the event as a pivotal moment for the company’s next stage of growth, the market’s reaction was less favorable, likely due to a lack of detailed information. During the event, Musk announced that the company would begin manufacturing Cybercabs before 2027, but he also acknowledged his tendency to be overly optimistic about timelines.              ",

Gas and liquid handling companies possess the technical know-how and specialized equipment to handle valuable (and sometimes dangerous) substances. Lately, water conservation and carbon capture–which requires hydrogen and other gasses as well as specialized infrastructure–have been trending up, creating new demand for products such as filters, pumps, and valves. On the other hand, gas and liquid handling companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies’ offerings. The 12 gas and liquid handling stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9%. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. In light of this news, gas and liquid handling stocks have held steady with share prices up 3.9% on average since the latest earnings results. Powering fluid dynamics since 1934, Gorman-Rupp (NYSE:GRC) has evolved from its Ohio origins into a global manufacturer and seller of pumps and pump systems. Gorman-Rupp reported revenues of $169.5 million, flat year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 3.8%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. Scott A. King, President and CEO commented, “Incoming orders have continued at a solid pace and on a year-to-date basis are up over 6% compared to the first half of last year, resulting in an increase in backlog since the end of 2023. In addition, our pricing strategies contributed to improved gross margin and increased adjusted earnings. We are focused on top line growth through backlog reduction in the second half of the year, as well as delivering strong gross margin and earnings. We are also pleased that our previously announced refinancing is expected to result in significant interest savings going forward.”                     ",

These suppliers all offer shorter-term contracts and unlike Qatar do not restrict the cargoes' final destination. This gives buyers flexibility to sell cargoes elsewhere in the future if they no longer need the cargoes. Negotiations between Japanese and South Korean buyers and Qatar have stalled over Qatar's insistence on destination clauses, the sources said. \"The Qataris try to achieve a lot in how they sell their LNG, in terms of retaining control over the market, whereas (others such as) the UAE's ADNOC and Oman are kind of happy to just get a good price,\" a senior trading source said. \"ADNOC has taken advantage of the current situation, which is that people want diversification of supply,\" the source added. If state-owned QatarEnergy (QE) does not sign new agreements with Japan and South Korea - the world's second and third largest LNG importers after China - Qatar's role would be further diminished. It was knocked off the top spot as global LNG supplier by the United States in 2023. Qatar's major 4.92 million tons-per-year deal to supply Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) expires this year. Another 2.1 mtpa supply deal expires in 2026, official data showed. QatarEnergy said it does not comment on market speculation. Japan's LNG demand is falling due to nuclear reactor restarts, more renewable energy and a slowing economy. Imports fell to 66 million metric tons in 2023, from 83 tons in 2018, Japan customs data shows. Qatar's market share in Japan fell to 4% in 2023 from 12% in 2018. Meanwhile, the United States' share in Japan rose to 8% from 3% during the same period. Qatar's share of South Korea's market fell to 19% in 2023 from 32% in 2018, with Australia's share rising to 24% from 19% and Malaysia's growing to 13% from 8% in the same period, data from consultancy Energy Aspects showed. TOUGH TALKS QatarEnergy is working to sign deals to supply European and Asian buyers with fresh supplies of LNG expected to come onstream from its North Field expansion, which will boost its overall production by 85%.

        "body": "As the Q2 earnings season wraps, let’s dig into this quarter’s best and worst performers in the leisure facilities industry, including Xponential Fitness (NYSE:XPOF) and its peers. Leisure facilities companies often sell experiences rather than tangible products, and in the last decade-plus, consumers have slowly shifted their spending from \"things\" to \"experiences\". Leisure facilities seek to benefit but must innovate to do so because of the industry's high competition and capital intensity. The 12 leisure facilities stocks we track reported a strong Q2. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 13.8% below. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. In light of this news, leisure facilities stocks have held steady with share prices up 4.5% on average since the latest earnings results. Owner of CycleBar, Rumble, and Club Pilates, Xponential Fitness (NYSE:XPOF) is a boutique fitness brand offering diverse and specialized exercise experiences. Xponential Fitness reported revenues of $76.52 million, down 1.1% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 8.5%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. “During my first six weeks, I’ve enjoyed the opportunity to meet with many of our dedicated franchisees and employees,” said Mark King, CEO of Xponential Fitness, Xponential Fitness delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 24.8% since reporting and currently trades at $12.80. Read our full report on Xponential Fitness here, it’s free. With over 150 locations and gyms that include saunas and steam rooms, Life Time (NYSE:LTH) is an upscale fitness club emphasizing holistic well-being and fitness. Life Time reported revenues of $667.8 million, up 18.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 5.2%. The business had a stunning quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ same-store sales estimates.                 ",

Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says The S&P 500 Index (^GSPC) will approach 6,000 by year-end — a record milestone 2.3% above Friday’s close — based on the median estimate from 411 questionnaire participants. Three quarters of respondents expect this earnings season to give the benchmark a boost, and the strength of Corporate America’s results are seen as more crucial for the stock market’s performance than who wins the November vote or even the Federal Reserve’s policy path. US stocks face a big earnings hurdle this week, with roughly 20% of S&P 500 members scheduled to release results, including heavyweights Tesla Inc (TSLA). and IBM (IBM). About 70 companies in the gauge have reported already, with 76% announcing earnings that surpassed estimates, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. After Tesla, the other so-called Magnificent Seven members report starting later this month. Those technology behemoths — Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META) — have driven the brunt of the equities advance since last year. But they trailed last quarter as the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since 2020, supporting sectors like financials and utilities. Survey takers anticipate the tech giants will take the lead again. A combined 75% expect the Magnificent Seven to either beat or perform in line with the rest of the market this quarter, after the group started October with a 0.9% decline. One reason investors remain bullish is that the bulk of the S&P 500’s earnings growth still comes from the Magnificent Seven. “The catch-up in the Magnificent Seven after a lackluster quarter is a compelling trade to look at right now,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital. The median survey respondent sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 5,977, up from Friday’s close of about 5,865. That would extend the index’s 23% gain in 2024, which has taken it to 47 record closing highs, including two last week.                ",

        "body": "A former owner of a pet shop and mahjong parlors in Japan has invested his way to eight figures — and earned the nickname Japan’s Warren Buffett. At 88, Shigeru Fujimoto of Kobe is photographed clad in unassuming pullovers while he sits before three computer monitors. But don’t be fooled. This octogenarian, much like the Oracle of Omaha, has invested for decades: since age 19, according to The Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper. He became a full-time investor in 1986 and a day-trader in 2015. He is famously frugal, too. Just as Buffett drives a 10-year-old Cadillac XTS, Fujimoto gets by without a cellphone or car. “My goal is Warren Buffett,” Fujimoto told the outlet. With a net worth of $14 million, per Bloomberg, he still has a very, very long way to go, given that Buffett’s net worth is an estimated $143.2 billion as of early October. Yet you can’t help but notice similarities. Buffett is 94, just six years Fujimoto’s senior. Both still keep to ambitious work regiments; Fujimoto begins his \"workday\" at 2 a.m.. And when he speaks, Japanese markets listen. After a regulatory filing revealed he had a stake of more than 5% built up in Storage-Oh Co., which manages storage units, its shares spiked 17%. Fujimoto stands out in a country where cash savings made up more than half of household assets in the second quarter of this year, which is attributed to the deflationary environment. That's over 1 quadrillion yen (15 zeroes) or roughly $7 trillion, according to the Bank of Japan. “It’s no use just remaining cautious and thinking to yourself, ‘Oh, that looks fine,’” Fujimoto said to The Asahim Shimbun, talking about the first time he was introduced to online day trading. “Zero times zero only makes zero. Your world is so small. There are so many things that you don’t know. Age doesn’t matter when you are making a new effort.” In declining health according to Japanese media, there’s a clear desire to learn his secrets before he passes away. A book of his teachings is labeled a bestseller on Amazon Japan. Meanwhile, he remains eager to keep trading, telling The Asahi Shimbun: “I will be retiring when I die.” Fujimoto has earned enough to retire multiple times. If he spent $3800 a day – enough to land a first-class flight, a five-star hotel and chump change for Kobe steaks – it would last him 10 years. He keeps score a different way. He rates his life “a 75 out of 100,” adding: ”I will go on pursuing the perfection of spirit, techniques and physical fitness, and my life may improve to 90 or 100 points.”       "

As always, the key is identifying stocks poised to deliver solid returns, and Bank of America has highlighted strong choices for those seeking high-growth opportunities. BofA’s analysts aren’t limiting their focus to just one part of the market; they are looking across sectors at a diverse group of stocks – and they are looking ‘under the hood’ to find shares that are ready to jump. With that in mind, we turned to the TipRanks database to review two of Bank of America’s latest stock picks, both of which present strong upside — including one with a potential gain of nearly 390%. In fact, the banking giant isn’t the only one backing these names; both stocks are rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the broader analyst consensus. Let’s take a closer look and find out what the optimism is all about. Werewolf Therapeutics (HOWL) We’ll begin in the world of biotherapeutics, where Werewolf Therapeutics is developing new immunotherapy drugs specifically designed to reduce the common and severe side effects often associated with cancer treatment. The company has created a proprietary development platform, known as PREDATOR, to engineer conditionally activated molecules that stimulate both the adaptive and innate functions of the immune system. With this approach, Werewolf has successfully advanced two drug candidates into clinical trials. Both products are INDUKINE molecules, a proprietary development, and are designed to selectively activate in tumor tissues while remaining inactive in peripheral tissues, a feature intended to reduce the occurrence of unwanted off-target effects while maximizing the anti-tumor immune response. Werewolf’s goal is to create anti-cancer drugs with higher tolerability levels than existing treatments. Werewolf’s lead drug candidate, WTX-124, is being developed to treat solid tumors and is under investigation as both a monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda. The company is enrolling patients in a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter study – a first-in-human trial of the drug. At the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2024, the company shared new interim results from the monotherapy dose-escalation arm, along with early data from the combination arm. The latest data highlighted WTX-124’s clinical activity and its overall tolerability in patients. Dose escalation in the combination study section is ongoing, with updated data expected by year-end. The company’s second candidate, WTX-330, is focused on treating advanced or metastatic solid tumors as a monotherapy. Early data from its Phase 1 trial, also presented at ASCO, showed promising outcomes in patients with advanced solid tumors or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Werewolf plans to release further updates later in this quarter.                ",

The Israeli military is continuing its attacks against Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, with hundreds of Beirut residents fleeing their homes late on Sunday as explosions rocked the Lebanese capital. Gold prices surged to a record high on Monday and were little changed at $2,719.33 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.3% higher at $2,738.9. The benchmark S&P 500 and Dow finished lower, with defensive stocks including real estate and healthcare among the leading drags. The Nasdaq closed slightly stronger, with Nvidia finishing at a record high, ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.80%, to 42,931.60, the S&P 500 fell 0.18% to 5,853.98 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.27% to 18,540.01. The European shares index lost 0.66%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.37%. Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.5% lower. \"There's just tension around the earning season kicking off in earnest and then, of course, the elections two weeks away even though we haven't had the typical anxiety over elections that we normally see in September and October,\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California. Oil prices settled up nearly 2% after a more than 7% drop last week. Brent crude futures settled up 1.68% at $74.29 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were 1.94% higher at $70.56 a barrel. Markets are pricing in a 89.3% chance for a cut of 25 basis points (bps) at the Fed's November meeting, with an 10.7% chance of the central bank holding rates steady, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 11.9 basis points to 4.194%. The dollar climbed, buoyed by a rise in U.S. bond yields. The euro was down 0.46% at $1.0815, while the pound weakened 0.51% to $1.2982. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.86% to 150.79. The European Central Bank (ECB) last week cut rates for the third time this year. Data on Monday showed German producer prices fell more than expected in September. The dollar index, which tracks its performance against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro,rose 0.49% to 103.97. \"Between the combination of escalating or still-high Middle East tensions, and we're only a handful of days away from the (U.S. election), it could be that the market is getting nervous ahead of that and people are squaring some of their positions,\" said Wasif Latif, president and chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners.

        "body": "Stocks can climb 13%-14% to climb in 2025, UBS said. The bank is adding to the growing numbers of forecasts for a \"no landing\" of the US economy. Inflation will remain low enough to leave room for the Fed to cut interest rates, boosting stocks. The stock market is on track for another year of double-digit gains, according to UBS. Strategists at the bank made a bullish call for stocks in a note on Friday, predicting the S&P 500 would reach 6,600 by the end of next year. That forecast implies around 13% upside from the benchmark index's current levels, and the rise will be fueled by a \"no landing\" for the economy, the firm said. In that scenario, economic growth continues, the job market remains strong, while inflation and interest rates might remain slightly higher than markets had previously expected under a hard landing or a soft landing scenario. \"[T]he bottom line is that the improved US macroeconomic outlook increases our degree of certainty about our positive view of equities. We have upgraded US equities to Attractive from neutral,\" strategists said in a note on Friday, pointing to data that suggested the economy was on a solid bedrock. The job market is proving resilient, despite tighter financial conditions and higher interest rates. The US added 254,000 jobs in September, way more than the expected 147,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The jobless rate, meanwhile, remained near historic lows, with unemployment dipping to 4.1%. Economic activity also remains robust. Retail sales grew an above-expected 0.4% over the month of September, and GDP expanded 3% year-over-year in the second quarter. Inflation, meanwhile, is moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. Consumer prices grew 2.4% annually in September, while personal consumption expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, grew 2.2% year-over-year in August, its lowest reading since 2021. Cooling price growth sets the stage for the Fed to continue cutting interest rates, UBS said, which is bullish for stocks. Markets are pricing in a 72% chance the Fed will cut rates another 50 basis points by the end of year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. The strategists added that while investors may see some volatility ahead of the November election, it's unlikely to interrupt more positive market catalysts. \"The US presidential election is unlikely to derail positive fundamentals. We expect volatility to rise in the runup to the election as neither party holds a clear advantage in any of the key swing states that will decide the outcome. But the election is taking place against a backdrop of Fed rate cuts, US economic momentum, and supportive secular trends like artificial intelligence (AI),\" the note added.   "

        "body": "Nvidia has been one of the most hyped and closely followed stocks in recent memory as the fortunes of the broader market increasingly hinge on the AI chip leader. At one point this year, the stock accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500's gains, and some investors even held watch parties for Nvidia's earnings release. Nvidia's astronomical run to a $3 trillion company has also been somewhat divisive as many on Wall Street have doubted that the stock can sustain further gains while others see the AI boom fueling more upside. That's left investors asking, \"Should I buy Nvidia stock right now, or sell it?\" Analysts at Bank of America have an answer: In a note on Thursday, they reiterated their buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised their price target to $190 from $165, implying it could soar 38% higher from Friday's closing price. At $190 a share, Nvidia's market cap would also explode to $4.7 trillion, from $3.4 trillion today. In fact, BofA is so bullish on Nvidia stock that analysts called it a \"generational opportunity,\" estimating a total addressable market of more than $400 billion for AI accelerators. \"AI models (demand) continue to evolve, with the cadence of new LLM model launches now increased to 3-5 times/yr per developer (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.), and each new major generation requiring 10-20x compute requirement to train,\" analysts said. Their confidence in Nvidia has been boosted by others in the chip sector like Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML, which both recently signaled strong AI demand. BofA's meetings with executives at Broadcom and Micron as well as comments from AMD have yielded similar indications. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also touted huge demand for the company's next-generation AI chip. “Blackwell is in full production. Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane,” he told CNBC earlier this month. “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.” Adding to BofA's bullish case for Nvidia is its underappreciated enterprise partnerships with the likes of Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft, and others as well as its software products that help reinforce Nvidia's dominance in hardware. They combine to create a deeper overall Nvidia ecosystem for AI. Plus, Nvidia could generate more than $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, rivaling even Apple, BofA estimated. Earnings reports later this month from tech giants that are developing AI technologies, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, should provide more insight into demand. And Nvidia is due to report Nov. 20.    ",

The yield on 10-year Treasuries added one basis point to 4.21% after an 11 basis-point surge at the start of the week. Investors are paring back their expectations for Fed rate cuts after central bank officials indicated a preference for reducing rates at a slower pace. The inflationary impact of a possible Donald Trump presidential win is also weighing, given his promised tax cuts and trade tariffs could ultimately entail higher rates. “This is very clearly linked to trading a victory of the Republicans — and therefore to an agenda which would be much more inflationist than that of the Democrats. We’re in a market that is betting on Trump,” said Christopher Dembik, senior investment adviser at Pictet Asset Management. “The rise in yields is starting to threaten equity markets.” Bonds Are Selling Off Everywhere as Traders Rethink Fed Pathway Gold rose — approaching Monday’s record high — with haven demand coming from traders focused on the conflict in the Middle East and the looming US vote. Despite the mounting risks, the current winning streak for US stocks ranks among the very best since 1928, according to data compiled by SentimenTrader. Should the S&P close with a loss on Tuesday, it would be the first back-to-back decline in about 30 sessions. According to Citigroup Inc. strategists, exposure to the S&P 500 has reached levels that were followed by a 10% slump in the past. Tough Call Even though US equities are expensive, going underweight is a tough call for investors in the environment where S&P 500 reached 47 record highs this year starting from January, said Vera Fehling, DWS Europe chief investment officer. “If you said then: ‘things are looking quite stretched’ — you would have massively underperformed,” she added. “It’s difficult to explain going into the end of such a year with a significant underweight in US equities.” European equities appear cheap by comparison. So far about 47% of MSCI Europe companies reported results below expectations while only 27% delivered beats, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

        "body": "Buy the dip. That was the mindset around chip stocks last week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia (NVDA) to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries. Nvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. The stock was trading a touch higher, up 0.2%, in Monday's premarket trading. It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple (AAPL). But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. “There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts (video above). “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.” Even amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first. In the coming weeks, earnings from fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI. Last quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half. BofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia \"strengthening its position.\" Arya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 last week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price. Arya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.

But the country is still relatively new to the sort of funding that many observers associate with the term, with recent growth in involvement of local and global funds focused specifically on strategies including direct lending, special situations and mezzanine finance. Local firms are fueling competition with global giants such Cerberus and Oaktree Capital Management. India’s direct-lending market has yet to come through a full credit cycle and troubles at some players may eventually result in consolidation, according to Cerberus’s Ghosh. For now, India’s central bank chief is relatively sanguine about the outlook for the sector, though he expressed concern from a global perspective. “At the moment, we don’t see the kind of risk which we see at a global scale” for private credit in India, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said at the forum. At the global level, the “robustness and resilience of private credit is yet to be tested” and “every central bank or every regulator should be looking into” the possible risks, he said. The global private credit industry has more than doubled in size to a $1.7 trillion since 2019. The opaque nature of the market is attracting greater scrutiny from regulators, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England as higher borrowing costs weigh on weaker borrowers and trigger more bad loans. Current private debt returns fail to justify the growing risk in private credit, according to Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Mohit Mittal, chief investment officer for core strategies, who was speaking in a Bloomberg Intelligence Podcast. He warned of “more complacency” in private credit.           "

        "body": "As the Q2 earnings season comes to a close, it’s time to take stock of this quarter’s best and worst performers in the home furniture retailer industry, including Arhaus (NASDAQ:ARHS) and its peers. Furniture retailers understand that ‘home is where the heart is’ but that no home is complete without that comfy sofa to kick back on or a dreamy bed to rest in. These stores focus on providing not only what is practically needed in a house but also aesthetics, style, and charm in the form of tables, lamps, and mirrors. Decades ago, it was thought that furniture would resist e-commerce because of the logistical challenges of shipping large furniture, but now you can buy a mattress online and get it in a box a few days later; so just like other retailers, furniture stores need to adapt to new realities and consumer behaviors. The 4 home furniture retailer stocks we track reported a strong Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 7.2% below. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal recently, leading the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent or 0.5%) in September 2024. This is the first cut in four years. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be debating whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Thankfully, home furniture retailer stocks have been resilient with share prices up 8.9% on average since the latest earnings results. With an aesthetic that features natural materials such as reclaimed wood, Arhaus (NASDAQ:ARHS) is a high-end furniture retailer that sells everything from sofas to rugs to bookcases. Arhaus reported revenues of $309.8 million, flat year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 1.4%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings estimates but a miss of analysts’ gross margin estimates. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 32.7% since reporting and currently trades at $9.32. Is now the time to buy Arhaus? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.

Block’s comments come amid renewed investor optimism toward the cohort of the top technology names — Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. — after a lackluster quarter when the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cut spurred a rotation into other sectors. The S&P 500 just capped a sixth straight week of gains thanks to a slew of solid corporate earnings and signs the world’s largest economy is holding up. The US benchmark gauge has notched 47 closing records this year, with nearly one third of its constituents notching 52-week highs last week. “As long as the labor market is reasonably strong in the US — which it is — you’re not going to see outflows,” he said. “You’re just going to continue to see inflows, especially in those most heavily weighted names in the S&P 500.” Meanwhile, Block reiterated his aversion toward China, a market he has been calling “uninvestable.” A long-time China skeptic and one of the most famous short sellers when it comes to the Asian nation’s stocks, he has instead preferred investing in Vietnam, where Muddy Waters has launched a long-only fund. Despite a recent rally spurred by Beijing’s stimulus blitz, Block said the issues of corporate governance, policy “capriciousness” and geopolitical issues remain big hurdles. “From a medium to long term perspective, I once again just still fail to see how having money committed to China makes sense,” Block said, adding that he doesn’t have an opinion on China on a short-term basis.

That’s not what the industry wants you to think Housing market report: 10 states where home prices have risen more than 600% since 1984 Over the past 40 years, U.S. home prices as tracked by the Freddie Mac House Price Index, have soared a staggering 494%. The 10 states with the biggest home price gains between March 1984 and March 2024 were Washington (828%), Oregon (699%), Rhode Island (668%), Massachusetts (664%), California (664%), Hawaii (639%), Utah (610%), Montana (608%), Idaho (607%), Maine (605%). During that 40-year span, overall inflation rose 203%, while median U.S. household incomes rose 233%. Despite the significant disparity between national home price growth and inflation/median incomes, housing affordability is a different story. Traditional housing affordability measurements—taking into account mortgage rates, median incomes, and national home prices—show that in 2024, the situation is only marginally worse than it was for national housing affordability in 1984. This is especially true for buyers who are financing their housing market purchases (although, those who could afford to pay all-cash in 1984 had a considerable advantage over all-cash buyers in 2024). The reason that 1984 and 2024 housing affordability are closer than incomes and prices alone suggest? Mortgage rates. In 1984, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was between 13.0% to 15.0%, whereas in 2024, it hovers around 7.0%. Of course, if you consider other factors like property taxes, home insurance, and down payment size, that could make 2024 housing affordability a little worse than traditional affordability metrics suggest. It's important to note that state-level home prices did not rise upward in a perfectly straight line over the past four decades; there were bumps along the way. And just because national home prices have soared by 494% over the past 40 years doesn’t mean the next 40 years will look the same.

Outside the U.S., diverging reports from chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and chipmaking equipment supplier ASML Holding moved shares in opposite directions while investors await semiconductor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia to unveil their earnings as they seek a trend. Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage unit, which provides services for hedge funds and tracks their positioning, said portfolio managers net bought U.S. information technology stocks for the third straight week. Hedge funds both covered short positions - bets stocks will fall - and snapped up long positions. The bank said the only information tech subsector hedge funds sold was software. Overall, information technology accounts for 16.1% of hedge funds' U.S. exposure, down from roughly 22% it reached earlier this year. On the flip side, hedge funds sold stocks in U.S. consumer sectors, from food products to beverages and restaurants for the fifth straight week, the bank said.

        "body": "The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how electrical systems stocks fared in Q2, starting with Atkore (NYSE:ATKR). Like many equipment and component manufacturers, electrical systems companies are buoyed by secular trends such as connectivity and industrial automation. More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products. The 14 electrical systems stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Luckily, electrical systems stocks have performed well with share prices up 10.9% on average since the latest earnings results. Protecting the things that power our world, Atkore (NYSE:ATKR) designs and manufactures electrical safety products. Atkore reported revenues of $822.4 million, down 10.5% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with underwhelming EBITDA guidance for the full year and a miss of analysts’ operating margin estimates. “Atkore delivered Adjusted EBITDA margins over 25% on essentially flat volume compared to the prior year,” said Bill Waltz, Atkore President and Chief Executive Officer. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 24.8% since reporting and currently trades at $89.03. Read our full report on Atkore here, it’s free. Originally a metal-working shop supporting local petrochemical facilities, Powell (NYSE:POWL) has grown from a small Houston manufacturer to a global provider of electrical systems.

The S&P 500 has risen in 39 of the past 50 years, generating an average annual return of 11.9%, including dividends. 🐂 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 🐻 So, if history repeats itself, stocks should do well for whoever wins the presidency. To be sure, the market has done better with Democratic presidents than Republican ones. According to Ned Davis Research, from 1901 to 2024, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed an annualized 8.2% under Democratic presidents and 3.2% under Republican administrations. Perhaps that means Democratic presidents have implemented superior economic policy compared to Republicans. But it seems likely to me that much of the difference is random. The makeup of Congress shows the opposite result. With a Democratic-controlled Congress, the DJIA has gained an annualized 1.1% when adjusted for inflation. However, with a Republican Congress, the increase is 6.5%. Again, I think the results are more random than a reflection of the superior economic policy passed by GOP-led Congresses. Looking at the current market environment, some experts say a Trump victory has already been priced into the strong stock market. They think he would implement business-friendly policies that are good for stocks. Related: Major Wall Street firm lays out extreme possibility for S&P 500 in 2025 The betting odds of Trump becoming president have risen to 56%, according to data from several sources cited by JPMorgan Chase. Meanwhile, the odds of a GOP majority in the Senate have risen above 80%, and the odds of a Democratic House have slid from over 60% to around 55%. “The rising probability of a Republican sweep is seen in the market moves over the past two weeks,” Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director for global market strategy at JPMorgan, wrote in a commentary. Those moves include stronger stocks, particularly bank stocks, a stronger dollar, and higher U.S. bond yields. But market levels don’t imply as high a probability of a Republican presidency/Congress sweep as the 45% probability implied by betting markets, he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 344.31 points, or 0.80%, to 42,931.60, the S&P 500 lost 10.69 points, or 0.18%, to 5,853.98. The Nasdaq Composite gained 50.45 points, or 0.27%, to 18,540.01, boosted by the chip heavyweight Nvidia, which rose 4.14% to close at a record high of $143.71. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury jumped as high as 4.17%, a 12-week high. \"The rise in the 10-year yield is causing confusion that maybe the economy is growing too rapidly and that employment remains too resilient,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"As a result, the Fed might end up being slower to lower interest rates.\" On Friday, the Dow and the S&P 500 both closed at record highs as all three major indexes posted a sixth consecutive week of gains, their longest winning streak this year. Many rate-sensitive megacap technology stocks slipped. Tesla was down 0.84%. After a fairly upbeat start to earnings season, the focus was on the 114 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week. These include Tesla, Coca-Cola and Texas Instruments. Ahead of a busy week for earnings, some investors likely took some profits, according to analysts. David Laut, chief investment officer at Abound Financial, said the market was looking at how stretched valuations are. Of companies that have reported so far, 83.1% beat earnings estimates, according to data compiled by LSEG on Friday. Monday's declines were broad, with almost all 11 major S&P 500 sectors in the red. The rate-sensitive Real Estate sector dropped 2.08% as yields rose, while the technology sector was lifted by the jump in Nvidia. The economically sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 1.61%. Investors also looked ahead to the U.S. presidential election, with polls showing chances improving for former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate.

As of June 30, 2024, the company operated 50 pharmacies that served approximately 174,000 residents in approximately 6,700 LTCFs across 36 states. Guardian Pharmacy Services priced its initial public offering of 8 million shares at $14.00 per share. The company started trading on September 26. Truist notes the sizable market opportunity of around $24.8 billion of U.S. institutional pharmacy revenue in 2024. The analyst observes strong industry trends driven by the aging U.S. population and an increase in residents at assisted living facilities, along with a rise in chronic conditions and multiple diagnoses. “Given these industry dynamics, we view Guardian as well positioned given their differentiated scale, suite of capabilities,” Truist analyst writes. The analyst sees a market share of over 12%, with a leading presence in many regions and an impressive assisted living resident adoption rate of approximately 88%. The analyst adds that Guardian has strategically targeted the more lucrative markets of assisted living and behavioral health facilities/group homes. The analyst initiates with a Buy rating and a price target of $22. Truist says the industry dynamics are advantageous, as the market is notably fragmented, and regulatory requirements create significant barriers to entry. Additionally, demographic trends are likely to provide a boost, particularly as the aging population increasingly relies on prescription medications. Stable margins have accompanied Guardian’s rapid membership growth, and the company’s strong cash flow and appealing financial flexibility will enable continued investments in growth and M&A, the analyst says. Lastly, Truist foresees ongoing expansion efforts in new and established markets via organically and M&A activities. Price Action: GRDN stock is down 1.13% at $17.48 at last check Monday.

        "body": "By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Investors are leaving exchange-traded funds tied to specific themes, such as artificial intelligence and video gaming, as they flock to funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks that are hitting record highs. The run for the exits, however, may slow if the broader market stumbles. While flows in equity ETFs overall continue to climb, thematic ETFs, which invest in companies tied to everything from solar energy to robotics and millennial consumers, are on pace for their third-consecutive year of net outflows, according to financial data and analysis company Morningstar. The category, which has total assets of $108 billion, has lost $5.8 billion in investor capital this year, greater outflows than the $4.8 billion for all of 2023, according to Morningstar. \"It's winter for thematic ETFs right now,\" said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs, an asset-management firm focused on this category. Returns from broad market indexes are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. The S&P 500, the benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has climbed over 22% this year, propelled by gains from influential stocks including Nvidia and Meta Platforms. The five-largest ETFs tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, another equity benchmark, have seen inflows of $170 billion this year. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust on Thursday became the first ETF to reach $600 billion in assets. \"It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out,\" said Aniket Ullal, ETF analyst at CFRA, a market-research firm. BAD TIMING Part of the challenge, said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar, is the nature of thematic investing itself. Investors often mistime investing in themes, according to a Morningstar study that found investors in thematic ETFs missed out on two-thirds of their returns in a five-year period. \"You have to pick the right theme, then be sure that the fund has picked the stocks that will benefit most from that theme, and then be right about the timing of when you buy the fund,\" Armour said. \"Getting that trifecta right is tough.\" Even some AI-themed ETFs with outsized exposure to market-darling Nvidia have struggled to retain assets. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF has seen net outflows of $89 million in the last 12 months, according to the firm. Despite the fund having nearly 13% of its portfolio in the AI chipmaker - almost double the S&P 500 weighting - it has performed only in line with the index, with both up about 39% in the past year.

He views any potential pullback as a \"buy the dip\" opportunity. The stock market looks poised for a 7% correction by mid-November, according to technical analyst Mark Newton of Fundstrat. Newton told clients in a note on Thursday that he is expecting the S&P 500 to see weakness heading into November as investor sentiment hits complacent levels just ahead of the general election on November 5. \"While intermediate-term bullish these remains very much intact, it's doubtful that US Equities continue to push up into and post-election without any consolidation,\" Newton said. Newton said the potential correction he expects in the stock market is likely to be a \"short-term correction only\" and \"not the start of a larger decline,\" playing into Fundstrat's Tom Lee's consistent message that investors should view any decline in the stock market as a \"buy the dip\" opportunity. Newton is monitoring the 5,900 level on the S&P 500 as potential resistance for the index. The S&P 500 traded at around 5,850 on Friday. \"The issues with near-term complacency (as judged by low Equity put/call levels), waning breadth, poor seasonal trends and cyclical projections for November as well as SPX's largest sector, Technology, not performing well of late, are all reasons to be alert for possible trend change in the weeks to come,\" Newton explained. One \"key reason\" Newton is turning bearish in the short-term is that the current rally in stocks that started in early August is 88 days long, which is exactly how long the April 19 to July 16 rally lasted before a sell-off materialized. From a time perspective, that's \"why this rally might 'run out of steam,\" Newton said. Other areas of technical weakness that Newton is monitoring includes negative divergences in momentum as measured by the RSI and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators, a lack of bearish investors as measured by the AAII investor sentiment data, and seasonal cycles that show a peak in the stock market in mid-to-late October followed by a sell-off through November. \"This market has seemingly 'dodged a bullet' thus far during one of the historically worst periods during most election years. However, investors should not take this to mean that the coast is clear for an interrupted rally higher all year,\" Newton said. Read the original article on Business Insider "

The measures include quicker credit for developers and support for renovations in urban shantytowns. But analysts say the new measures aren't enough to solve the market's structural challenges. China officials have directed a wave of stimulus measures at the country's beleaguered property market, but the effort hasn't done much to impress Wall Street experts. On Thursday, China unveiled new measures to prop up its flailing housing market, including quicker access to credit for developers and renovations in run-down urban areas. The government's \"white list\" of unfinished housing projects eligible for government financing will now receive more funds to encourage banks to increase lending to those projects, the Ministry of Housing said in a press conference. The funds will amount to 4 trillion yuan ($550 billion) by the end of the year, almost double the current quota of 2.2 trillion yuan. The Housing Ministry also unveiled plans to update the country's run-down downtown areas, or \"urban villages,\" with a million apartment renovations planned. While the efforts appear to be a big swing attempt by Beijing to remedy an issue at the heart of its economic crisis, analysts on Wall Street have been underwhelmed. Experts from Goldman Sachs, BCA Research, and AXA Investment Managers this week struck a pessimistic tone on the potential for the new policies to revive China's property sector. Goldman Sachs analysts said the measures may slightly help real estate financing, home completions, home transactions, and prices in large cities, but they won't be enough to combat the market's structural issues. \"Given many structural challenges in the property sector and still-limited policy support for housing destocking, we maintain our view that there appears no quick fix for the nationwide property sector,\" Goldman Sachs said in a Friday note. Analysts from BCA Research echoed that view, saying the plan's details were \"underwhelming.\" They pointed in particular to the latest aims at the country's \"white list\" project loans, which they say haven't been successful so far amid a fragmented property market and banks' hesitation to lend to risky projects. They also said the apartment renovation plan lacks detail and mirrors a similar program introduced in 2015, which aimed to renovate 6 million units annually for several years. The latest plan, though, provides no clear timeline.          "

Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen But while Reeves hopes to sell the package to bond markets and voters alike, she and Prime Minister Keir Starmer face a battle convincing cabinet members that they are taking the right approach to the fiscal statement on Oct. 30 that will set the tone for their administration. Senior ministers are in revolt over departmental savings required in a one-year spending review accompanying the budget, with some going over Reeves’ head to write formal protest letters to the premier. Party officials who requested anonymity to discussing internal ructions said the entire cabinet, bar a handful of ultra-loyalists, were at loggerheads with the Treasury, while Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner pressed a standoff with Reeves over spending at least two days past a Wednesday deadline. The dissent presents a fresh challenge to Starmer’s fledgling government, which secured a landslide election win on July 4, but has since become mired in a scandal about ministers accepting freebies and a gloomy narrative about the UK’s economic situation. The test for Starmer and Reeves is to persuade their restless party — which had been in opposition for 14 years — that short-term pain is needed to deliver long-term gains and ultimately reelection in five years’ time. For now, the rebellion has fallen on deaf ears in Downing Street. Starmer and Reeves are united behind the need for difficult immediate decisions on tax and spending in order to fix the foundations of the economy they inherited from the Conservatives, people familiar with their thinking said. Despite cabinet complaints that cutbacks to projects in 2025-26 are tantamount to returning to austerity — the policy of spending cuts pursued by the Tories last decade — Reeves will argue the Conservatives salted the earth by slashing taxes and baking in impossible future public spending cuts in a cynical attempt to hamstring their likely Labour successors.

Globally, hiring has slowed as workers avoid the risk of switching jobs in an uncertain environment and employers are reluctant to recruit due to inflation and higher interest rates. \"We have continued to focus on execution and operational discipline, balancing field capacity with strategic investments,\" CEO Sander van‘t Noordende said in a statement. Randstad also on Tuesday announced its intention to buy Zorgwerk, a Dutch digital healthcare marketplace, in a deal worth about 323 million euros.Third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) before one-off items came in at 196 million euros ($212 million), slightly above the 192 million expected by analysts on average in a company-provided consensus. Quarterly revenue of 6.02 billion dropped 5.9% organically, a little more than the 5.6% decrease expected by analysts. Revenue per working day was down 9% in North America and 8%in Northern Europe in the third quarter. In Southern Europe, UK and Latin America, it was stable at -2%. Oddo's analyst Konrad Zomer said in a research note that the results were \"solid given the tough market circumstances\", adding that the stabilizing conditions mentioned by Randstad were \"a positive surprise.\" Asked about the upcoming U.S. election, van‘t Noordende told Reuters: \"getting the elections behind us is the most important thing\", as Randstad's clients will benefit from clarity about the economic climate and \"start adjusting their strategies.\" Uncertainty around the election and high interest rates have made clients hesitant about investing in infrastructure and hiring, he added.

Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says Since the Fed kicked off its long-anticipated loosening cycle on Sept. 18 with a cut of 50 basis points, double the median forecast, emerging-market assets have traded as if borrowing costs in the world’s largest economy will remain high. That’s left developing world assets in limbo and headed for another span of underperformance. In little over a month, the Fed rate cut has been eclipsed by fresh risks that are keeping global investors shy on the asset class, overshadowing the gains that Fed easing cycles might usually be expected to bring. While the threats have taken different forms — higher Treasury yields, a stronger dollar, greater volatility in currency options — the underlying themes have been just two: the potential return of Donald Trump as US president and China’s inadequate stimulus measures. That means that once again, traders in emerging markets are positioning defensively for an inflationary US economy and a deflationary Chinese one. “We remain in a world with two potentially existential threats to EM – China weakness and Trump,” said Paul McNamara, investment director at Gam UK Ltd. in London. “A strong US economy without inflation is good for EM, but persistent inflation will not only postpone further cuts, but weigh on all risk assets into the medium term.” Though there was an initial boost to emerging markets from the Fed move, it was first interrupted by strong US data that revived fears of resurgent inflation, and later comments by presidential candidate Trump that exacerbated them. The Republican nominee has put tariffs and protectionism at the center of his agenda. If implemented, that’s likely to raise consumer prices in the US and undermine demand for exports from the developing world, according to many economists. “We’re just weeks away from a US election that might lead to a Trump economic assault on the biggest EM out there, China,” said Charlie Robertson, head of macro strategy at FIM Partners. “It’s close to a coin flip as to who wins the US election, and equally makes it hard to choose a local markets trade to like.”                               ",

The peculiar sight of a risk-loving rally in U.S. equity markets and corporate high yield debt alongside new records for the traditional safe haven of gold may speak something of the hedged outlook, with geopolitical and electoral risks coloring the booming domestic economy. And with neither candidate for the White House proposing any fiscal retrenchment ahead, trepidation about rising budget deficits during a period of such brisk growth is also adding investor anxiety. The U.S. budget deficit grew 8% to $1.833 trillion for fiscal 2024, the highest outside of the COVID era, as interest on the federal debt exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, the Treasury said on Friday. The shortfall amounted to 6.4% of gross domestic product, up from 6.2% a year earlier. A fiscal think-tank, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, recently estimated that Republican Donald Trump's plans would pile up $7.5 trillion in new debt, more than twice the $3.5 trillion envisaged in Democrat Kamala Harris's proposals. Shifting odds on post-election Congressional math, however, may have much to do with how any of those fiscal plans pan out. At 4.12%, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hovered close to 2-1/2 month highs on Monday even with another quarter-point Federal Reserve interest rate cut still near fully priced for next month. With the Atlanta Fed's real-rime \"GDPNow\" model indicating growth in excess of 3.4% and U.S. economic surprise index at its most positive in six months, the early Q3 earnings season is impressing again with 83% of the 71 S&P500 firms reported beating forecasts. While the blended annual profit growth estimate for the 500 has dipped to 4% from the 5% expected pre-season, according to LSEG data, revenue growth is holding to expectations and a return to brisk double-digit earnings expansions is still forecast for next quarter and right through next year. A heavy diary of updates this week spans industrial, defence, energy and financial sectors but Tesla's quarterly likely grabs many headlines mid-week. Overseas, attention was back on China on Monday as the latest official lending rate cuts there were mostly expected and met with a shrug by markets. The one-year loan prime rate was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.10% from 3.35%, while the five-year LPR was cut by the same margin to 3.6% from 3.85% previously.                ",

Though DOGE remains king of the week, with more than 30% in gains, its modest rise of 2% in a single day may hint at cooling off. Popcat's resurgence coincides with Bitcoin's breakout from the recent four-month slump. Notably, during the first ascension of Bitcoin, POPCAT reached its all-time high of $1.50, but it later settled at $1.37. Meanwhile, DOGE was boosted by investors looking for altcoin exposure and surged to $0.15 amidst the broader market rally. When the price touched $1.23, a local low just days after the all-time high, there was a chunky withdrawal of roughly $4 million worth of POPCAT tokens from exchanges last week. This coordinated movement may indicate accumulation by buyers after a strong DOGE rally. However, technical analysis indicators present a more confusing outlook for POPCAT’s immediate future. While the hourly charts give bearish indications, with the RSI and MACD indicators trending downwards, strong accumulation patterns and probable capital rotation from DOGE may support upward momentum. The established support line at $1.23 seems to sustain itself rather well and might form the ground for future gains. "

While the other firms are seen posting an only 1.8% increase in earnings, their results are projected to accelerate to double-digit gains in the first quarter of 2025. “Earnings season is off to the races, and despite some mixed signals, appears to be in good shape,” said Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “We’re in the early innings though, and coming up on the final days before the election and the next Fed meeting. Never a dull moment.” With the odds tilting toward both Donald Trump winning the US presidential election and Republicans controlling Congress, investors have started ramping up assets which had thrived in the wake of the former president’s 2016 victory, according to Bank of America Corp. strategist Michael Hartnett. Price action in the past week shows banks, small caps and the dollar are “front-running 2016 bull moves,” Hartnett wrote in a note. US equities and the greenback surged in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s win over Hillary Clinton in November 2016. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, notching its 47th record in 2024. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. The Russell 2000 of smaller firms underperformed Friday, but was up almost 2% this week.

Bucking the trend in the equities market was the European heavyweight software company SAP, which surged to an all-time high after raising its full-year targets. The MSCI All-World index ticked 0.2% lower, while U.S. futures pointed to another weaker start open after Monday's drop in the benchmark indices. \"We're getting very close to the U.S. election and the data in the U.S. has been strong. So there is a question about how much the Fed can do,\" said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The chances of the U.S. Federal Reserve delivering a quarter-point rate cut at its Nov. 7 meeting have receded to 87% from near certainty a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch tool. A host of data signalling U.S. economic strength have thrown cold water on bets over another outsized cut, following the Fed's decision to cut rates by half a point in September. Adding to the uncertainty was the looming U.S. election, where former Republican president Donald Trump and Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris are caught in a tight battle to win over some of the more competitive states ahead of the Nov. 5 voting day. Trump's lead in online betting polls has aided the dollar's recent rise to a 2-1/2 month high as his proposed tariff and tax policies could mean stronger inflation and keep U.S. interest rates higher for longer. The dollar index was just below that peak at 103.89. \"As neither party holds a clear advantage in any of the key swing states that could decide the outcome, the race remains too close for pollsters to call, and we expect volatility to pick up in the coming weeks amid elevated uncertainty,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer, UBS Global Wealth Management. Political and geopolitical uncertainty kept safe-haven gold pinned near record levels, up 0.6% at $2,735 an ounce. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose 2 basis points to 4.21%, extending a sharp move higher and hitting their highest since late July.

S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also slid 0.5%, while contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) led the way lower, down about 0.6%. Stocks are coming under pressure amid growing doubts that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut rates aggressively — or even hold steady in November. Strength in the economy, cautious Fedspeak, and concerns about the fiscal impact of an increasingly expected Trump election win are factors in play. Amid the uncertainty, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) steadied above 4.20% after Monday's sharp gains helped push it above that level for first time since July. The bond selling has weighed on rate-sensitive stocks such as real estate, with rising yields typically a catalyst for stock drawdowns. Earnings season picks up pace on Tuesday, with General Motors (GM) the highlight in a rush of reports. 3M (MMM), Verizon (VZ), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) are among the many top-tier results on deck. At the same time, anticipation is building for Tesla's (TSLA) and Boeing's (BA) earnings due Wednesday as both grapple with headwinds.

        "body": "The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how environmental and facilities services stocks fared in Q2, starting with Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK). Many environmental and facility services are non-discretionary (sports stadiums need to be cleaned after events), recurring, and performed through longer-term contracts. This makes for more predictable and stickier revenue streams. Additionally, there has been an increasing focus on emissions and water conservation over the last decade, driving innovation in the sector and demand for new services. Despite these tailwinds, environmental and facility services companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact commercial construction projects that drive incremental demand for these services. The 13 environmental and facilities services stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Thankfully, environmental and facilities services stocks have been resilient with share prices up 6.3% on average since the latest earnings results. Originally founded to focus on Alaska’s oil pipelines, Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) provides consulting and engineering services to the water and infrastructure industries. Tetra Tech reported revenues of $1.11 billion, up 12.4% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.8%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ backlog sales estimates and optimistic earnings guidance for the full year. Tetra Tech achieved the highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is up 16.2% since reporting and currently trades at $49.76. Is now the time to buy Tetra Tech?

        "body": "Tap-2-earn (T2E) games and memecoins face a fast-paced market with frequent new entries and high turnover. The rapid emergence of new projects can dilute attention, leading to shorter lifespans for most tokens unless they can establish strong communities or unique utilities. Most memecoins rely solely on social media hype, and 97% fail shortly after launch. They often capitalize on media buzz and viral trends to gain rapid traction, but this approach lacks long-term sustainability and viability. As the buzz dissipates, vibrant and dedicated communities provide the much-needed staying power that the hype fails to deliver. Some memecoin projects are finding success with a community-based approach. The team behind LADYS recently announced a new roadmap, which marks a leap forward for its community-building efforts through novel initiatives and features. In fact, LADYS' significant achievements in the memecoin space date from its launch. A mention from Elon Musk on X triggered a notable price surge back in 2023. In 2024, LADYS was one of six memecoins to receive a nomination for CoinMarketCap's memecoin of the year. The second stage of the project's roadmap involved forming community partnerships and a token-gated Discord group, which enabled holders to connect and achieve community growth. In phase 3, the community grew to more than 100,000. The platform is further rolling out its community vision to enhance the memecoin’s visibility and accessibility. Most of the play-to-earn games launched during 2021's NFT craze are conspicously absent from the space. P2E is struggling for a number of reasons, including huge gaps in the tokenomics and playability aspects of NFT-phase Web3 games. Most existing P2E games either lack viable tokenomics or are unplayable, which isn't true for T2E games launched on Telegram. Many complicated on-chain actions are required to participate in P2E games. In comparison, anyone with a Telegram account can play TON ecosystem games. Banana attracted over a million players within 72 hours of being launched, and this number grew to eight million in a month. The T2E model’s ease of playability stands out. To start collecting rewards, a player need only click their device. Completing simple, straightforward tasks comes with additional incentives. These tasks include linking one's socials, joining related communities, and other community-related efforts. The model introduces a balanced rewards approach, reducing the risk of token oversupply.        "

Lander, who is running for New York City mayor, oversees a system that has been among the most aggressive in divesting from fossil fuel companies over climate concerns, a cause that has lagged with other public investment institutions. Among other things the main New York City funds have sold out of publicly traded fossil fuel reserve owners, making them \"the first sizable U.S. public pension system that has divested from both its active and passive publicly traded fossil fuel portfolio,\" according to Lander's office.

Brazil’s resources rank eighth globally, well behind Australia, Kazakhstan and Canada. The last assessment of Brazilian reserves took place 40 years ago, but elevated uranium prices are reviving the nation’s ambitions to seek out new deposits. Nuclear Industries of Brazil — or INB — is seeking to collaborate with global companies to carry out new research in regions known for their mineral potential. The state-owned company plans to call for bids from partners interested in exploring areas in Brazil’s northeast, midwest and south by year end. “We aim to move forward 40 years in four,” INB President Adauto Seixas said in an interview. “We have already received visits from companies from Russia, India, Korea, France, Australia, the United States and China.” Brazil’s push comes amid surging interest in uranium, with investors piling into a radioactive metal that underpins a global push to tap carbon-free energy in the form of nuclear power. Uranium prices this year peaked in early February and though they’ve since retreated, levels are still above the historical average. The Brazilian initiative is called the Uranium and Associated Mineral Resources Prospecting and Mining Partnership Program — or Prouranio. Exploration will be in areas that hold other minerals including copper, gold and rare earth elements that occur alongside uranium. INB’s strategy includes mining already mapped areas with help from private firms. Yet, Brazilian minerals research industry group ABPM argues that a partnership model doesn’t suit the private sector, which would want to operate independently. The group’s head, Luis Mauricio Azevedo, suggests that Brazil should open up uranium exploration and development — a move that could help boost global supplies. “If we have the reserves we imagine, Brazil could be a storehouse of energy for the world,” he said.

The Internal Revenue Service detailed the increases in its annual inflation adjustments announced Tuesday. For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately in tax year 2025, the standard deduction is rising to $15,000 — up $400 from 2024. For couples who file jointly, that standard deduction will be $30,000 for 2025, an $800 jump from the year prior. And heads of households will get a $22,500 standard deduction, up $600 from 2024. Income thresholds for all seven federal tax bracket levels were also revised upward. The top tax rate, which remains 37%, will cover incomes greater than $626,350 for single taxpayers in tax year 2025, for example — compared to $609,350 in 2024. The IRS makes such adjustments for each tax year to account for inflation, which has recently been on a downward trend. Last month, inflation in the U.S. dropped to its lowest point in more than three years, marking some encouraging economic news — but Americans are still feeling some key price pressures. “Core” prices, a gauge of underlying inflation, remained elevated in September, driven up by rising costs for medical care, clothing, auto insurance and airline fares. While taxpayers will again see higher standard deductions for 2025, the increases announced Tuesday are less than those seen in recent years. In tax adjustments announced last year, for example, the IRS raised single filers’ standard deduction by $750 between the 2023 and 2024 tax years — and by $1,500 and $1,100 for married couples and heads of households, respectively.

Intesa Sanpaolo is under investigation by prosecutors in the southern Italian city of Bari after it emerged that the accounts of around 3,500 customers, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and former Prime Minister Mario Draghi, might have been violated. The Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic (COPASIR) is closely following the data breach case involving Intesa, the people said speaking on condition of anonymity because such matters are confidential. COPASIR plans to collect information by summoning people who could have relevant information, but at present there are no scheduled hearings for Intesa executives, they added. Intesa issued a public apology for the episode on Oct. 13 after Meloni acknowledged the reported incident in a television interview, saying she expected the judiciary to investigate what happened and any possible conspiracy behind it. The bank's board last week named General Antonio De Vita, a former senior police officer who recently retired from the force, as its head of security, a new division it created after the breach. Banks' IT security is a major concern for the industry's supervisors. Intesa's rogue employee did not hack the system, another person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The employee had clearance to access clients' account data due to their role within the bank. By spreading the access over a period of roughly two years the worker was able to avoid triggering the control system, which would detect, for example, an unusually high number of data requests relating to one account over a short time. The official COPASIR agenda shows a hearing scheduled on Wednesday, Oct. 23 for Cabinet Undersecretary Alfredo Mantovano, a senior government official in charge of intelligence matters.

        "body": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Fishing regulators are delaying a plan for stricter fishing rules amid concerns about a decline in baby lobsters in the warming waters off New England. The regulators are looking to institute a new rule that fishermen need to abide by a larger minimum size for the lobsters they trap. The change is only 1/16th of an inch or 1.6 millimeters, but regulators have said it will help preserve the population of the valuable crustaceans, as many small lobsters will need to be tossed back to the ocean. Some fishermen have argued the change is unnecessary and will be disruptive to one of the country's most lucrative seafood industries when it is already stressed by warming waters, surging expenses and new rules to protect whales. They've argued for the new rules to be delayed or scrapped. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has said the minimum size must be changed because of a recent decline of more than 35% of the young lobster stock in the Gulf of Maine, a key fishing ground. But the commission voted Monday to push back the implementation of the change from Jan. 1 to July 1, 2025. Maine fishermen, who catch most of the country's lobster, remain opposed to the size increase, said Kevin Kelley, a spokesperson for the Maine Lobstermen's Association. However, the delay will help prevent U.S. fishermen from being put at a competitive disadvantage with Canada, which also has a large lobster fishing industry, he said. “We are hopeful that this will provide more time to address unintended consequences of an increase, specifically the fact that unless Canada also changes its gauge size, Canadian lobstermen will still be able to catch smaller lobster,” Kelley said. The size change applies to the Gulf of Maine, where commission officials have said the stock declined by 39% when comparing 2020-22 to 2016-18. Scientists have cited the warming of the Gulf of Maine as a potential stressor for lobsters. The revelation about the decline in young lobsters surprised many in the industry, and some fishermen have questioned the data. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat who represents the Maine coast in Congress and has advocated to block the new rules, called the data “outdated.” The concern about a drop in young lobsters arrived at a time of relative prosperity for the lobster industry. The value of U.S. lobster can fluctuate considerably from year to year, and topped $900 million for the first time in 2021. It remained well over $450 million, which is still a historically high number, last year. The decision to postpone the size requirements will protect the lobster population while also taking into account the market concerns raised by members of the industry, said Patrick Keliher, who is chair of the Atlantic States lobster board as well as commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources. “My hope is that the benefits of the gauge change combined with the increase in young-of-the-year lobsters we’re seeing in the settlement survey will result in a healthy, sustainable resource for future generations,” Keliher said.

He is also unconvinced such a tool would even help ECB messaging. “Given the prevailing evidence, I do not see a compelling case for introducing dot plots for the Eurosystem,” Nagel said at Harvard University on Tuesday. “On the other hand, I firmly believe that we can and should enhance how we account for uncertainty in our macroeconomic projections.” The remarks advance an ongoing debate among ECB officials on how to better frame their quarterly forecasts after a failure to accurately predict the spike in inflation during the pandemic. Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel said earlier this year that dot plots could help in this regard, while acknowledging that they have their own shortcomings. Other officials in the region have also been skeptical. ECB President Christine Lagarde said in July that this option won’t be discussed in a review of the central bank’s strategy that should be completed next year. Nagel proposed a focus on “more effective alternatives.” “One might be to enhance the communication of our existing measures of uncertainty,” he said. “Another might be to develop new measures, such as scenario and sensitivity analyses, as well as improved fan charts. We must carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each approach.” --With assistance from Mark Schroers.

The new Stable Diffusion 3.5 series is more customizable and versatile than Stability's previous-generation tech, the company claims — as well as more performant. There are three models in total: Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large: With 8 billion parameters, it's the most powerful model, capable of generating images at resolutions up to 1 megapixel. (Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer.) Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo: A distilled version of Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large that generates images more quickly, at the cost of some quality. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium: A model optimized to run on edge devices like smartphones and laptops, capable of generating images ranging from 0.25 to 2 megapixel resolutions. While Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large and 3.5 Large Turbo are available today, 3.5 Medium won't be released until October 29. Stability says that the Stable Diffusion 3.5 models should generate more \"diverse\" outputs — that is to say, images depicting people with different skin tones and features — without the need for \"extensive\" prompting. \"During training, each image is captioned with multiple versions of prompts, with shorter prompts prioritized,\" Hanno Basse, Stability's chief technology officer, told TechCrunch in an interview. \"This ensures a broader and more diverse distribution of image concepts for any given text description. Like most generative AI companies, we train on a wide variety of data, including filtered publicly available datasets and synthetic data.\" Some companies have cludgily built these sorts of \"diversifying\" features into image generators in the past, prompting outcries on social media. An older version of Google's Gemini chatbot, for example, would show an anachronistic group of figures for historical prompts such as \"a Roman legion\" or \"U.S. senators.\" Google was forced to pause image generation of people for nearly six months while it developed a fix. With any luck, Stability's approach will be more thoughtful than others. We can't give impressions, unfortunately, as Stability didn't provide early access. Stability's previous flagship image generator, Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, was roundly criticized for its peculiar artifacts and poor adherence to prompts. The company warns that Stable Diffusion 3.5 models might suffer from similar prompting errors; it blames engineering and architectural trade-offs. But Stability also asserts the models are more robust than their predecessors in generating images across a range of different styles, including 3D art.              "

For further gains, Chief Executive Officer Fabian Kon says Milei’s administration needs to continue cooling price increases while dismantling regulations and capital controls that he sees holding back investment and growth. “Over the next 10 months, the government needs to get rid of restrictions in the economy. For example, controls on imports and allowing people to obtain foreign currencies,” Kon said in an interview Friday. “If all of that goes well, we’ll see inflation fall and credit increase.” Mortgages in particular represent a key opportunity for Argentina’s top banks to expand their lending portfolios after going dormant in 2018 at the start of the country’s economic crisis. Outside of a brief spike before the downturn, home loans haven’t existed for decades for most prospective buyers, who tend to pay for properties in stacks of US dollar bills. Galicia started offering up to 30-year mortgages this May at a measure of inflation plus 5.5% interest for its customers. “We’re discovering that we’re solving an issue for the first time in Argentina: Someone with a formal job can buy a property,” Kon said of the home loans, adding that 70% of the people who have taken out mortgages are below the age of 40. Galicia is enjoying the renewed wave of optimism in Argentina from Milei’s economic overhaul. Its US-listed shares have delivered 216% in returns to investors so far this year, outperforming more than a dozen other Latin American banks with American depositary receipts over the same span, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also tapped international debt markets this year for the first time since 2016, selling $325 million in bonds at a 7.87% yield, well below Argentina’s sovereign risk level near 1,100 basis points above benchmark US Treasury notes. A sustained demand for loans coupled with a stronger economy, Kon added, would push Galicia to issue even more debt in capital markets locally or abroad. Galicia, which acquired HSBC Holdings Plc.’s operations in the country earlier this year, is Argentina’s largest private bank measured by total assets, currently over $15 billion, according to central bank data.

Armed with $14 million from Nvidia and Boeing, Freeform aims to change that, building a new metal additive printing process that they say changes the game — and yes, there's an AI angle too. Co-founders Erik Palitsch (CEO) and TJ Ronacher (president) both worked at SpaceX, where they were principal architect and lead analyst, respectively, of the Merlin engines and other programs. While there, they saw the potential of 3D printing parts using metal, but also experienced the method's shortcomings firsthand. \"We saw the potential of metal printing; it has the potential to transform basically any industry that makes metal things. But adoption has been slow and success has been marginal at best,\" said Palitsch. \"Why is it not practical to use at scale? Fundamentally, because of three things: crappy and inconsistent quality; speed — commercial printers are very slow; and cost — the price for these printers is astronomical.\" They concluded that if they could operationalize the process to provide a printing service rather than sell a printer, they could crack the whole thing wide open. So they joined up with Tasso Lappas, former CTO of Velo3D, to start Freeform. The primary mistake companies were making was using the likes of CNC machines, which are commonly used in traditional manufacturing, as a model for the metal-printing business. In that case, you sell the machine and its software, and make it work with whatever shapes and processes you use. But metal additive is different, Palitsch said. \"The way these things work today is they're 'open loop' — they're basically playing back a file,\" he explained. \"They needed to be smarter than that, because the process by which you melt metal powder with a laser is extremely complicated, and in a way infinitely variable.\" Selling people a machine and saying \"become an expert to make it work, good luck\" isn't a recipe for success. \"But when you decide you're not going to build and package a printer into a box, when you have the freedom to build an automated factory from clean sheet, there's a lot you can do,\" Palitsch said. Their solution is to provide printing as a service using a closed-loop process in a custom machine that monitors the print on a microsecond scale, adjusting various factors to achieve the kind of print that is expected at a workplace like SpaceX.

Rob Nelson kicked off the discussion, saying, “You are going to be able to tokenize a pretty big property and fractionalize that investment and return opportunity at any scale you want.” He emphasized that tokenization could transform real estate investments, allowing individuals to own property without large upfront costs. Nelson also noted its potential in industries like entertainment and sports, saying, “The dream of tokenization is a lot of people don’t understand how many ways you could apply this.\" Charles Menke expanded on the conversation, noting the historical exclusivity of certain high-value assets. \"Like a Stradivarius or a Mona Lisa, it was strictly owned by the hyper rich always. Tokenization allows assets to be broken into smaller pieces, opening access to middle markets,\" he said. Menke also raised concerns about price volatility, adding, “I'm not sure if it's going to be for the positive or for the negative.” Rob Nelson then introduced the example of the Green Bay Packers, saying, “It's a billion-dollar asset, and you're going to hold it and pass it on to your family members.” He suggested that if ownership was more fluid, it could potentially affect the value, similar to the scenario Menke described with tokenized assets. David Packham offered a different perspective, saying, “There’s a high degree of emotional attachment from the fan base, so they are more likely to treat that less as an investment.” He further explained how tokenization could be structured in a way that wouldn’t necessarily impact the underlying asset, noting, “What you’re really trading is the active value of the asset and providing ways to tap that effectively without impacting the underlying asset at all.” "

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Strategists at two of Wall Street’s biggest banks have reached diverging conclusions about where the US stock market is heading in the years ahead. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance With the S&P 500 Index hovering near record highs, strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are warning that stocks may deliver a paltry 3% annually in the coming years — restrained by an already-high starting point and elevated Treasury yields that could siphon money off into bonds and other types of assets. Over at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s asset and wealth-management divisions, analysts offer a more benign outlook. They’re anticipating that US large-cap equities — the big company stocks that have driven much of the recent gains — will remain a pillar of investors’ portfolios and return an annualized 6.7% over the next 10-15 years. While the rally has made prices a bit harder to justify when plotted against earnings — and the bank’s strategists say valuations will eventually need to go down — they anticipate that solid fundamentals will compensate for that. “We want to make sure that people do understand that we are assuming multiple contraction,” Monica Issar, JPMorgan Wealth Management’s global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions, said at a round-table on Monday. “Multiple contraction will be offset with healthier macro and corporate fundamentals over the next 10 years, and that foundation is a sturdier point in time for investors to allocate capital.” Read: Decade of Big S&P 500 Gains Is Over, Goldman Strategists Say Still, the bank’s estimate for S&P 500 performance trails the long-term average of an annualized 11% since the benchmark’s inception in 1957 through the end of 2023. The diverging forecasts signal the broader uncertainty that’s hovering over Wall Street even after the Federal Reserve’s long-awaited pivot last month toward easing monetary policy. That’s in part because of how much stocks have already rallied the past two years thanks to the resilient economy, strong corporate profits and speculation about artificial intelligence breakthroughs — sending the S&P 500 to a 22% gain this year. It’s up more than 60% since bottoming out in October 2022. Goldman Sachs declined to comment further.            ",

It's Interface's first outside capital; the startup had been completely bootstrapped. \"Interface is trusted by more than 100 financial institutions across North America, processing millions of interactions every day,\" CEO and co-founder Srinivas Njay told TechCrunch. \"We're generating tens of millions in annual recurring revenue.\" Njay said that the inspiration for Interface came from his father, who owned a credit union in India. Previously, Njay worked at Microsoft as a product manager on the Bing advertising team and at EA as a senior product manager on mobile games. Njay teamed up with Bruce Kim, the founder of customer management and billing company Inovaware, in 2019 to launch Interface. \"The big national banks are investing heavily in AI to transform their banking operations,\" Njay said. \"But for many regional and community-based financial institutions, staffing and resourcing this capability is simply out of reach. Interface democratizes access to AI.\" Interface's core product is a collection of voice- and text-based AI agents designed to handle basic bank customer service requests. Powered by models trained on in-house data, the agents can perform tasks like helping modify mortgage payments and opening new accounts. Banks can customize the agents by fine-tuning them on their internal data. The agents can also be configured to upsell products based on information like the content of prior chats. \"Our AI is specifically designed for the banking industry,\" Njay said, \"complete with pre-built integrations, data models, and workflows.\" Financial institutions are piloting AI — and in particular generative AI — for applications ranging from customer service to predictive analytics. According to a March survey cited in American Banker, more than half of global and U.S. banks intend to implement generative AI at some level over the next year. Besides Interface, AI startups trying to nab a slice of banks' business include Hyperplane, which builds AI models to predict customer behavior; Cambio, which creates AI to talk to a bank's customers; and Digital Onboarding, which specializes in strengthening banks' relationships with customers. Banking customers are wary of the tech, however. In a J.D. Power poll, only 27% said that they'd trust AI for financial information and advice, while less than half said they'd take product recommendations from AI.     "

Along with the US contribution, the EU, which has approved a loan for up to €35 billion ($37.9 billion), would end up providing at least $20 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The UK announced Monday it will put in £2.3 billion ($3 billion), with Japan and Canada expected to provide similar amounts, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The G-7 aims for initial funds to reach Ukraine by the end of the year, with the bulk of the support being released next year in tranches, the people said. The aid will go toward meeting many of Ukraine’s military and economic needs. The loan plan is an effort to lock in guaranteed funding for Ukraine, as its allies brace for a possible election victory by President Donald Trump, who has been critical of sending US aid to Kyiv. It comes at a crucial time for the country, which has been struggling to hold its defensive lines amid a sustained push by Russia. The people cautioned that the final details of contributions from each nation are still being ironed out and could change before an announcement is made. The G-7 has collectively frozen about $280 billion of Russian central bank assets, with the vast majority of the funds in Europe, where they are expected to generate about $3 billion to $5 billion in profits a year. The loans would be repaid using the proceeds generated by the immobilized funds. G-7 leaders reached a political agreement to provide Kyiv with the loans at a summit in June but have been locked in discussions to finalize a deal since. The US was seeking assurances from the EU that the assets would stay frozen in the longer term but Hungary has blocked changes to the EU’s sanctions regime, arguing that any decisions should wait until after the US election.

Winfield, a leading U.S. First Amendment lawyer who represented The Associated Press for three decades and championed freedom of expression for journalists around the world, died on Tuesday. He was 91. Winfield died in his sleep at Bellevue Hospital in New York, said his daughter, Nicole Winfield, who is AP's Rome-based Italy and Vatican correspondent. He had suffered head trauma after a fall on Oct. 7. Winfield served as general counsel for AP for three decades while a partner at the New York law firm of Roger & Wells, which became Clifford Chance US LLP. During that time, he worked closely with American publishers and editors, defending AP as well as other media clients in hundreds of press freedom cases. “When we would ask Dick, as our lawyer, to review a sensitive piece of copy, his first words were often some form of ‘What a great story!'” said Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive officer of the AP from 1985-2003. “And then we would go through the story, not to weaken it but to strengthen it against whatever reaction it might bring. He understood the newsroom and appreciated the dedication and the care that had gone into the work.” Winfield was by Boccardi's side when he testified to Congress about the performance of news outlets in covering the disputed 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. After he retired from the firm, Winfield became a founding director of the International Senior Lawyers Project, a non-governmental organization that mobilizes pro bono legal support to advance the rule of law and accountable, inclusive economic development around the world. Winfield’s volunteer activities to promote freedom of expression took him to over 20 countries. He led media reform programs in several former Soviet bloc nations, trained lawyers and judges from Albania to Zimbabwe about freedom of expression and served as a court observer in overseas media defamation cases. “Dick Winfield was a true pillar of the First Amendment, and the impact of his work protecting journalists has been felt around the world,” said Karen Kaiser, senior vice president and general counsel at AP. “He was a trailblazer for the AP, setting the foundations for the legal protection for journalism across the country. And above all, he was a kind a gracious person and a great mentor to younger generations.” Winfield also taught media law classes at the Columbia and Fordham law schools, both in New York City. Born in Chicago on Jan. 20, 1933, Winfield grew up in Valley Stream, Long Island, the eldest son of Richard Paul Winfield and Mary Bertrand Monaghan Winfield.                       "

Troy, Michigan-based Altair is working with investment bankers to gauge interest from potential suitors, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential. If the talks are successful, a deal could be signed in coming weeks, one of the sources said, cautioning that a transaction is not guaranteed and Altair may choose to stay independent. Altair's shares jumped more than 14% on Tuesday after Reuters reported on the company's sale talks. Potential bidders include rival design software makers such as PTC and Cadence Design Systems, the sources said. Reuters could not determine whether PTC and Cadence have approached Altair. Altair, PTC, and Cadence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Engineering software companies have become attractive acquisition targets as investors bet on companies that could benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence. In January, design software Synopsys agreed to buy smaller rival Ansys in a deal worth about $35 billion. Earlier this year, Bentley Systems, which competes with Altair, held talks with Schneider Electric but a deal did not materialize. Founded in 1985, Altair makes a range of software solutions, including what is referred to as computer-aided engineering software that helps engineers design, analyze and manufacture products. Altair's stock has jumped about 55% over the past year and the company trades at a higher multiple compared to its peers. Altair trades at roughly 46 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), compared to roughly 30 times for Bentley Systems, according to LSEG data. In its most recent quarterly earnings, Altair posted an 8% rise in software revenue to $135.4 million, at the higher end of its guidance. Altair works with several large corporations including Ford Motor and International Paper, according to its website. (Reporting by Anirban Sen and Milana Vinn in New YorkEditing by Nick Zieminski) ",

        "body": "A recall of hundreds of frozen waffle products and other toaster foods sold in many U.S. grocery stores has expanded because they may be contaminated with dangerous listeria bacteria, the manufacturer said Tuesday. TreeHouse Foods Inc., of Oak Brook, Illinois, said the updated recall includes all products made at a factory in Ontario, Canada, and sold at stores including Albertson's, Aldi, Dollar General, Kroger, Publix, Target, Walmart and others. The recall includes frozen toaster waffles, Belgian waffles and pancakes, the company said. No illnesses linked to the recall have been confirmed. The company is working with the U.S. and Canadian food safety regulators to resolve the problem. The recalled waffles are sold under a variety of names including Walmart’s Great Value and Target’s Good & Gather. A complete list of the affected products can be found on the TreeHouse website. Consumers should throw away the products or return them to stores for a refund. TreeHouse officials issued a limited recall on Oct. 18 after routine testing found listeria at the Brantford, Ontario, factory. Additional testing indicated that more manufacturing lines at the plant could be contaminated with the bacteria, the company said. Production was halted and the company said it intends to restart production after taking steps that include “deep cleaning, sanitation, hygienic restoration\" and other procedures. The company operates 26 sites in the U.S. and Canada that make private brand foods and beverages, according to its website. No other plants were affected, officials said. Listeria infections can cause mild illness including fever and diarrhea or more serious problems. The illness is most dangerous to pregnant women, newborns, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Symptoms can take up to 10 weeks to appear. The CDC estimates that 1,600 people are infected with listeria each year in the United States and 260 die. This is the third large U.S. recall in recent months of foods potentially contaminated with listeria, a hardy bacteria that can be difficult to eradicate. In July, Boar's Head Provision Co. Inc. of Sarasota, Florida, recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli meat and shut down its plant in Jarratt, Virginia, after deli meat contaminated with listeria led to at least 10 deaths and nearly 50 hospitalizations. This month Oregon-based BrucePac recalled nearly 12 million pounds of meat and poultry processed at an Oklahoma plant after routine testing detected listeria.   ",

In the US, regulators have dramatically watered down plans to impose higher capital requirements on banks after the proposals sparked outrage. In the European Union, the bloc’s three biggest economies have called on leaders to pause reforms and revisit some measures that could hurt competitiveness. “It seems that, 16 years after Lehman, implementation fatigue has started to set in,” Knot told an audience at an event at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York, without calling out any particular jurisdiction’s behavior. Knot warned that financial stability could be “taken for granted” in times of calm and left to technicians to handle because “there are so many other policy priorities for governments.” “That would be a mistake,” he said, adding that financial stability is the foundation for almost all public policy. “If financial stability is gone, as a government you can forget about the other policy priorities. You will spend most of your time drawing up rescue plans for an economy in free fall.” Plans agreed but not yet implemented include the final package of post-crisis banking reforms which curb institutions’ discretion to assess how much capital they need for certain activities. There are also new packages on things like the funds industry. Knot said the agreed measures are “needed to address existing vulnerabilities — vulnerabilities that could lead to the next crisis, if they are allowed to persist.” The Dutch central banker and other regulators have spoken frequently about new risks that have emerged since the financial crisis, including the non-bank financial sector which now holds around half the global system’s assets. “The financial system is always evolving, so our policy also needs to evolve,” he said.

The food storage and kitchen products company announced the deal at a bankruptcy court hearing in Wilmington, Delaware. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon said he would quickly schedule a separate court hearing to consider approval of the sale, which was likely the best result given the company's \"difficult and challenging circumstances.\" The Orlando, Florida-based company filed for bankruptcy protection last month, with $818 million in debt and a plan to find a buyer within 30 days. But a faction of Tupperware's lenders opposed the company's sale plans, seeking instead to claim the assets for themselves. The new sale agreement will allow the lenders to purchase Tupperware's brand name and operations in multiple key markets, Tupperware attorney Spencer Winters said at the court hearing. During a court hearing last week, Tupperware argued that the lenders, which bought Tupperware's debt at a steep discount, should not be allowed to squeeze out Tupperware's other creditors and prevent them from benefiting from a sale. The lenders had argued that Tupperware's proposed auction would unfairly prevent them from using a debt exchange as part of their bid for Tupperware's assets. The new deal strikes a middle ground, giving the lenders the ability to use debt cancellation for part of the purchase price, while also requiring them to put up some cash that Tupperware can use to pay other debts. The lenders now poised to acquire Tupperware include Alden Global Capital, Stonehill Institutional Partners and a trading desk of Bank of America. Tupperware's popularity exploded in the 1950s as women of the post-war generation held \"Tupperware parties\" at their homes to sell the containers as they sought empowerment and independence. But the company said it relied too much on independent sales representatives in recent years, suffering a years-long slump in sales while missing out on opportunities to sell products online or in retail stores.

Tesla shares are down approximately 9% since Tesla revealed its robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, at its showy “We, Robot” event from the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, Calif., on Oct. 10. For the third quarter, Tesla is expected to report revenue of $25.42 billion, per Bloomberg consensus, higher than the $25.05 billion it reported in Q2 and also topping the $23.40 billion Tesla reported a year ago. The Street expects Tesla to post adjusted EPS of $0.51, on adjusted net income of $2.06 billion, and operating profit of $1.96 billion, per Bloomberg. Earlier this month, Tesla (TSLA) announced third quarter deliveries that slightly missed expectations, sending the stock lower. Tesla said it delivered 462,890 vehicles in Q3, up 6.4% quarter over quarter, to mark the first quarter of delivery growth this year. The numbers also came in ahead of the 435,059 EVs the company delivered in the year-ago period. But Wall Street had expected Tesla to deliver closer to 463,897, according to Bloomberg. The debut and release of a cheaper EV is what many analysts and industry watchers believe will spur the next leg higher of EV sales, as even CEO Elon Musk has said before. During its Q2 report, Tesla and Musk said the company remains on track for the production of new vehicles, likely including a cheaper EV, in the first half of next year. Investors and analysts were left wanting more details from Tesla’s “We, Robot” event on the Cybercab itself and detailed testing plans, along with questions about the development of Tesla’s sub-$30,000 EV, dubbed the Model 2. “Overall, we found Tesla’s Robotaxi event to be underwhelming and stunningly absent on detail,” wrote Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi the day after the event. “While Musk articulated his vision for an autonomous world, it offered little beyond what he has articulated repeatedly over the last few years.“ Sacconaghi complained that details on new product offerings like the Cybercab and Robovan autonomous van and timeframes were missing. The analyst also felt Tesla would have a hard time leapfrogging other robotaxi competitors — such as Waymo and Cruise — for regulatory and technical reasons. In addition, the lack of any details or even a rendering of the Model 2 was also a disappointment. Tesla may show a rendering of that cheaper EV in its third quarter shareholder deck in lieu of actually demonstrating it to investors and the public at an event (or tease another launch event in the near future).

That gap creates the risk of another potential round of volatility on global markets similar to the rattling August selloff. “We worry there is a tension between the kind of optimism in markets and the level of valuations in markets” and “the geopolitical backdrop” within and across countries “that could give rise to further shocks,” Tobias Adrian, director of the fund’s monetary and capital markets department, said in an interview. The Nov. 5 vote in the US represents a wildcard for markets and for economic watchdogs like the IMF, given the size of the economy and the direct impact US policies could have on global finance and trade. Adrian pointed to tariff and industrial policies, as well as potential retaliation, as among the risks. Trump has threatened sweeping new tariffs on imports from China, and across-the-board charges on other trade partners too. The IMF warnings over market risk from geopolitical shocks are a contrast with its view of the broader economic picture, which looks more sanguine. The fund slightly lowered its global growth forecast for next year in a separate report Tuesday and warned that downside risks are building, but it still sees the world economy on track for a so-called soft landing. The financial stability report flagged risks including rising debt levels, as well as world politics. “Accommodative financial conditions that keep near-term risks at bay also facilitate the buildup of vulnerabilities — such as lofty asset valuations, the global rise in private and government debt, and increased use of leverage by non-bank financial institutions — which raises risks to financial stability in the future,” the IMF study said. It pointed to the August episode, when expected divergence between US and Japanese monetary policy triggered an unwinding of the yen carry trade, which sent Japanese stocks tumbling and reverberated through global markets.

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A film production company that helped make “Blade Runner 2049” has sued Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk for using an AI-generated image resembling a scene from the science fiction movie to market Tesla's new robotaxis. Alcon Entertainment said it refused all permissions but Tesla allegedly used artificial intelligence to “do it all anyway” when the carmaker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Oct. 10 during a live-streamed event at a Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, California. After pulling up to the stage in one of the company’s “Cybercabs,” Musk gave a speech that included a brief reference to the movie franchise. As he spoke, a screen showed an image of a man in a long coat looking over an orange-tinted ruined city. Alcon claims it resembles a key scene in which star Ryan Gosling arrives by “quasi-sentient flying car” to an abandoned Las Vegas. “I love Blade Runner, but I don’t know if we want that future,\" Musk said. \"I think we want that duster he’s wearing, but not the bleak apocalypse.” A copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Alcon this week in a Southern California federal court alleges that defendants had asked permission to use images from the movie “mere hours” before the event but Alcon “refused all permissions and adamantly objected.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Alcon is also suing Warner Bros, the movie's distributor that hosted Musk's robotaxi event. Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Alcon, which is working on a spinoff “Blade Runner 2099” series for Amazon, said it is in talks with automakers about brand collaborations but has avoided affiliating with Tesla because of Musk's “extreme political and social views” and his “massively amplified, highly politicized, capricious and arbitrary behavior, which sometimes veers into hate speech.” ",

The fund’s total return was 0.1 percentage points lower than that of the benchmark against which it measures itself, reflecting underperformance by both internal and external equity managers during the quarter, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Trond Grande said in an interview. US equities advanced in the third quarter supported by improved economic data, including softer inflation figures. Widespread anticipation that the Federal Reserve would start easing monetary policy also spurred a shift out of big-tech stocks and into those likely to benefit from lower interest rates and a growing economy. While investors will be closely following the outcome of the US election, “we don’t see that as a major kind of event for markets either way,” Grande said. “We have to be mindful, at least for us as investors, that we now have a fund that is up 13.4% year to date. Our equities are up almost 18%. So it’s a really, really good year. I don’t think we should necessarily hope for that much for the rest of the year.” The underperfomance of the equity managers relative to the benchmark in the three months through August is a change compared to the first two quarters, Grande said. Year-to-date external managers are ahead of the benchmark, while their counterparts internally are at break-even, he said. “Whenever you have draw-downs you want to reassess and look at your process,” the executive said. “It was kind of broad based and that makes you think that it’s something systematic. But we haven’t really uncovered that in our analysis. It seems to be more idiosyncratic.” For the second quarter in a row, real estate weighed on returns. The fund gained 0.8% on its unlisted real estate holdings and 10.8% on unlisted renewable-energy infrastructure. Created in the 1990s to invest Norway’s oil and gas revenues abroad, the fund is largely an index tracker. It invests according to a strict mandate from the Finance Ministry, measuring itself against a bespoke benchmark index based on the FTSE Global All Cap Index for equities and Bloomberg Barclays indexes for fixed income. The bulk of NBIM’s capital is in publicly listed equities.          "

George Tung emphasized that institutional interest in bitcoin and ethereum remains strong, with inflows accelerating as the market improves. \"Last week was definitely a very good week. We saw IBIT alone take in over a billion dollars,\" Tung noted, highlighting the substantial inflows that occurred in a single week. The week marked the strongest for crypto investment products since back in July. When Melker brought up the possibility that U.S. elections, particularly Trump's increasing chances in predictive markets, might be driving some of this interest, Tung was uncertain. \"I don’t know which candidate actually will do better for the market,\" Tung stated, though he mentioned a fascinating statistic from prior election cycles where bitcoin saw significant gains leading up to the election.

The agreement could be signed this week, nearly nine years after the 2015 disaster in the city of Mariana in southeastern Brazil that killed 19 people, left hundreds homeless, flooded forests and polluted the length of the Doce River. Under the deal, the mining companies will pay 100 billion reais over 20 years to enable authorities to carry out a series of projects and measures to repair and compensate for the disaster. The companies also will still have 32 billion reais in obligations to fulfill, including individual compensation to people affected by the disaster and environment recovery initiatives. The total 170 billion reais in compensation includes 38 billion already paid by the mining companies since the dam collapse. The agreement does not eliminate the possibility of new lawsuits related to damages that are still unknown today, should their connection with the dam rupture be proven at some point in the future, one of the sources said on condition of anonymity. Still, the deal is expected to eliminate more than a hundred public civil actions against the miners in Brazil, and the companies expect that individual requests related to the Mariana disaster will be met in full by 2025, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. The mining companies also hope that the class action lawsuits filed in London and the Netherlands will dry up following the final deal, the sources told Reuters. \"The main argument that the English used in their action when they started suing BHP is that in Brazil there is no resolution for this type of problem and that is why they needed to do it in England. This agreement proves exactly the opposite and therefore significantly weakens England's case,\" one of the sources told Reuters. Another source said that, either way, the cases abroad put pressure on the companies in Brazil, which ended up accepting a much higher amount in the final deal than they were initially willing to pay. ENGLISH CASE Law firm Pogust Goodhead is leading one of the biggest court cases in British legal history in London to determine whether BHP is liable. The case entered a decisive stage on Monday with the start of a 12-week trial.        "

The track record here is not great,\" said Jeffrey Smith, speaking at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York. Smith is also Starboard's chief investment officer. Starboard has built a $1 billion position in Pfizer, but had not previously detailed its concerns about the drugmaker. Smith met with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla last week, some days after the hedge fund's campaign at the company became public. Investors have fled Pfizer as pandemic worries declined and billions of dollars in COVID-19 vaccine and treatment sales disappeared. Pfizer shares were down 0.5% at $28.80 in late morning trading on Tuesday. The company's stock is trading at about half its pandemic-era high. A Pfizer spokesperson declined to comment on Smith's presentation. Smith argued that Pfizer has lost value because of poor capital allocation, research and development failures and problems with forecasting and budgeting. Beyond the loss of COVID-19 revenue, Pfizer has also had to contend in recent quarters with disappointing data for a closely watched experimental obesity drug, the weak launch of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, and pulling its sickle cell disease treatment Oxbryta due to deaths in its clinical trials. Smith did not make any specific prescriptions for Pfizer or its management at the presentation. In an interview on CNBC, he said a change at the top of the company could make sense, but stopped short of calling for Bourla to step down. \"Something material needs to change. They can't just close their eyes and assume it's going to get better,\" he said. Starboard's campaign got off to an unusual start. Two former Pfizer executives had indicated they were working with Starboard to press for changes at Pfizer but then reversed course and said they supported the company's current CEO, Bourla.

Dye & Durham, which provides software and services to the legal and banking sectors, went on an acquisition spree after an initial public offering in 2020.

Representatives for Dye & Durham declined to comment. The shares, which briefly traded above C$50 in 2021, closed Monday at C$16.90, giving the company a market value of C$1.13 billion. Revenue in the fiscal year ended June 30 totaled C$457.7 million. Last year, the firm hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. to advise it on a potential sale of noncore assets, including its financial services division.

The first woman to occupy the role in the bank's 160-year history, she has observed at close quarters the challenges HSBC faces under new CEO Georges Elhedery, as it navigates a new interest rate cycle and a more fractious relationship between China and the West. Indian-born Kaur, 60, joined HSBC from Deutsche Bank in April 2013, rising to the role of group chief risk and compliance officer before landing her latest promotion in a sweeping revamp announced on Tuesday. Prior to HSBC, Kaur held senior risk and audit positions at Citi and Lloyds Banking Group before a crisis-era stint at bailed-out UK lender Royal Bank of Scotland. Posts on professional networking platform LinkedIn offer a glimpse into Kaur's likely management style, with courage and confidence described as staples of successful leadership under a \"Power of Chi\" management framework she has promoted to more than 10,000 followers. She will need all the chi, or positive energy, she can muster as global lenders like HSBC struggle to insulate strategies from geopolitics, contain the spiralling costs of doing business while also tapping into new sources of revenue. \"I'm not sure you could actually find a greater collection of banks that have been through the fiery furnaces of issues, and she's been in finance, in audit or in risk in all of them,\" said one former co-worker, commenting on Kaur's rich experience. \"You never want anyone in a senior position seeing bad stuff for the first time. You need someone who's actually been around, who has faced live bullets before they go into battle,\" the person said. Kaur is expected to maintain a relatively low public profile as CFO, affording the newly-installed CEO Elhdedery space to focus on client-facing activities including winning greater business from HSBC's corporate customers, sources said. However, the London-based executive, who holds an MBA from India's Panjab University will be no pushover when it comes to devising strategy, the sources said, and will bring her extensive experience to bear on HSBC's future direction. Elhedery said Tuesday's reorganisation would help unleash the lender's full potential, although analysts said it lacked detail about savings and stoked debate about the changes he and Kaur might pursue next.

        "body": "(Reuters) - The global transition toward electric vehicles will have \"far-reaching\" impacts on investment, production, international trade and employment, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday as part of its update to global economic growth forecasts. The analysis was included in the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook, which was released as policymakers meet at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings this week to discuss efforts to boost global growth, deal with debt distress and finance the green energy transition. \"The rising adoption of electric vehicles represents a fundamental transformation of the global automotive industry. It will have far-reaching consequences,\" the IMF said. The move toward EVs has accelerated in recent years and is seen as a key way to help countries achieve climate goals. In 2022, transportation accounted for 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., 21% in the European Union, and 8% in China, the IMF said. Rising adoption of EVs has been supported by the EU's goal of reducing emissions from cars by 50% for the 2030-2035 period from 2021 levels, while the U.S. government has provided subsidies for EVs and charging stations. The IMF noted that the global automotive industry stands out for having high wages, strong profits, large export markets and using a high degree of technology. The acceleration toward EVs would remake that landscape, particularly if China maintains its current edge in production and exports against U.S. and European rivals. Under realistic EV market penetration scenarios, Europe's GDP would be reduced by about 0.3% in the medium term, the IMF said. \"In these scenarios, employment declines in the automotive sector, and labor reallocates gradually to less capital-intensive sectors (with lower value added per worker),\" the IMF said. Both the U.S. and EU have imposed tariffs on Chinese-made EVs to counter what they say are unfair subsidies from Beijing to Chinese manufacturers. Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration introduced a 100% duty on Chinese EVs, while earlier this month EU member states narrowly backed import duties on Chinese-made EVs of up to 45%. Chinese EV makers have so far priced their vehicles below their rivals, a crucial advantage given EVs currently remain more expensive than gasoline alternatives and demand has been weakening for EVs globally. The French government said earlier this month it would reduce its support for EV buyers, joining Germany, which ended its subsidy scheme late last year.

Adjusted earnings this year will be $11.90 to $12.10 per share, the company said in a filing Tuesday, up from a prior view of $11 to $11.40. A consensus of analyst estimates called for $11.71 per share. Transactional revenue from the firm’s debt rating business grew 70% from the prior-year period, buoyed by heightened issuance from infrequent borrowers across all lines of business and several jumbo deals, the firm said. Revenue from rated investment-grade issuance increased the most, by 137% while revenue from junk and leveraged loans grew by 111% and 46% respectively. A rally that has driven the stock up around 20% this year took a breather Tuesday as shares fell around 3.46% in New York trading. The stock hit an all-time high last month. Moody’s “had a strong run into the quarter given issuance resilience,” wrote Jeffrey Silber, a BMO analyst. Borrowers across the globe seized on declining interest rates and strong investor demand to borrow over $600 billion last month, making it the busiest September in more than two decades. More companies are expected to raise funds after reporting third-quarter earnings to get ahead of any potentially volatility that may result from US elections in two weeks.

Global benchmark Brent climbed above $76 a barrel. The conflict in the Middle East has continued even as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday in another attempt to engineer a cease-fire — possibly the Biden administration’s last chance to secure a deal before the US presidential election. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike near one of the capital’s main government-run health facilities killed 13 people, including a child, and wounded 57 others. “We’re seeing a constant push-pull between expectations of a cease-fire — which would unwind the geopolitical risk premium — and concerns over potential escalation,” said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Group. “This environment remains highly volatile, with traders operating under low risk thresholds, contributing to significant price swings.” Crude has been buffeted this month — with Brent fluctuating in a range of more than $11 — as the war in the Middle East raises the potential for disruptions to supplies. At the same time, top importer China has moved to support growth with stimulus, but investors remain wary that the global oil market may swing to a surplus in the coming quarters. “Assuming no supply disruptions in the Middle East, the oil balance looks increasingly comfortable through 2025,” ING analysts Ewa Manthey and Warren Patterson wrote in a note. “With the market returning to a sizable surplus, we should at least see the front end of the curve moving into contango,” they said, referring to the market structure which indicates oversupply.

        "body": "Walmart (WMT) announced Tuesday it will offer same-day prescription delivery services in six states, with a plan to roll out to all 49 states in which it operates a pharmacy in by January. The first six states are Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. North Dakota is the only state where Walmart doesn't operate a pharmacy. The move brings Walmart into the competitive field of online pharmacies and same-day retail deliveries, with players like Amazon (AMZN) Pharmacy, Walgreens (WBA), and CVS (CVS). The new service is being integrated into the existing Walmart delivery service, where patients can add their prescription to their cart along with other items — a key differentiator, according to Walmart — and schedule a delivery time. It will apply any new or existing prescriptions and insurance coverage as if the patient were coming to the store to pick it up, Walmart said in its announcement. But there are a few restrictions. Controlled substances, those that need refrigeration, and Medicare Part B items will not be eligible for delivery. Competitors offer delivery in as little as two hours in some markets. Walgreens, for example, offers same-day delivery in a majority of its 8,700 stores and delivery within two hours in about 800 stores. It also has restrictions for controlled substances, temperature-controlled medicines, and other insurance-based or state regulation-based restrictions. To that end, Walmart is working on ramping up its service to include on-demand delivery \"within hours\" and an express service delivering in as soon as 30 minutes. The current iteration will be free to Walmart+ members, and the standard $9.95 delivery charge will apply to others. It is unclear if there will be additional fees for the faster delivery options. \"By combining Pharmacy Delivery into a single order, we're strengthening our commitment to providing everything they need, whenever and wherever (customers) need it,\" Tom Ward, executive vice president and chief eCommerce officer, said in a statement. Walmart said it launched the new service after a recent survey showed that 55% of customers \"expressed a desire to have their prescriptions delivered along with their groceries and other items they need in a single online order.\" Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

Still, Governor Andrew Bailey said regulators have already realized there’s a need for further tools to monitor these players. “It is more in the way of a flow test – simulate shocks, let them flow through the system and see what happens,” Bailey said in prepared remarks at Bloomberg’s Global Regulatory Forum in New York. “We need to develop more of these tools of surveillance of risks.” The system-wide exploratory scenario was designed to improve the central bank’s understanding of how banks and non-banks behave in stressed conditions. At the heart of regulators’ concern is a shift in risk-taking from banks to non-banks since the global financial crisis. Bailey said the central bank will reveal the results of the latest exercise by the end of the year. “It’s an opaque and highly disparate world,” Bailey said. “The banking world challenges us but it is actually much more homogeneous, so we have to have these tools that say how do these rather disparate and opaque pieces fit together.” As parts of its efforts to tame risks in the non-bank financial sector — a group that now accounts for roughly half the world’s financial assets — the Bank of England has already announced plans for a liquidity facility that non-banks can access. Bailey called on other central banks around the world to follow suit. “To avoid a systemic crisis, and reflecting the growth of the non-bank sector, central banks should consider permanent emergency facilities for non-banks,” Bailey said. The test scenario incorporated many elements from recent market events, including the shock tied to liability-driven investments in 2022. When gilt prices collapsed in the wake of then-Prime Minister Liz Truss’s historic tax-cutting plan, pension fund managers using LDIs faced margin calls. The central bank ultimately stepped in to stabilize the market.         "

        "body": "In a pitch to investors last spring, Anthropic said it intended to build AI to power virtual assistants that could perform research, answer emails, and handle other back-office jobs on their own. The company referred to this as a \"next-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching\" — one it believed that could, if all goes according to plan, automate large portions of the economy someday. It took a while, but that AI is starting to arrive. Anthropic on Tuesday released an upgraded version of its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model that can understand and interact with any desktop app. Via a new \"Computer Use\" API, now in open beta, the model can imitate keystrokes, button clicks, and mouse gestures, essentially emulating a person sitting at a PC. \"We trained Claude to see what’s happening on a screen and then use the software tools available to carry out tasks,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \"When a developer tasks Claude with using a piece of computer software and gives it the necessary access, Claude looks at screenshots of what’s visible to the user, then counts how many pixels vertically or horizontally it needs to move a cursor in order to click in the correct place.\" Developers can try out Computer Use via Anthropic's API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. The new 3.5 Sonnet without Computer Use is rolling out to Claude apps, and brings various performance improvements over the outgoing 3.5 Sonnet model. A tool that can automate tasks on a PC is hardly a novel idea. Countless companies offer such tools, from decades-old RPA vendors to newer upstarts like Relay, Induced AI, and Automat. In the race to develop so-called \"AI agents,\" the field has only become more crowded. AI agents remains an ill-defined term, but it generally refers to AI that can automate software. Some analysts say AI agents could provide companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars that they're pouring into AI. Companies seem to agree: According to a recent Capgemini survey, 10% of organizations already use AI agents and 82% will integrate them within the next three years. Salesforce made splashy announcements about its AI agent tech this summer, while Microsoft touted new tools for building AI agents yesterday. OpenAI, which is plotting its own brand of AI agents, sees the tech as a step toward super-intelligent AI. Anthropic calls its take on the AI agent concept an \"action-execution layer\" that lets the new 3.5 Sonnet perform desktop-level commands. Thanks to its ability to browse the web (not a first for AI models, but a first for Anthropic), 3.5 Sonnet can use any website and any application.                            "

Investors and analysts expect a series of consecutive cuts until the deposit rate – currently at 3.25% — reaches 2% or even lower in mid-2025. Money markets firmed bets on a half-point interest-rate reduction in December, lifting the possibility to 28% from around 20% on Monday. Looking further ahead, views remain almost evenly split between five or six 25-basis-point cuts by the end of next year. In a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Centeno said that he sees “monetary policy as continuing this gradual, but steady, predictable path toward more neutral level for the interest rate.” He stressed that such a neutral rate might be “at 2% or slightly below 2%,” and that the current policy rate “is still way above this neutral level, so this process is to continue.” Speaking separately to Bloomberg Television’s Francine Lacqua, President Christine Lagarde dodged the topic of half-point moves saying she didn’t want to speculate. Centeno, one of the ECB’s most dovish officials, said that inflation will see an uptick in the next months, he expects it only slightly above the 2% target in coming quarters. “I see more risks in undershooting target inflation than the other way around,” he said. --With assistance from James Hirai, Bastian Benrath-Wright, Alexander Weber and Craig Stirling.

Dhawan’s $4.5 billion Emerging Markets Bond Fund has delivered 23% returns in the past year, beating more than 90% of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The case for EM debt should not be anchored on spreads, yields, or some other valuation metric. It should be based primarily on diversification benefits,” they wrote. “Many investors today use EM debt for the wrong reasons, manage it imprudently, or overlook the best parts.” Debt from developing nations has seen a third year of outflows due to tight global financing conditions and geopolitical conflicts. This year, debt from high yielders has handed investors a 12.5% return — led by countries like Argentina and Bolivia — compared to returns of 3.5% for high-grade EM credits, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index. Once-booming economic growth in emerging markets has slowed, leading Dhawan and Story to focus more on global factors when evaluating the assets class. Some investors have already turned cautious ahead of the US vote, with JPMorgan’s global head of research Joyce Chang recommending a neutral approach to emerging markets on election risks. On the political front, Dhawan and Story said a bottom-up strategy is needed to evaluate risks in the developing world. They’re steering clear of the type of top-down analysis that focuses on harnessing excess yield, which has predominated the approach many took starting two decades ago. “Investors who were leaning into risk and trying to time the market around macro events started to play a loser’s game,” they wrote. “EM often rewards investors who minimize losses rather than maximize gains, and who avoid concentrated positions in high-yielding countries.”        "

GM CFO Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday the company is eyeing $2 billion to $4 billion of additional improvements in its EV profitability in 2025. This comes as the company is finally gaining traction in its electric vehicle business after years of investment, due to some cost rationalization and assistance from government tax credits. The company said it delivered 32,000 EVs in the third quarter. Popular sellers included the new Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EV crossovers. For 2024, GM said it will produce and wholesale 200,000 EVs. Jacobson reaffirmed a target of hitting \"positive variable profits\" for the EV division this year. Next year, GM will roll out new EVs such as the Cadillac Optiq and the redesigned Bolt. The auto giant once again surprised the Street with its performance and outlook. GM reported third quarter sales rose 10.5% year over year to $48.8 billion, besting analyst estimates for $44.6 billion. The company called out success with pickup trucks such as the Silverado and Sierra, and crossovers like the Trax. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.96 improved 29.8% versus a year ago, well ahead of consensus forecasts for $2.43. Earnings were in part fueled by GM's ongoing aggressive share repurchase activity — in the quarter it reduced its share count by 19% from the prior year. Jacobson said GM will continue to execute share repurchases in 2025 to win over skeptics on the stock. GM stock was up 2% in early trading. The company hiked its annual profit forecast. GM sees full-year adjusted earnings of $10 to $10.50 a share. Previously, it had modeled $9.50 to $10.50 a share. \"We believe this was a large step in the right direction as management continues to navigate the choppy waters and ultimately, was a long-awaited turnaround for the GM story proving testament to GM’s performance following its goals to balance production and profitability,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a client note.

The United Auto Workers has threatened strikes over Stellantis delays in the planned Belvidere investment, which has prompted Stellantis to file suits to prevent work stoppages. Asked about the delay, Granholm said \"there's a whole array of considerations with respect to that and we are in conversation about it.\" Earlier this month, UAW President Shawn Fain said hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs were at stake if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the Nov. 5 election and made good on his threat to repeal investments in electric vehicles. Trump says EV production threatens U.S. jobs. Democrats have seized on Trump's running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, declining to commit to maintaining the $500 million GM grant. A GM spokesperson said it is \"still in the negotiation phase of the grant\" and declined to forecast what might happen if the grant was not approved. Stellantis did not immediately comment. GM shares were up 9.7% Tuesday afternoon, while Stellantis shares were up 0.5%. Granholm at the conference said President Joe Biden's industrial strategy to ensure next-generation vehicle production was stronger than prior efforts. \"This time, the United States government is not effing around,\" she said. The Biden administration is helping automakers \"cut costs and secure supply chains and innovate new technologies and help you be globally competitive,\" Granholm said. \"We are not just bringing a knife to a gunfight. We are bringing an armada now.\" Granholm said government has a key role.   "

Legion's involvement comes several months after Anson Funds Management built its stake and began urging the company to consider a sale, Reuters reported in July. In addition to pushing for one board seat, Legion wants the company to cut costs, the sources said. The firm is run by Christopher Kiper. A representative for Five9 declined to comment. Reuters could not determine the size of the stake. The activists got involved after Zoom Video Communications -- whose $15 billion deal to buy Five9 was rejected by shareholders in 2021 -- made another bid last December. The two did not reach a deal. Five9's share price has been under pressure. On Tuesday, the stock traded at $30.41, down roughly 60% this year. The company is valued at $2.3 billion.

        "body": "Surgery schedules around the country may be washed out for several more weeks while a crucial IV and sterile fluids factory remains shut down for hurricane-related damage. People often plan non-emergency surgeries in the fall and early-winter months when their insurance coverage will pick up more of the bill, but they may have to wait while health systems preserve supplies for emergencies. “It’s not great for patients, but it’s kind of doing the most good with what you have,” said Erin Fox, associate chief pharmacy officer at University of Utah Health. The federal government and medical suppliers have taken several steps to help ease the supply crunch created by Hurricane Helene, which forced Baxter International (BAX) to close its North Carolina plant late last month. But experts say supplies are still choppy, and improvements will take time. Here’s a closer look the situation. Baxter’s North Cove, North Carolina, location makes about 60% of the intravenous solutions used in the U.S. every day, according to the American Hospital Association. It also makes fluids used by patients on home dialysis and sterile water used to clean patient surgery sites during operations. But flooding triggered by the storm washed out bridges nearby and water came into the factory, forcing the shutdown. Baxter says the site sustained no structural damage. Health systems started conserving fluids shortly after the plant shut down. Some switched patients who can drink fluids to Gatorade or water instead of giving them an IV. Hospitals also have started postponing planned procedures that can wait, like some orthopedic surgeries or heart procedures, said Dr. Chris DeRienzo, chief physician executive for the American Hospital Association. Baxter has limited the fluids supplies it sends to distributors and health systems. The impact on a patient will depend partly on how heavily a hospital or health system relies on Baxter, said Nancy Foster, a vice president with the hospital association. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved temporarily importing fluids from Baxter plants in several countries. The company also has already started easing some of the limits it had placed on supplies. Baxter rival B. Braun Medical has increased production at its Daytona Beach, Florida, site, which escaped damage from another hurricane, and at a location in California. The FDA also issued new temporary guidelines designed to make it easier for compounding pharmacies to produce certain IV drugs that are in short supply.            ",

        "body": "By Kenrick Cai and Jeffrey Dastin SAN FRANCISCO - Anthropic, a startup backed by Alphabet and Amazon.com, released a pair of updated artificial intelligence models on Tuesday, along with a new capability to autonomously perform computer tasks and save users keystrokes. The new \"computer use\" feature can tell AI \"where to move the mouse, where to click, what to type, in order to do quite complicated tasks,\" Anthropic's Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan said in an interview. The capability is tailored to software developers and represents a move toward AI agents, programs that require little human intervention to carry out multi-step actions. Researchers have touted agents as a frontier for AI development beyond chatbots, which easily conjure prose or computer code though not actions. Anthropic demonstrated a use case for the feature that entailed coding a basic website, and another that used various programs including Google Search and Apple Maps to plan a sunrise outing. Anthropic offers software developers three versions of Claude, its family of AI models, at price points that vary based on their performance. This week's updates come to Sonnet, the mid-tier model, and Haiku, the cheapest. The new 3.5 Haiku can generate computer code in a manner \"almost comparable\" to the version of Sonnet released in June, according to Kaplan. CEO Dario Amodei told Reuters at the time that the company intended to update Opus, the most capable model, by the end of the year. The computer use feature is currently limited to the new version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and comes with safeguards to prevent its application toward spam, fraud and election-related misuse, Anthropic said. Kaplan said the AI still makes mistakes. Mike Krieger, a co-founder of Instagram who joined Anthropic this spring as chief product officer, said the company wants feedback from business customers to learn where to focus development of the feature. Meanwhile, a labs team inside Anthropic is exploring how to make the capability available for consumers, something Krieger said he personally wants. \"I was booking flights,\" he said. \"I really just want this to be completely automated.\" Microsoft on Monday unveiled an application for its clients to build their own agents that can handle queries, identify sales leads and manage inventory.

        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. railroad operator Norfolk Southern reported third-quarter profit and revenue above Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, helped by strength in its merchandise and intermodal segments. Shares of the company rose 3.6% in early trading. Improving intermodal volumes, higher-than-inflation pricing and a better operating ratio have helped the railroad shield profitability even as the freight industry continues to go through a downturn. Atalanta, Georgia-based Norfolk Southern reported an adjusted operating ratio of 63.4%, representing a 570 basis point improvement from a year ago. The ratio is a keenly watched metric that indicates operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. A higher operating ratio reflects an increase in costs. Severe weather events in the quarter posed service challenges at railroads to which the company has responded positively, displaying operating ratio improvement and positioning itself better to capture volumes off highway. \"Our team drove productivity and grew volumes while demonstrating resiliency in dealing with weather challenges,\" CEO Mark George, who took over the top job in September, said in a statement. \"We delivered sequential and year-over-year margin improvement putting us on track to achieve our adjusted operating ratio targets for the second half and full year 2024,\" he added. The company reported operating revenue of $3.1 billion for the third quarter, rising 3% from the previous year, beating analysts' estimates of $3.08 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. During the quarter, the company closed two railway line sales, resulting in cash proceeds of nearly $400 million and gains of $380 million, it said. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a profit of $3.25 per share, above analysts' estimates of $3.11. (Reporting by Abhinav Parmar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel) ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance The new regulations, which come more than a year after the initial proposed rules, mean that a wider swath of companies will be able to get the tax breaks. That includes businesses that produce the wafers that are ultimately turned into semiconductors, as well as manufacturers of chips and chipmaking equipment. The credits also will apply to solar wafers — an unexpected shift that could help spur domestic production of panel components. So far, the US has struggled to foster manufacturing of those parts, despite a surge of investment in US panel-making factories. But the benefits don’t extend all the way up the supply chain. Still excluded are facilities that produce underlying materials like polysilicon, which is used to make wafers. That approach is consistent with how the original law was written, as well as how the Commerce Department defines semiconductors and equipment as opposed to materials, a Treasury official said. The tax refunds are one of three main subsidy streams available from the Chips Act, which aims to revitalize the American semiconductor industry after decades of production shifting abroad. The law also set aside $39 billion in grant funding — more than 90% of which has been allocated, though not yet spent — and $75 billion in loans and loan guarantees, of which officials are likely to use less than half. The latter two incentive categories have garnered the most attention — President Joe Biden has even visited factories to herald the announcements — but it’s the tax credits that could be most meaningful for companies. Proposed grants typically cover 10% to 15% of project costs, compared with 25% for tax credits. The idea is to make it just as cost-effective to build a factory in the US as in Asia. “Our goal is to give you the minimum amount of money necessary to get you to expand on our shores in a way that advances our economic and national security objectives,” Mike Schmidt, director of the Commerce Department’s chips office, said in an August interview when asked about tax credits. “That means looking at all sources of funding and then figuring out how our funds get you over that hump.”                     "

The so-called \"seed house\" used an Atenea-UBB printer and a KUKA KR120 industrial robot to rapidly create the compact home, pouring layer upon layer of concrete to build the walls in just 29 hours. It then took two days to piece together. \"Casa Semilla has seven walls made from printed concrete and covers an area of some 30 square meters,\" said Claudia Muñoz, an academic at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Biobío, which this month presented the finished home. \"We print these industrialized walls entirely in our lab.\" Rodrigo García, another member of the university's Manufacturing in Construction Group, said the technology could help change how construction was done, using flexible building models, even if there's plenty left to be proven about cost and reliability. \"This is a very revolutionary technology because it changes the traditional way of building, where plans are made, products are quoted, a large number of elements have to be purchased and the land prepared, which is time-consuming,\" he said. The house was put up in the Torreones neighborhood of Concepción on land belonging to a private construction company, which got involved with the project. The concept could, if successful, spur thinking about the construction sector. \"We have many housing demands in Latin America and we are used to importing things,\" added Garcia. \"This is a complex change to adopt, which has to be adapted to our Chilean reality rooted in earthquakes, to our variety of climate.\" (Reporting by Reuters TV and Fabian Cambero; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Hugh Lawson) "

While the IMF significantly raised its 2024 growth forecast for Brazil to 3.0%, up from 2.1% in July, it noted in its updated World Economic Outlook that Mexico's economy is expected to expand 1.5%, seven-tenths of a percentage point less than previously estimated. The contrasting momentum of the two countries have led to different inflation scenarios, with Brazil, the region's largest economy, expected to keep tightening monetary policy to curb rising prices, while Mexico moves towards lowering rates. The IMF attributed Brazil's improved outlook to stronger private consumption and investment in the first half of the year, fueled by a tight labor market, government transfers, and a less-than-expected disruption from floods earlier this year. As for Mexico, the IMF said the revised figure reflects weakening domestic demand. Among the region's major economies, Argentina is the only one projected to contract this year, with a 3.5% decline, more than double its 1.6% drop in 2023. However, the IMF expects a strong rebound in 2025, with 5.0% growth. Overall, economic activity in Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to remain broadly stable this year compared to the 2.2% growth seen in 2023, with the IMF forecasting an acceleration to 2.5% in 2025.

It left the projection for this year unchanged at 3.2%. Inflation will slow to 4.3% next year from 5.8% in 2024. The fund has been cautioning for a couple of years that the world economy is likely to expand at its current mediocre level in the medium term — too little to give nations the resources they need to reduce poverty and confront climate change. “The risks are building up to the downside, and there is a growing uncertainty in the global economy,” Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said in a briefing. “There is geopolitical risk, with the potential for escalation of regional conflicts,” that could affect commodity markets, he said. “There is a rise of protectionism, protectionist policies, disruptions in trade that could also affect global activity.” While the outlook doesn’t explicitly mention the US election, the contest in two weeks looms over annual meetings that will see finance ministers and central bankers from almost 200 nations gather at the IMF and World Bank headquarters in Washington, just three blocks from the White House. A Bloomberg Economics analysis earlier this year found that Donald Trump’s vow to impose 60% tariffs on imports from China and 10% duties on those from the rest of the world would likely spur inflation and pressure the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. In a briefing on Tuesday, Gourinchas said that tariffs and trade uncertainty across countries risk reducing global economic output level by about 0.5% in 2026. The IMF last week flagged concern about global public debt, which is expected to reach $100 trillion, or 93% of world gross domestic product, by the end of this year. The surge is driven by the US and China. The fund is urging governments to make tough decisions to stabilize borrowing. With little political appetite to cut spending amid pressures to fund cleaner energy, support aging populations and bolster security, the “risks to the debt outlook are heavily tilted to the upside,” the IMF said.

The FAA called the rule \"the final piece in the puzzle for safely introducing these aircraft in the near term.\" Some flying companies hope to begin flying commercial passengers as soon as 2025. Low-altitude urban aircraft known as eVTOLs have drawn intense global interest, with numerous companies going public like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation. Joby shares rose 7% Tuesday, while Archer rose 3%. \"The opportunities for the use of powered lift operations are far-reaching, from transporting passengers in urban areas and short-haul operations such as air ambulance services and cargo operations to potentially serving smaller communities over time,\" the FAA said. Airlines and other companies are looking at developing transport services using battery-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically to ferry travelers to airports or for short city trips, allowing them to beat traffic. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said at a conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday the rule is designed to be flexible. The regulation has \"a performance-based approach, so you can look at fuel reserves and other things with this new technology, account for safety,\" he said. Former acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen, who is chief safety officer at Archer, said the announcement is a big milestone for the deployment of flying air taxis. \"Now we've got a roadmap,\" he told Reuters. Joby CEO JoeBen Bevirt said the rule \"will ensure the U.S. continues to play a global leadership role in the development and adoption of clean flight.\" The FAA said previously that air taxi operations will begin at a low rate, similar to helicopters, and using existing routes and infrastructure such as helipads and vertiports. The FAA said the rule allows pilots to train with a single set of flight controls while prior rules required two flight controls – for the student and instructor. Delta Air Lines invested $60 million in Joby in a partnership aiming to offer passengers air taxi transport to and from airports in New York and Los Angeles within a few years. Earlier this month, Toyota invested $500 million in Joby. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci) "

In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF raised its 2024 and 2025 economic growth forecasts for the U.S. - the only developed economy to see its outlook marked up for both years - and its chief economist said the \"soft landing\" sought by the Federal Reserve in which inflation eases without big damage to the job market had largely been achieved. Emerging market powerhouses India and Brazil also stood out on the upside of the IMF forecasts, while it dialed back growth expectations for China for this year and left next year's forecast for the world's No. 2 economy at a below-trend 4.5%. Still, it warned that risks abound from armed conflicts, potential new trade wars and the hangover from the tight monetary policy employed by the Fed and other central banks to rein in inflation. \"Today, the IMF reported that the United States is leading the advanced economies on growth for the second year in a row,\" Lael Brainard, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, said in a statement. The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook said the shifts will leave 2024 global GDP growth unchanged from the 3.2% projected by the global lender in July, setting a lackluster tone for growth as world finance leaders gather in Washington this week for the IMF and World Bank annual meetings. Global growth is projected to be 3.2% in 2025, one-tenth of a percentage point lower than forecast in July, while medium-term growth is expected to fade to a \"mediocre\" 3.1% in five years, well below its pre-pandemic trend, the report showed. Nonetheless, the IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said some countries, including the U.S., were showing resilience. \"The news on the U.S. is very good in a sense,\" Gourinchas said at a press conference in Washington. \"The labor market picture remains one that is fairly robust, even though it has cooled off.\" \"I think the risks of a recession in the U.S. in the absence of a very sharp shock would be somewhat diminished,\" he said. Although Gourinchas said it looked as if the global inflation battle had largely been won, he told Reuters in an interview there is a risk that monetary policy could \"mechanically\" become too tight without interest rate cuts in some countries as inflation subsides, weighing on growth and jobs.

Traders have flocked to the market amid a tight US presidential vote and persistent concern that violence in the Middle East may escalate into a wider war. Robust central-bank buying and expectations of US interest-rate cuts have also underpinned gold’s stellar run this year. Federal Reserve officials continue to opine on the path forward, with Jeffrey Schmid favoring a slower pace of rate reductions and Mary Daly forecasting more cuts. “Gold is one of this year’s strongest-performing commodities, with gains of more than 30% so far supported by rate-cut optimism, strong central-bank buying and robust Asian purchases,” ING Bank NV wrote in a note. “Haven demand amid heightened geopolitical risks, as well as uncertainty ahead of the US election in November, have also supported gold’s record-breaking rally.” Money managers have increased net-long positions in gold, while investors have added to holdings in exchange-traded funds. Citigroup Inc. analysts boosted their three-month price forecast by 3.7% to $2,800 an ounce amid expectations that further labor-market deterioration will drive demand. While the outcome of the US election remains uncertain, Saxo Bank A/S Head of Commodity Strategy Ole Hansen suggests gold and silver are getting caught up in bets on a Republican victory.

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Groups in Russia created and helped spread viral disinformation targeting Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, a senior U.S. intelligence official said Tuesday. The content, which includes baseless accusations about the Minnesota governor's time as a teacher, contains several indications that it was manipulated, said the official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Analysts identified clues that linked the content to Russian disinformation operations, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director. Digital researchers had already linked the video to Russia, but Tuesday’s announcement is the first time federal authorities have confirmed the connection. The disinformation targeting Walz is consistent with Russian disinformation seeking to undermine the Democratic campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz, her running mate. Russia also has spread disinformation aimed at stoking discord and division ahead of voting, officials said, and may seek to encourage violent protests after Election Day. Last month, analysts at Microsoft revealed that a viral video that baselessly claimed Harris left a woman paralyzed in a hit-and-run accident 13 years ago was Russian disinformation. More recently, a video surfaced featuring a man claiming to be a former student of Walz's who accused the candidate of sexual misconduct years ago. Private researchers at firms that track disinformation, including NewsGuard, already have concluded the video was fake and that the man in the footage isn't who he claimed to be. Some researchers have also suggested the video may contain evidence that it was created using artificial intelligence, but federal officials stopped short of the same conclusion, saying only that the video contained multiple indications of manipulation. China and Iran also have sought to influence the U.S. election using online disinformation. While Russia has targeted the Democratic campaign, Iran has gone after Republican Donald Trump with disinformation as well as hacking into the former president's campaign. China, meanwhile, has focused its influence efforts on down-ballot races, and on general efforts to sow distrust and democratic dissatisfaction. There is no indication that Russia, China or Iran are plotting significant attacks on election infrastructure as a way to disrupt the outcome, officials said Tuesday. Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has said improvements to election security mean there is no way any other foreign adversary will be able to alter the results. Russia, China and Iran have all rejected claims that they are seeking to meddle with the U.S. election. Messages left with the Russian embassy seeking comment on the Walz video were not immediately returned Tuesday. "

The large cut — which is expected by all but one of Canada’s biggest lenders — would signal some urgency to bring the benchmark overnight rate to the so-called neutral level, where it will neither slow nor stimulate the economy. With inflation now lower than the central bank’s 2% target and growth tracking well below the bank’s estimates, restrictive borrowing costs simply aren’t needed. Some analysts also worry that sticking to a gradual easing pace at this point wouldn’t be enough to keep inflation from drifting too low, or might even lead to outright deflation. “Arguably the Bank of Canada is well behind the curve,” Jason Daw, head of North American rates strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said by email. “They had to wait due to inflation uncertainties, but with price growth normalizing quickly, the economy no longer needs the current degree of restrictiveness.” In a news conference after September’s 25 basis-point cut, Macklem opened the door to the possibility of more aggressive action, saying the bank could accelerate the pace of easing if inflation and growth were weaker than expected. So far, that seems to be the case. Yearly price pressures surprisingly decelerated to a 1.6% pace last month, helped by falling gasoline prices. They’ve averaged 2% in the third quarter, below the 2.3% pace forecast in July. At that time, officials expected the economy to grow at a 2.8% annualized clip in the third quarter — preliminary data point to growth closer to 1%. Downside risks to the economy are mounting. While a recession is not the base case expectation of economists or the bank, growth has stagnated and is being propped up by record immigration levels. On average, the economy has been expanding below potential for over a year, opening the so-called output gap and helping to ease price pressures. The labor market is weakening, and while there’s no evidence of widespread layoffs, household spending is being constrained as Canadians continue to renew their mortgages at higher rates.

SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein said a significant part of cloud deals in the quarter included AI use cases. The company has doubled down on efforts to cash in on the technology in recent months, cementing new AI partnerships and expanding existing ones as it seeks to gain an edge over rivals. Advancements in generative AI sparked a wave of investments from tech companies jockeying for position in a rapidly evolving market that looks set to revolutionize the future of business and human labor. SAP last year made investments in three generative AI companies—Aleph Alpha, Anthropic and Cohere—and poached Walter Sun from Microsoft as its global head of AI. SAP said its cloud business had an outstanding performance in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, India, Japan and Spain in the third quarter, while China, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. had also been particularly robust. Reporting on a non-IFRS basis, SAP said total revenue increased 10% at constant currencies to €8.47 billion. Revenue from SAP’s core cloud business jumped 27% to €4.35 billion. Operating profit grew 28% to €2.24 billion. Analysts had forecast total revenue of €8.44 billion, cloud revenue of €4.35 billion and an operating profit of €2.07 billion, according to a non-IFRS consensus provided by the company. SAP, like other European software companies, presents its figures as two sets of numbers. One set is based on the International Financial Reporting Standards—an international accounting method that seeks to provide a global reporting standard—though analysts and investors tend to follow SAP’s non-IFRS numbers, which exclude restructuring expenses and acquisition-related charges.

The company’s Australia-Asia Power Link plans to send 1.75 gigawatts of renewable electricity to Singapore, or about 9% of its current needs, through a 4,300-kilometer (2,670-mile) submarine cable. The Australia-based project, controlled by tech billionaire Mike-Cannon Brookes, is one of the most ambitious developments globally to supply energy-hungry customers in Asia that don’t have the available land to generate enough renewable power. It won approval for its first stage in August. “Conditional approval is a vote of confidence from the Singapore government,” Mitesh Patel, SunCable International’s interim chief executive officer, said in the statement. The company now plans to focus on project planning, talks with industrial customers in Singapore and subsea surveys in Indonesia. Singapore is also holding talks with Australia and clean energy groups on plans to allow the use of credits tied to cross-border electricity imports, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said Tuesday in a statement. The nation aims to import 6 gigawatts of low-carbon power by 2035, and is working to study pathways to deliver high-integrity certificates linked to clean power generated outside of Singapore. Development of a credible framework for the credits would help lift demand for cross-border electricity trading and support investment in renewable projects across the region, the ministry said, without giving a timeline for execution of the proposals.

Jeffries, partner Matthew Smith and their employee James Jacobson ran an international sex trafficking and prostitution business from 2008 to 2015, using Jeffries’ status, wealth and a web of household staffers to fulfill the couple's sexual desires and keep it all secret, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn. “To anyone who thinks they can exploit and coerce others by using the so-called casting couch system, this case should serve as a warning – prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison,” Brooklyn-based U.S. attorney Breon Peace said at a news conference. “Sexually exploiting vulnerable human beings is a crime. And doing so by dangling dreams of a future in fashion and modeling is no different,” he added. The charges follow sexual misconduct allegations, made in lawsuits and the media, from young people who said Jeffries promised modeling work and then pressed them into sex acts. Jeffries' attorney, Brian Bieber, said by email he would “respond in detail to the allegations after the indictment is unsealed, and when appropriate, but plan to do so in the courthouse — not the media.” Messages seeking comment were sent to attorneys for Smith and Jacobson. Jeffries and Smith were arrested in Florida and were due to make an initial court appearance Tuesday afternoon in West Palm Beach. Jacobson was arrested in Wisconsin and due in court in St. Paul, Minnesota. Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace and FBI and police officials were set to hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Jeffries, Smith and Jacobson are charged with sex trafficking and interstate prostitution involving 15 unnamed accusers. According to the indictment, they paid for dozens of men to travel within the U.S. and internationally to engage in paid sex with them and other men in New York and at hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco and St. Barts. The indictment describes sexual bacchanals in which the recruited men were given drugs, lubricant, condoms, costumes, sex toys and, sometimes, erection-inducing penile injections that caused painful, hourslong reactions. The men weren't informed of all that the events would entail, including some of the sexual practices they'd be expected to engage in, and they were required to give up their clothes and cell phones during the gatherings and sign non-disclosure agreements afterward, the indictment said.

The company, which owns the Maybelline and Lancome brands, said sales for the three months to the end of September were 10.28 billion euros ($11.11 billion), a 3.4% rise on a like-for-like basis at constant exchange rates. It was below a Visible Alpha consensus of 6% cited by Jefferies. Shares in Paris-based L'Oreal have lost 20% since June, wiping about 50 billion euros off its valuation, on investor concerns about consumption in China. The North Asia region, dominated by China, accounts for a quarter of group sales, but persistently weak demand in the world's No. 2 economy has curbed consumer spending. Sales in North Asia declined 6.5% in the third quarter, said the company, worsening from a decline of 2.4% in the prior three months. \"In mainland China, the beauty market – already negative in the second quarter – continued to deteriorate, impacted by low consumer confidence,\" the company said in a statement.

The decision, based in part due to UK disclosure requirements, was a blow to London’s ambitions to be a magnet for tech companies and its status as a global financial hub. In the aftermath, the UK worked to simplify its listing rules, including allowing companies more autonomy without being subject to shareholder votes. Arm shares have risen nearly 200% since its September 2023 IPO. ‘Strange Bedfellows’ Haas called for more geographic and supplier diversity in the semiconductor industry, which is currently dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Arm relies on its sometime competitor, troubled Intel Corp., according to Haas. The pair might be “strange bedfellows,” but Arm works closely with Intel, he said. “We work very closely with their engineers to make sure that the leading-edge technology can run on Arm,” Haas said. “We want to see Intel successful.” He declined to comment on a Bloomberg News report last month that Arm sought to buy Intel’s product division. Intel, once the world’s largest chipmaker, has struggled in recent years, with its shares dropping to their lowest point since 2010 in September. That month, the firm announced plans to slash 15,000 jobs and scale back factory expansion plans. Arm makes much of its revenue selling chip designs for smartphones, although Haas has sought to broaden its reach outside of that industry.

That’s why we are focused on optimizing our ICE [internal combustion engine vehicle] margins and working to make our EVs profitable on an EBIT basis as quickly as possible.\" GM CFO Paul Jacobson added in a media call with reporters that while the reduction of GM's share count by 19% via buybacks provided a \"tailwind\" to the EPS beat, the profit beat was due more to the earnings power of the company's fundamental business. Jacobson told Yahoo Finance the company would stay aggressive on buybacks in 2025. In Q3, GM delivered 659,601 vehicles, down 2% compared with a year ago; however, retail sales were up 3%. GM said it delivered more vehicles than any other automaker in the US in the quarter. Not surprisingly, GM’s sales of pickups and full-size SUVs led the way, but electric vehicle sales were also a highlight. Amid a drop in sales for the Bolt EV, GM’s other EV models picked up the slack with sales of 32,195 EVs in total, up 60% compared to a year ago. Jacobson said at GM's investor day in early October that the company is still targeting EV profitability on a positive variable profit margin basis, despite the fact that it revised its EV production volume forecast to 200,000 units, at the low end of its previous range of 200,000 to 250,000 units. The company is expecting to trim EV costs by $2 billion to $4 billion in 2025.       ",

We are actively engaged with local authorities and the due legal process to restore access to the platform, while prioritising the safety of players and developers in Türkiye.\" The Roblox ban was imposed a week after Turkey blocked access to social media platform Instagram, owned by Meta, in a move it said was due to Instagram not abiding by certain laws and public sensitivities.

This matters because eurodollar markets have played a role in deepening economic downturns across the globe, he said, including the 2008 financial crisis. “There may be more work for those of us in the global regulatory community to ensure resiliency in the offshore eurodollar markets,” Gensler said. Global upheavals have caused the US Federal Reserve to step in as the international lender of last resort to keep foreign financial firms afloat. The Fed shoveled billions of dollars into overseas banks during the Great Financial Crisis to keep the system functioning, and in 2020, it engaged in a massive buying of domestic corporate bonds to stabilize the global dollar-bond market, according to a May report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. In a separate interview with Bloomberg Television, Gensler called for global collaboration to regulate the use of artificial intelligence in finance. With AI’s capabilities increasing exponentially each month, Gensler has repeatedly warned about the potential risk that thousands of banks, brokers, investment advisers and other financial firms will all rely on just a few underlying data sets to design ultimately similar AI systems. It’s important for regulators to consider how to protect against what’s likely to be a “very concentrated interconnected system,” he said. Private Credit The SEC continues to keep a close eye on the burgeoning private credit sector, which now totals $1.7 trillion, he said. “Though private credit has existed in some form for years, given its size has increased significantly, how will it weather times of stress at today’s or greater magnitude?” he asked during the forum. Gensler acknowledged the benefits of private credit, but also highlighted potential risks of its intersection with the traditional banking and insurance sectors.             "

The jury deliberated for about two hours before handing down the verdict. Larmore faces as long as 20 years in prison for each count at sentencing on March 4, although white-collar criminals rarely receive the statutory maximum. Prosecutors alleged Larmore bought thousands of WeWork options just days before an entity he controlled, Cole Capital Funds LLC, made an offer to buy WeWork stock at $9 a share, which sent the price soaring 150% on Nov. 3. He stood to make millions of dollars on the options, but he mistimed a press release announcing the offer, and his options expired about an hour before the rally, the government said. WeWork had been the fastest-growing co-working company in the world, with millions of square feet of office space and a peak valuation of $47 billion in 2019. But by last year, slumping demand left it with more liabilities than assets. Shares that fetched more than $500 in 2021 were trading at less than $1 in early November, when the company was expected to file for bankruptcy. That’s when Larmore used Cole Capital, which had “no genuine business operations,” to make a bogus tender offer and artificially inflate the value of WeWork shares and options, the government said. Larmore’s attorneys had argued that the offer for WeWork was legitimate and that he never intended to manipulate the market. “Of course we’re disappointed with the jury’s verdict,” Bruce Udolf, one of Larmore’s attorneys, said after the verdict was read. “We respect it and we plan to appeal.” Larmore was a so-called real estate syndicator — a private investor who makes deals in commercial properties using other people’s money. It’s an often overlooked corner of the US market. In 2005, he founded ArciTerra Cos., which acquired strip malls and other retail properties in need of revamping, fixed them up and then refinanced them to raise cash.              "

Asked why that extra capacity wasn’t added in the U.S., and if the Mexico expansion was an effort to slash spending following a new agreement with the United Auto Workers union, Feuell said it was not a cost-cutting move. “The plant in Saltillo does a really good job managing the complexity and they’re already building pickup trucks down there,” she said. The future home of the Ram 1500 truck, which is currently built at Sterling Heights assembly near Detroit, is under question given the Mexico expansion. Stellantis is not currently building Ram 1500 trucks in Saltillo, Feuell said. She declined to say if they would do so in the future, following a report that the automaker was adding factory space next to the Saltillo facility for that purpose. The automaker's production plans have come under greater scrutiny as the UAW is laying the groundwork for a nationwide walkout against Stellantis, claiming it has not kept its contract promises. The company said it has kept its commitments, and has in turn sued the UAW in federal court over its allegations. Stellantis is in the midst of significant leadership changes as CEO Carlos Tavares attempts to turn around sliding sales and profit in North America ahead of his planned 2026 departure. The car company's shares are down about 44% year to date. Tavares indicated earlier this year he was ready to axe any of its 14 brands that isn't performing. Feuell said Chrysler's positioning is strong. \"Chrysler has a very well-funded product and technology roadmap,\" she said. (Reporting by Nora EckertEditing by Bill Berkrot) "

        "body": "(Reuters) -Mike Jeffries, the former chief executive of Abercrombie & Fitch, has been indicted on sex trafficking and prostitution involving dozens of men. The charges were unveiled on Tuesday, a decade after Jeffries left the retailer he built over 22 years into a popular clothing brand known for sexually charged marketing. Jeffries, his partner Matthew Smith, and a third defendant James Jacobson, who allegedly served as a recruiter, were each charged with one count of sex trafficking and 15 counts of interstate prostitution. Jeffries and Smith are expected to appear later Tuesday in federal court in Florida, court records show. All three defendants were arrested on Tuesday. Brian Bieber, a lawyer for Jeffries, said in an email he would respond in detail to the charges in court. Lawyers for Smith did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Jacobson could not immediately be reached for comment. Abercrombie declined to comment. According to the indictment, between 2008 and 2015 Jeffries and Smith paid for dozens of men to meet them for sex in New York and at hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco, Saint Barthelemy and elsewhere, in the hope it would advance their modeling careers. Relying on their \"vast\" financial resources and Jeffries' power at Abercrombie, Jeffries and Smith ran a business \"dedicated to fulfilling their sexual desires and ensuring that their international sex trafficking and prostitution business was kept secret, thereby maintaining Jeffries' powerful reputation,\" the indictment said. Prosecutors said Jacobson typically conducted \"tryouts\" where male recruits would first have sex with him. They also said the scheme involved the use of muscle relaxants known as \"poppers,\" large sex toys and high-pressured enemas, among other things. Men were also required to sign non-disclosure agreements, and pay damages if they told anyone including family and friends what went on. The probe was led by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York. Last year, a group of once-aspiring Abercrombie models sued Abercrombie, Jeffries and Smith in Manhattan federal court, saying in a proposed class action that the New Albany, Ohio-based company benefited from Jeffries' sex trafficking. David Bradberry, the named plaintiff, said Jeffries forced models to take drugs and engage in sex for a chance to appear in Abercrombie catalogs, while the company paid off people who accused Jeffries of sexual abuse or harassment. Jeffries led Abercrombie from 1992 to 2014, making it a successful teen apparel maker known for cologne-filled stores and ads featuring semi-nude models.   "

Both companies were discussing a potential majority stake sale valuing the division at about €1.5 billion ($1.62 billion), Bloomberg reported in March. Marine Systems makes submarines, surface vessels and naval electronics. Securing an investment from Carlyle would have been a welcome bright spot for Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Officer Miguel Ángel López Borrego, who’s pledged to revive the struggling industrial German conglomerate. The manufacturer has said it’s working on making the unit more independent via a sale, spinoff or initial public offering. Carlyle’s withdrawal is a setback to those plans as no alternative bidders have come forward. Thyssenkrupp shares declined as much as 3.7% in Frankfurt. The stock is down around 48% this year. “We remain convinced that the naval business can best exploit the industry’s global growth opportunities in an independent position,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Independence offers a good starting position for possible national and European consolidation.” Carlyle declined to comment.

If you are looking for more investing related content, I guarantee you’ll enjoy my content on 𝕏, @LogicalThesis. Thanks for reading! Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become a popular method for startups to raise capital in the cryptocurrency space. By issuing new digital tokens in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, projects can fund their development. Here’s a brief overview of ICOs, how they work, their benefits, and associated risks. An ICO is a fundraising mechanism where new projects sell tokens to investors in exchange for capital. These tokens can represent utility, security, or other digital assets based on blockchain technology. Project Development: A startup creates a blockchain-based project. Whitepaper Creation: The team drafts a whitepaper detailing the project’s purpose and the ICO specifics. Token Sale Launch: The ICO is announced, allowing investors to purchase tokens at a set price during a specified period. Raising Funds: Investors contribute cryptocurrencies, funding the project’s development. Post-ICO Trading: Tokens are often listed on exchanges for trading after the ICO. Access to Capital: Startups can quickly raise funds without traditional barriers. Global Reach: ICOs allow a diverse range of investors to participate. Potential Returns: Early investors may see significant gains if the project succeeds. Regulatory Issues: ICOs often lack regulation, exposing investors to scams. Market Volatility: Tokens can lose value rapidly, risking investor capital. Project Viability: Many projects fail to deliver on their promises, leading to losses. ICOs gained popularity around 2017-2018, attracting regulatory scrutiny. In response, alternatives like Security Token Offerings (STOs) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) have emerged, providing more regulated fundraising options. ICOs offer a unique opportunity for innovation and investment in the blockchain space, but they come with significant risks. Investors should conduct thorough research before participating, especially as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. Understanding ICOs and their alternatives is essential for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic market.

        "body": "US stocks slipped on Tuesday as investors digested a recent bond market sell-off and braced for the next wave of earnings reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped about 0.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were both off about 0.1%. Stocks are coming under pressure amid growing doubts that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut rates aggressively — or even hold steady in November. Strength in the economy, cautious Fedspeak, and concerns about the fiscal impact of an election win by Republican nominee Donald Trump are factors in play. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Amid the uncertainty, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) steadied around 4.2% after Monday's sharp gains helped push it above that level for the first time since July. The bond selling has weighed on rate-sensitive stocks such as real estate, with rising yields typically a catalyst for stock drawdowns. On the earnings front, General Motors (GM) raised its guidance for the third time this year as upbeat EV sales helped deliver a quarterly profit and revenue beat. GM shares were up more than 9%. Elsewhere in earnings, GE Aerospace (GE) fell over 7% and Verizon shares fell around 5% on mixed third quarter reports. At the same time, anticipation is building for earnings from Tesla (TSLA) on Wednesday as Wall Street debates whether the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech megacaps will lead stocks' next leg higher. Despite higher yields, gold (GC=F) prices rose, on track to reclaim Monday's record high. The gains came as investors sought safety with the US presidential election looming and Middle East tensions still on the rise. Energy (XLE), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Real Estate (XLRE) led Tuesday's sector action, with markets retreating for their second straight session as traders priced in a higher for longer policy stance from the Federal Reserve. Oil prices were a standout, with WTI crude (CL=F) rising about 3% to trade above $72.50 a barrel. Brent crude (BZ=F), the international benchmark, rose more than 2% to trade just above $76 a barrel. Information technology (XLI), Materials (XLB), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) served as the day's biggest laggards. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the global economy is on pace for a soft landing this year and 2025 but elections around the world introduce a \"high\" level of uncertainty to that outlook due to potential changes in trade and fiscal policy. The IMF said an increase in global tariffs could exacerbate trade tensions, disrupt global supply chains, and weigh down medium-term growth prospects by limiting positive spillovers from innovation and technology transfer that once fueled growth in emerging markets and developing economies. Read more here. Treasury yields spiked over the last month amid a slew of stronger-than-expected economic data and signs that inflation's path down toward the Fed's 2% goal may take longer than initially hoped. The data has pushed the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) up nearly 50 basis points in the past month to hover near 4.2%, its highest level since July. As our graph below shows, the debate among investors appears to be more about how quickly the Fed will reduce interest rates over the next year than whether the central bank will cut once again in November. As of Tuesday morning, markets were still pricing in a roughly 88% chance that the Fed cuts rates at its November meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But by the end of next year, markets see the Fed likely making one less cut than was priced in on Oct. 4 and two less cuts than markets were projecting on Sept. 18, the day the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point. General Motors (GM) stock rose more than 7% on Tuesday morning as the automaker boosted its profitability guidance for a third time this year. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: For the quarter, GM reported revenue of $48.78 billion, easily topping estimates of $44.69 billion per Bloomberg consensus, and higher than the prior quarter's nearly $48 billion. GM's Q3 revenue was also 10.5% higher than a year ago. The company booked adjusted earnings per share of $2.96, far outstripping expectations of $2.44. It reported EBIT-adjusted profit of $4.115 billion, up 15.5% from a year ago, with EBIT-adjusted margin climbing to 8.4% from 8.1% year over year. Read more here. US stocks retreated on Tuesday as investors digested a recent bond market sell-off and braced for the next wave of earnings reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped more than 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped more than 120 points, or 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid roughly 0.6%. A host of companies reported third quarter earnings Tuesday morning. The biggest premarket stock movers were GE Aerospace (GE), Verizon (VZ), 3M (MMM), and Philip Morris (PM). GE Aerospace stock fell over 5% and Verizon shares fell around 3% on mixed third quarter reports. Paint company Sherwin Williams (SHW) fell 4% after an earnings miss. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Moody’s (MCO) fell less than 1% despite strong results. Meanwhile, Philip Morris jumped 3% after raising its guidance thanks to higher cigarette prices as well as its surging smoke-free business. General Motors (GM) rose 1.4% and tech and manufacturing conglomerate 3M jumped 6% after earnings beats.

Novatek has been pressing ahead with its new Arctic LNG 2 project despite Western sanctions restricting access to the tankers it needs to carry LNG along the Northern Sea Route to Asian markets. Loadings of Russian LNG will be prohibited in EU ports from March 2025. To address its shortage of vessels able to navigate Arctic waters, Russia plans to have those it does have unload their cargoes to regular vessels at sea, freeing them up for new shipments, the draft seen by Reuters showed. Novatek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the draft, the first area for ship-to-ship transfers will be set up near the Chosha Bay in the Barents Sea for Obsky Ammiak, a subsidiary of Novatek. Russia then plans to set up a second facility with the samecapacity in Kresta Bay in the Bering Sea, the draft showed. Transfers - which will only happen when ship movement is not hindered by ice - will allow for the loadings of 4.1 million cubic metres of LNG and 1.4 mcm of gas condensate a year in each facility, the document showed. Novatek already uses the same scheme to perform ship-to-ship LNG transfers off the coast of Russia's Murmansk region. (Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Jan Harvey) "

The U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), a federal government body that studies risks in AI systems, was created in November 2023 as a part of President Joe Biden's AI Executive Order. The AISI operates within NIST, an agency of the Commerce Department that develops guidance for the deployment of various categories of technologies. But while the AISI has a budget, a director, and a research partnership with its counterpart in the U.K., the U.K. AI Safety Institute, it could be wound down with a simple repeal of Biden's executive order. \"If another president were to come into office and repeal the AI Executive Order, they would dismantle the AISI,\" Chris MacKenzie, senior director of communications at Americans for Responsible Innovation, an AI lobby group, told TechCrunch. \"And [Donald] Trump has promised to repeal the AI Executive Order. So Congress formally authorizing the AI Safety Institute would ensure its continued existence regardless of who's in the White House.\" Beyond assuring the AISI's future, authorizing the office could also lead to more stable, long-term funding for its initiative from Congress. The AISI currently has a budget of around $10 million — a relatively small amount considering the concentration of major AI labs in Silicon Valley. \"Appropriators in Congress tend to give higher budgeting priority to entities formally authorized by Congress,\" MacKenzie said, \"with the understanding that those entities have broad buy-in and are here for the long run, rather than just a single administration's one-off priority.\" In a letter today, a coalition of over 60 companies, nonprofits, and universities called on Congress to enact legislation codifying the AISI before the end of the year. Among the undersigners are OpenAI and Anthropic, both of which have signed agreements with the AISI to collaborate on AI research, testing, and evaluation. The Senate and House have each advanced bipartisan bills to authorize the activities of the AISI. But the proposals have faced some opposition from conservative lawmakers including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who's called for the Senate version of the AISI bill to pull back on diversity programs. Granted, the AISI is a relatively weak organization from an enforcement perspective. Its standards are voluntary. But think tanks and industry coalitions — as well as tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and IBM, all of which signed the aforementioned letter — see the AISI as the most promising avenue to AI benchmarks that can form the basis of future policy.

Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance The company reported a net gain of 239,000 monthly phone subscribers, beating analysts’ projections of 222,000. But total revenue was essentially flat from a year earlier at $33.3 billion, slightly under analysts’ expectations of $33.4 billion, as service revenue and other growth was offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue. It was the second consecutive quarter that lower equipment revenue overshadowed other gains. The stock slid 4.1% Tuesday late-morning in New York. “The downturn in equipment sales is tied to a lack of compelling new hardware features from the smartphone makers, leading to a marked reduction in switching and lower churn,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote in a recent note. Telecom executives, including Verizon Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg, have said they didn’t expect Apple Inc.’s latest iPhone, which came out in September, to spur a significant upgrade cycle. Apple’s iPhone 16 offers only modest hardware upgrades, and its advanced artificial intelligence technology will only be gradually added to the device via incremental software updates. Vestberg said it’s still unclear whether the promises of AI capabilities in new iPhone models will convince people to upgrade. Historically, consumers have been persuaded to trade in their devices by hardware redesigns or a significant network evolution such as 5G. “Is the software side going to do that?” Vestberg asked on a video presentation to analysts on Tuesday. “It’s too early for us to say. So far we haven’t seen that it is creating the cycle.” Customers used to upgrade every 12 months but now they are keeping their phones for more than 40 months, Vestberg had said previously. As the pool of potential new wireless customers tightens, New York-based Verizon has been offering customizable mobile and broadband plans and throwing in perks such as savings on streaming services like Netflix and Max. The company is also pushing its fixed wireless product, which delivers high-speed internet over the airwaves rather than through lines into the home. Vestberg said this “convergence” of plans and products has been attractive to customers and leads to lower churn, or customers leaving for rivals.                ",

The CEO of the largest U.S. bank has long been floated for senior positions on U.S. economic policy.

But I always reserve the right\" to reconsider, he said. Dimon took the reins at JPMorgan in 2006. He has emphasized that he and the rest of the board will \"do the right thing\" on succession when he eventually leaves, without specifying details. He has been outspoken on economic and policy matters and has often celebrated American exceptionalism, including in his widely read annual letter in April. \"I've always been an American patriot and my country is more important to me than my company,\" he told analysts on a call this month.

While some rival automakers are cutting prices and boosting incentives to reduce inventory, GM has been able to hold the line on high-demand vehicles like its gas-powered GMC Yukon SUV and Chevy Silverado pickup. Profits from those models more than offset losses from a growing electric vehicle business and continued red ink in China. “Our year-over-year performance has been very strong,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on a call with reporters. “We’ve been able to grow retail share with above average prices, below average incentives and well managed inventory. This has put us in a position to update guidance once again.” Industry-wide US new vehicle sales have fallen for the past two quarters, with the decline accelerating to 1.9% in the most recent three-month period. High sticker prices and financing costs are dissuading some would-be buyers. But GM has been able to maintain its margins with a combination of price discipline and well-managed inventories. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, GM said its net income came in flat at $3 billion, or $2.96 a share on an adjusted basis, up from $2.28 a year ago and also above the $2.45 per share average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the company rose 8.2% — the biggest jump in nine months — to $52.95 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York. The stock is up about 47% this year. GM hiked its adjusted automotive cash flow guidance for all of 2024 to a range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, a significant boost from a prior projected high of $11.5 billion. With that kind of cash expected to come in, it has stepped up stock buybacks, repurchasing almost 250 million shares over the past year. That’s a big reason for the per-share adjusted earnings beat and gains from a year ago, the company said. On a net basis, the carmaker actually trimmed the high end of its full-year outlook slightly by $300 million to $11.1 billion.                  ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the US will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Fouquet said in an interview during the Bloomberg Tech Summit in London on Tuesday. “The question is what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” Washington has for years sought to limit China’s rise in the semiconductor sector, through repeated rounds of export controls that have targeted the sale of advanced artificial intelligence chips and chipmaking equipment. The Dutch government has struggled to find a middle ground between its US ally and its top company’s biggest market. Fouquet said much of ASML’s business with China is focused on mature technology that is less relevant to national security concerns. “A lot of the focus in China today is on mainstream semiconductors,” he said. “This is very different from AI.” ASML has a monopoly on making the lithography machines that help the world’s largest semiconductor companies to produce the advanced chips that power everything from Apple Inc.’s smartphones to Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerators. China has never been able to buy ASML’s most advanced machines, which use extreme ultraviolet, or EUV technology. The Netherlands has also restricted ASML from selling some of its second most-advanced immersion DUV lithography systems to China and last month published new export control rules that made ASML apply for export licenses in The Hague. China relies on ASML’s systems to advance its chip-making technology, as the country has not yet been able to develop similar equipment capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductors. Fouquet said the existing restrictions mean China is “10 to 15 years behind when it comes to advanced technology.” China was ASML’s biggest market for the last five quarters, accounting for €2.79 billion ($3 billion) of sales in the most recent period, nearly half of ASML’s total. Fouquet said that Chinese demand had been elevated due to a backlog that dated to orders placed during the Covid-19 pandemic. ASML expects sales to the country will shrink to about 20% of total revenue next year, a level that it considers more normal.                     ",

Small business owners should stay alert too and recognize that the scammers can strike both online and in person. “We’ve seen an uptick in cyberattacks during disasters,” said Jennifer Butler, partner in disaster recovery at global advisory firm EisnerAmper. “Small businesses should really pay attention to that, really be aware of scams, of phishing attempts or potential cyberattacks on their systems. Because this is the time when, you know, those bad actors are going to come after small businesses.” Because small businesses might have a variety of employees and contractors coming and going after a disaster as they seek to mitigate damage and reopen, owners should be vigilant about verifying the identity of anyone they're working with. “Always ask for ID, documentation, those kinds of things,” Butler said. No one should be asking for payment up front, particularly anyone that says they're from a government organization such as the Small Business Administration. “Make sure you’re not paying anybody to help you if they’re saying that they’re from the federal government,” she added. Florida officials have said there are reports of scammers in the area who are posing as Federal Emergency Management Agency officials and trying to get financial information from the storm’s victims.

While officials aren’t offering many pointers on how rapidly or by how much borrowing costs will fall from here, investors are betting on quarter-point moves at the next four meetings and a deposit rate of 2% by mid-2025. Fueling such wagers are indications that inflation could sustainably reach the 2% target sooner than thought. France’s Francois Villeroy de Galhau has suggested that the goal may actually be achieved as early as the start of next year. Speaking separately, Governing Council member Robert Holzmann said a faster-than-expected retreat in prices will allow the ECB to lower rates again before too long. His Portuguese counterpart Mario Centeno said officials would be ready consider ramping up monetary easing should data suggest such a move. Money markets added to loosening bets, with traders betting on 32 basis points of cuts in December and 58 basis points by January, compared with 30 basis points and 56 basis points before. That implies a 28% chance of a half-point move in December. Inflation eased below 2% in September for the first time since 2021 due to tumbling energy costs. There are lingering worries, though, as wage growth and services prices remain elevated. A temporary uptick in inflation is expected in the coming months and Lagarde, despite her optimism, still had some words of caution.               "

ATLANTA — Norfolk Southern delivered significant gains in earnings and operating ratio during 2024’s third quarter, with new CEO Mark George noting the railroad is “continuing to close the margin gap” with its peers. The railroad announced adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.1 billion on revenues of $3.05 billion, with an adjusted OR of 63.4%. The adjusted earnings are a 23% increase over the same quarter in 2023, while the OR is an improvement of 570 basis points, as well as a gain of 650 bps since the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jason Zampi said during an earnings call with analysts Tuesday. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.24 was up 23% from 2023’s third quarter. Revenue was up 3%. The railroad’s positive results came despite challenges arising from Hurricane Helene, which the company said had the greatest impact on its rail network since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. George said the “fast and effective actions” of NS railroaders “resulted in us being able to recover and serve our communities within days.” While the railroad’s line into Asheville, North Carolina, is likely to remain closed for months, its key routes were reopened within 72 hours. Recovery efforts included clearing more than 15,000 downed trees, dealing with more than 1,000 locations where commercial power was out and replacing some 150 tons of ballast. About 35 miles of track sustained damage, along with five bridges and 54 slide fences. Chief Operating Officer John Orr highlighted efficiency and cost control moves including a reduction of 130 crew starts per day and a 20% reduction in overtime. The improved productivity has allowed the railroad to store 500 locomotives so far this year — an increase of 200 from the second quarter — as well as reduce the number of cars online by 1,000 during the quarter and 8,000 in the year to date. George said the resulting fluidity was reflected in the ability to recover from Helene. “I would tell you a year ago some of the events we saw in the quarter would have set us back three months,” he said. “But we were back within a week. And now we’re actually at record network speeds and low dwell.” Dwell is at 22.5 hours, down from 23.2 in the third quarter a year ago and a high of 24.6 hours in the fourth quarter of 2023. Train speed is at 22.3 mph systemwide and 20 mph for merchandise, compared to 20.5 mph for the system and 18.1 for merchandise in 2023’s third quarter. Car-miles per day has risen to 114 from 101 in the same quarter a year ago. The railroad’s overall volume was up 7%, with a 2% gain in merchandise (563,900 carloads) and 3% gain in merchandise revenue ($1.86 billion). Intermodal volume (1,052,200 units) was up 9%, with revenue ($763 million) up 4%. Coal volume was up 11% at 185,300, but revenue was down 2% at $427 million.      "

Since its listing, Trump Media has been popular with traders who view it as a speculative bet on Trump winning the Nov. 5 election. He owns 57% of the company, making his stake now worth almost $4 billion. Trump Media's revenue in the June quarter was $837,000 and the company is burning cash. Strategists say its nearly $7 billion stock market value is detached from its day-to-day business. As of mid-day, traders had exchanged $1.1 billion worth of Trump Media shares, in line with a recent surge in trading volume, according to LSEG data. Trump's odds of beating Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, in election have recently edged higher on betting websites, though opinion polls show the race is a dead heat. Oddschecker.com, which reflects odds across a number of betting platforms, had Trump at the equivalent of about a 62% chance of winning and Harris at about 38%. On the PredictIt platform, contracts for a Trump victory traded at 60 cents, with a potential $1 payout. Harris contracts were at 46 cents. Polymarket has Trump with a 64% chance of winning and Harris at 36%, with a combined $2.2 billion in volume. One of four accounts on Polymarket that have fueled speculation over their large bets on a Trump victory added to its wagers Tuesday, increasing the potential payout if Trump wins to nearly $44 million, according to Polymarket's activity tracker. With just two weeks left before the election, Harris held a marginal 46% to 43% lead over Trump in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Other polls show the two candidates neck and neck in the seven battleground states that are expected to determine the winner. Trump Media saw its value briefly balloon to nearly $10 billion following its March stock market debut through a tie-up with a blank-check company.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) — Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic is releasing a new tool that can understand what’s happening on a user’s computer screen and complete a range of online tasks for them — the latest example of tech companies expanding from chatbots that offer pithy responses to so-called AI agents that can act on a person’s behalf.The new capability, called “computer use,” can interpret what a user is seeing on their computer and — with permission — take actions for them by browsing the web, clicking buttons and typing, Anthropic said Tuesday. The company is releasing a beta version to developers using its Claude technology, after testing the service with a limited set of enterprise customers in recent weeks. A growing number of AI companies are investing in building agents that field tasks for users with minimal human supervision, an attempt to fulfill the promise of artificial intelligence to radically increase productivity in our personal and professional lives. On Monday, Microsoft Corp. launched a set of agent tools designed to send emails and manage records for workers. Salesforce Inc. touted its enterprise agent apps for customer service at its Dreamforce event last month.Anthropic is taking a different approach than many other companies have with agent tools. Rather than integrate with various applications on the backend, its technology can process what’s happening on a user’s computer screen in real time. The company said this method creates a more intuitive experience.“It’s going to be the first model ever to be able to use a computer the way that people do,” Jared Kaplan, co-founder and chief science officer at Anthropic, said in an interview with Bloomberg News. In a pre-recorded demo, an Anthropic employee used the tool to figure out the logistics of taking a friend for a morning hike with views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Anthropic’s AI agent was able to search on Google to find hikes, map a route, check the sunrise time and send a calendar invite with details including what kind of clothing to wear — all with no human input beyond an initial prompt. Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-conscious AI company, but the new tool might invite added scrutiny. Technology that can access a user’s screen activity comes with heightened safety and security concerns. When Microsoft, for example, unveiled its AI-enabled “Recall” feature that created a record of everything users do on their computers, a backlash ensued over worries that the software could be vulnerable to hacking. It ended up relaunching the product with security upgrades.        "

        "body": "(Reuters) - Walmart (WMT) said on Tuesday it will now deliver prescription medicines and medication refills as a single order along with groceries and other items as soon as 30 minutes, as part of its new express delivery option. The retail bellwether's latest move comes a couple of weeks after technology giant Amazon.com (AMZN) announced its plans to open pharmacies with same-day delivery options across 20 new U.S. cities in 2025. Walmart's previous efforts to dispatch prescription medications typically took at least five to seven business days, while an overnight delivery upon request was charged an additional $15. The company, which has nearly 4,600 store locations with pharmacies, said the new delivery option is available in six states, namely Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin. It would be delivering in 49 states by the end of January next year. Walmart Plus members will receive free delivery, while non-members will have to pay a standard charge of $9.95. The retailer added customers have the option to choose on-demand or express delivery, where the items would be available as soon as 30 minutes, or same-day delivery, where the order can be scheduled for a specific time. \"Customers will be able to seamlessly add prescriptions along with other items from their local Walmart in a single order, available both in-app and online,\" the company said. It will offer all medications except controlled substances, those that need refrigeration and Medicare Part B items that cover services such as outpatient care. Healthcare firm CVS Health offers free same-day delivery to customers with its membership program, CarePass. Pharmacy chain Walgreens offers 24-hour delivery along with groceries and over-the-counter medications, among other items. Earlier this year, Walmart said it would close all 51 of its health clinics and its virtual healthcare operations, as it did not see the business model as sustainable to continue.
