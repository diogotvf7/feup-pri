The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 344.31 points, or 0.80%, to finish the session at 42,931.60, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.18% to close 5,853.98, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.27% to end the day at 18,540.01. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist, LPL Financial, said that last week, the S&P 500 rose 0.9% and closed at a record high. \u201cThis was the broader market\u2019s sixth straight weekly gain, marking its longest winning streak of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the market is entering a potentially volatile period ahead of the election and facing overhead resistance near the upper end of its rising price channel, history suggests investors should buy dips as momentum tends to continue after a six-week winning streak,\" Turnquist said. Updated at 12:25 PM EDT Tesla shares extended their recent drawdown in mid-day Monday trading ahead of the carmaker's third quarter earnings later in the week. Tesla, which is down 12.6% over the past month and 8.5% since its disappointing robotaxi event in Los Angeles on October 10, is expected to post a bottom line of 48 cents per share on revenues of $25.37 billion. Tesla shares were last marked 0.97% lower, against a 0.17% pullback for the Nasdaq, and changing hands at $218.68 each. Updated at 11:20 AM EDT The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currencies, hit a fresh two-month high of 103.824 as Treasury yields continue to climb amid reflation risks tied to the world's biggest economy. Gold prices, as well, are holding recent gains, after hitting an all-time peak of $2,733 per ounce in overnight trading. Updated at 9:34 AM EDT The S&P 500 was marked 7 points, or 0.13% lower in the opening minutes of trading, with the Nasdaq down 47 points, or 0.26%. The Dow, meanwhile, slipped 58 points while the mid-cap Russell 2000 fell 1 point, or 0.04%. Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields were last marked at 4.138%, up 2 basis points from overnight levels, while 2-year notes were pegged at 3.989%.

Stocks ended mixed on Monday, with a modest decline for the S&P 500, a larger pullback for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a gain for the tech-focused Nasdaq as bond markets returned to their recent volatility. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, rose 11 basis points on the session, while adding another in overnight trading, and were last marked at a three month high of 4.208% heading into the New York session. Merrill Lynch's MOVE index, which tracks fixed income volatility and is known as the 'VIX for bonds', is trading at the highest levels of the year and is up nearly 48.6% from its early July lows. Messaging from Federal Reserve officials that suggested a slower pace of rate cuts, election uncertainty and the prospect of higher deficits regardless of who wins the White House and renewed inflation concerns tied to the outperforming economy have all combined to drive yields higher. The moves are sapping risk sentiment in markets around the world, and driving the dollar index to multi-month highs against a basket of its global peers. That's being played out in this mornings premarket session, where futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 suggest a 28 point pullback, with the Dow called 200 points lower and the Nasdaq poised of a 130 point decline. Related: S&P 500 blows past bond market warnings A heavy slate of earnings is expected throughout the session, with 3M  (MMM) , GE Aerospace  (GE) , Lockheed Martin  (LMT)  and Verizon  (VZ)  reporting before the opening bell and Texas Instruments  (TXN)  updating after the close.

        "body": "The stock market could face a 7% correction by mid-November, says Fundstrat's Mark Newton. Investor complacency and weak seasonals could trigger decline, according to Newton. He views any potential pullback as a \"buy the dip\" opportunity. The stock market looks poised for a 7% correction by mid-November, according to technical analyst Mark Newton of Fundstrat. Newton told clients in a note on Thursday that he is expecting the S&P 500 to see weakness heading into November as investor sentiment hits complacent levels just ahead of the general election on November 5. \"While intermediate-term bullish these remains very much intact, it's doubtful that US Equities continue to push up into and post-election without any consolidation,\" Newton said. Newton said the potential correction he expects in the stock market is likely to be a \"short-term correction only\" and \"not the start of a larger decline,\" playing into Fundstrat's Tom Lee's consistent message that investors should view any decline in the stock market as a \"buy the dip\" opportunity. Newton is monitoring the 5,900 level on the S&P 500 as potential resistance for the index. The S&P 500 traded at around 5,850 on Friday. \"The issues with near-term complacency (as judged by low Equity put/call levels), waning breadth, poor seasonal trends and cyclical projections for November as well as SPX's largest sector, Technology, not performing well of late, are all reasons to be alert for possible trend change in the weeks to come,\" Newton explained. One \"key reason\" Newton is turning bearish in the short-term is that the current rally in stocks that started in early August is 88 days long, which is exactly how long the April 19 to July 16 rally lasted before a sell-off materialized. From a time perspective, that's \"why this rally might 'run out of steam,\" Newton said. Other areas of technical weakness that Newton is monitoring includes negative divergences in momentum as measured by the RSI and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators, a lack of bearish investors as measured by the AAII investor sentiment data, and seasonal cycles that show a peak in the stock market in mid-to-late October followed by a sell-off through November. \"This market has seemingly 'dodged a bullet' thus far during one of the historically worst periods during most election years. However, investors should not take this to mean that the coast is clear for an interrupted rally higher all year,\" Newton said. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

        "body": "Indexes slipped Thursday as investors priced in a higher-than-expected inflation reading. The data raises the possibility of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy. Traders still see the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points at next month's meeting. Stocks fell on Thursday from records reached in the previous session, as traders took in a sticky inflation reading for September. All three benchmark indexes fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down TK points, a 0.40% fall, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.% and 0.%, respectively. The declines follow rises across the board on Wednesday, which saw a fresh record close for both the S&P 500 and the Dow, and comes after inflation proved stickier than expected last month. September consumer price index data released on Thursday showed inflation rose 2.4% year-over-year, slightly above consensus forecasts of a 2.3% rise. The core CPI reading, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, was up 3.3% year-over-year and just above forecasts of 3.2%. The reading, coupled with last week's blockbuster jobs report, has sparked talk of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy, a scenario in which strong economic growth fuels inflation and makes it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut rates. A no landing would likely mean rate cuts are fewer or slower than markets had previously forecast. It would also mean borrowers are saddled with higher interest rates on their debt for longer. After the CPI release, investors adjusted their expectations for the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. The September jobs report had killed the odds of another big 50 basis point cut, but the slightly higher-than-expected CPI likely isn't enough to fully pump the brakes on Fed easing. \"Heading into the report, we thought only a very firm print would lead the Fed to consider pausing in November based on inflation alone. We did not get that,\" analysts from Bank of America said Thursday. \"While core PCE will be firmer than recent months, we think it will be enough for the Fed to follow through with a 25bp cut in November,\" they added. Investors are now pricing in higher odds of a 25 basis point rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims edged up 33,000 to 258,000, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That number marks its highest level in over a year and outpaced forecasts of 230,000.

But the rise in stocks puts major indexes at lofty valuations, leaving long-term investors wondering how they should proceed from here. Bankrate\u2019s Third-Quarter Market Mavens Survey asked market professionals what, if anything, long-term investors should do with their portfolios as stocks trade near all-time highs. Here\u2019s what they had to say. This article is one in a series discussing the results of Bankrate\u2019s Third-Quarter 2024 Market Mavens Survey: Survey: Market strategists see 10-year Treasury yield at 3.5% a year from now Best moves for long-term investors with stocks near all-time highs, according to market experts Stock market outlook for the next 12 months: Here\u2019s what top analysts are predicting into 2025 With stocks near all-time highs, there\u2019s a good chance that there have been some shifts in investors\u2019 portfolio allocations over the past few years. The investment pros surveyed by Bankrate think now is a good time to review those allocations. \u201cIf investors only do one thing, they should rebalance portfolios back to their targeted allocations,\u201d says Chris Fasciano, senior portfolio manager at Commonwealth Financial Network. Wells Fargo Investment Institute Senior Global Market Strategist Sameer Samana also says now is a good time to review your overall portfolio. \u201cUpdate your financial plan, and rebalance in-line with the plan\u2019s recommended allocations,\u201d he says. Portfolio rebalancing and diversification go hand in hand. A key reason for portfolio rebalancing is to make sure your portfolio stays diversified and doesn\u2019t have too much or too little exposure to any one asset class. \u201cFor long-term investors, holding well-diversified portfolios, or broad market indices, is generally a winning strategy,\u201d says Dec Mullarkey, managing director at SLC Management. \u201cWhile markets can seem over valued at different points, some companies will deliver the expected strong growth while others fail but leave market share for new competitors,\u201d Mullarkey says. \u201cSo, sticking with well-diversified portfolios and periodically rebalancing to your long-term asset mix targets, tends to be a reliable formula to capture stable long-term performance.\u201d With stocks at highs, some of the experts surveyed expressed a more cautious tone and suggested investors pay close attention to any holdings that may be particularly risky.

The weight-loss company, previously championed by the likes of Oprah Winfrey, saw its stock spike this week after announcing that it will make copycats of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs. WW International (i.e. WeightWatchers) stock jumped nearly 40% Wednesday following the news, and the stock climbed an additional 23% Thursday to close at $1.96. WW is up 172% from last week. Though WeightWatchers\u2019 core business is its dieting program, the company has attempted to get in on the booming weight-loss drug market dominated by pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). (The strategy was championed by its former CEO Sima Sistani, who recently departed the company.) WeightWatchers first attempted to secure a foothold in the weighty drug space early last year with its acquisition of Sequence, a telehealth platform specializing in weight-loss medication management. The acquisition has failed to improve the company\u2019s revenue, which fell 14.5% in 2023 and is expected to decline another 13% this year. WeightWatchers\u2019 announcement Tuesday that it will offer compounded GLP-1 drugs \u2014 which are cheaper and don't require insurance \u2014 is another shot at capitalizing on the market late in the game. Federal laws allow companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s shortage list. Regulations allow the drugs to be made at FDA-registered facilities, but the compounded medications themselves are not FDA-approved. WeightWatchers will offer a compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Here's the rub: Once the Novo Nordisk drugs are removed from the FDA\u2019s shortage list, WeightWatchers will no longer be able to produce compounded semaglutide drugs at scale. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound, was removed from the list last week, posing a massive problem for companies making compounded versions of the drug. \u201cCompounding is not a sustainable long-term business model,\u201d Barclays (BARC.L) healthcare technology and distribution analyst Stephanie Davis told Yahoo Finance. Davis is one of four Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg. Half of those analysts have Equal Weight ratings on WW, and Davis is one of the other two analysts who recommend selling the stock. Meanwhile, WeightWatchers\u2019 expansion in the weight-loss drug space contradicts its core business. \u201cGLP-1s are going to cannibalize the diet industry,\u201d Davis said.            ",

Think again, say Bank of America Corp. strategists.

A Republican sweep is typically seen as most positive for small caps, but Donald Trump\u2019s promised immigration clampdown could also constitute a risk for smaller business that rely on immigrant labor. Renewable energies or electric vehicles could also be under pressure if Republicans hold both the executive and legislative branches, they said. On the other hand, a possible TikTok ban under a Democratic administration could be positive for US online media companies, they added. The race between both candidates is tightening and campaign officials and political operatives are anticipating a jump-ball election, decided at the margins in seven battleground states. BofA strategist Michael Hartnett said in a separate note last week that investors have started ramping up assets which had thrived in the wake of Trump\u2019s 2016 victory.
