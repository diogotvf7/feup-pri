        "body": "China’s policymakers disappointed investors this week with a lack of follow-through on recent monetary policy stimulus measures. They get a second chance this weekend. China’s Ministry of Finance is set to hold a briefing on Saturday local time that’s expected to deliver up to 2 trillion yuan, or about $282 billion, in fiscal stimulus to an economy that continues to stagger under real-estate woes. My mother-in-law stole $25,000 from my husband’s emergency fund. We donated to charity rather than give her a birthday gift — and she cried foul. ‘It’s so unfair!’ I’m miserable in my job. I’m 58 and have $1 million in a 401(k) and Roth IRA. Can I afford to quit? ‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust? ‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off? ‘Their house was purchased with my family money’: My late father left a life estate to his second wife. She’s only 10 years older than me. How can I undo this? “Our economists highlight that the current market expectation is for a CNY1.5-2 trillion package (excluding CNY1 trillion in recapitalisation for big banks) and it will be important whether the actual announcement meets this threshold after a week of nervousness following a week or so of euphoria,” Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a Friday note. Euphoria indeed. Chinese stocks ripped higher at the end of September after the announcement of rate cuts and other measures by the People’s Bank of China aimed at breaking the economy out of its funk. But the rally stalled this week as investors returned from a holiday week looking for more support on the fiscal front. A briefing from the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s state economic planning body, on Tuesday failed to outline more stimulus measures, sending stocks into a skid. The China CSI 300 XX:000300 fell more than 3% this week, while the Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP dropped 3.6% the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI in Hong Kong dropped more than 6%. China-related ETFs saw sharp falls and were among the week’s biggest decliners. The Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF ASHR was off nearly 14% for the week, while the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB dropped nearly 10%. Deutsche Bank estimated that the total size of both fiscal and monetary stimulus could potentially reach CNY7.5 trillion, or 6% of GDP in 2024. That would make it the largest package in yuan terms and the third largest relative to GDP, Reid said. On the fiscal side, a CNY2 trillion yuan package would be comparable in size to what the government did in its 2020 pandemic response combined with other measures (see chart below).           ",

        "body": "Former President Donald Trump is again turning heads with his push to slash the federal corporate tax rate. The 2024 GOP presidential nominee proposes lowering it from 21% to 15%, which has stirred up much debate. Some see it as the key to supercharging the U.S. economy and stock market. Others, however, aren't so sure. Don't Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. Supporters of Trump’s plan point to past economic gains when taxes were lowered. According to the Tax Foundation, dropping the corporate tax rate to 15% could boost the U.S. GDP by 0.4% and add roughly 93,000 full-time jobs. This is music to the ears of those who believe that lower taxes will make the U.S. more attractive for business. A more competitive environment, they argue, could drive corporate growth, pump up earnings and ultimately benefit shareholders as stock prices climb. Trending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share Advocates also think this cut could push companies to funnel more money into share buybacks, further inflating stock prices. But the critics have their doubts. One big concern is the potential impact on federal revenues. As cited by CNN, Trump’s proposal could increase the national debt by between $1.5 trillion and $15.2 trillion. Even when factoring in economic growth, the revenue loss would still be a whopping $460 billion. As the U.S. grapples with a rising federal deficit – already expected to hit 202.6% of GDP by 2065 – some worry that these tax cuts might tie the government's hands when funding essential programs. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Another question in the air is whether corporate tax cuts reliably lead to stock market booms? Trump significantly boosted Corporate America by lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This legislation, along with a strong economy, led to record-breaking corporate earnings. Many executives decided to reward shareholders rather than investing in growth or hiring.             ",

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. kick off the the quarterly earnings-report cycle on Friday, followed by Citigroup Inc., Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Bank of America Corp. next week. Banks provide a good read on the state of both consumers and other companies, making their quarterly reports a crucial part of the earnings season. US bank stocks jumped almost 10% in the third quarter amid optimism around policymakers’ rate-cutting cycle and the resilient state of the economy, turning the latest update into a test of whether expectations ran too far. So far the going has been good for banks. Second quarter earnings were the second best among S&P 500 sub-industries with banks notably trouncing the S&P 500 Index as a whole, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. The focus is now on how net interest income, loan and deposit growth, credit quality, and consumer spending resilience will fare as US interest rates come down from a more than two-decade high. Bank stocks have been on a roll this year, with the KBW Bank Index rising almost 21%, roughly in line with the S&P 500 — no small feat considering the broader benchmark has seen its gains largely powered by tech giants like Nvidia and Apple. Still, the rally for banks has pushed them back around the peaks seen in late July. Analysts are split pretty evenly between buy and hold ratings. The split sets the tone for the earnings ahead; half expect the going to get better, while the other half have signaled caution. “Investors still seem optimistic about 2025 prospects, but with lingering near-term anxiety on net interest income,” said Piper Sandler’s analyst R. Scott Siefers. “In order words,” he wrote in a note, “while investors are optimistic about next year’s prospects, the path to get there could still be bumpy.” In September, JPMorgan President and Chief Operating Officer Daniel Pinto sent shares tumbling after warning investors that analysts are being too optimistic in projecting next year’s expenses and net interest income as rates start coming down. Pinto said that the net interest income estimate of $89.5 billion was “not very reasonable” given interest-rate expectations, and the figure “will be lower.”                ",

        "body": "By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) - BlackRock's assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows, while the world's largest asset manager continued a push to expand its footprint in private markets. Assets managed by BlackRock shot to $11.48 trillion in the period, compared with $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter, the company said on Friday. That growth came as stocks reversed an August sell-off and broadened their rally in the third quarter, boosted by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. BlackRock is expanding its offerings to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. \"Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working,\" Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. The company's shares were recently up 3.6% on Friday. They have advanced about 18% in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21% jump in the S&P 500. Last week, the New York-based firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding over $100 billion in assets to its kitty. Later this year, it is expected to close its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin. The two deals are expected to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and in private markets, both key areas of growth. \"Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets in powering economic growth,\" Fink said in an earnings call on Friday. BlackRock registered $160 billion in long-term net inflows in the third quarter. Total net inflows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as interest rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. But with interest rates expected to fall as the Federal Reserve continues a long-anticipated easing cycle it kicked off in September, some of that money could flow into assets such as fixed income products, a development Fink said could occur in a more “normalized” but \"relatively high-rate environment.” Equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2%. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier.    ",

        "body": "Indexes slipped Thursday as investors priced in a higher-than-expected inflation reading. The data raises the possibility of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy. Traders still see the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points at next month's meeting. Stocks fell on Thursday from records reached in the previous session, as traders took in a sticky inflation reading for September. All three benchmark indexes fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down TK points, a 0.40% fall, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.% and 0.%, respectively. The declines follow rises across the board on Wednesday, which saw a fresh record close for both the S&P 500 and the Dow, and comes after inflation proved stickier than expected last month. September consumer price index data released on Thursday showed inflation rose 2.4% year-over-year, slightly above consensus forecasts of a 2.3% rise. The core CPI reading, which excludes more volatile food and energy costs, was up 3.3% year-over-year and just above forecasts of 3.2%. The reading, coupled with last week's blockbuster jobs report, has sparked talk of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy, a scenario in which strong economic growth fuels inflation and makes it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut rates. A no landing would likely mean rate cuts are fewer or slower than markets had previously forecast. It would also mean borrowers are saddled with higher interest rates on their debt for longer. After the CPI release, investors adjusted their expectations for the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. The September jobs report had killed the odds of another big 50 basis point cut, but the slightly higher-than-expected CPI likely isn't enough to fully pump the brakes on Fed easing. \"Heading into the report, we thought only a very firm print would lead the Fed to consider pausing in November based on inflation alone. We did not get that,\" analysts from Bank of America said Thursday. \"While core PCE will be firmer than recent months, we think it will be enough for the Fed to follow through with a 25bp cut in November,\" they added. Investors are now pricing in higher odds of a 25 basis point rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims edged up 33,000 to 258,000, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That number marks its highest level in over a year and outpaced forecasts of 230,000. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the closing bell on Thursday: S&P 500: 5,780.05, down 0.21% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 42,454.12, down 0.14% (-57.88 points) Nasdaq composite: 18,282.05, down 0.05%           ",

        "body": "Donald Trump’s campaign team is examining steps to sideline Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, should the former president return to the White House. Speaking with Barron’s, Trump economic advisor Scott Bessent suggested Congress approve a Fed chair designate more than a year before the central bank governor’s term expires in May 2026. This would effectively install a babysitter alongside the current Fed chair, and it could render Powell a lame duck for the remainder of his time in office. Bessent, founder of the hedge fund Key Square Group, is reportedly on the short list for Treasury secretary in a second Trump administration, according to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal. “You could do the earliest Fed nomination and create a shadow Fed chair,” Bessent told Barron’s. “And based on the concept of forward guidance, no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore.” During Trump’s latter half in office, his relationship with the Fed chair, whom the president himself had appointed, became increasingly acrimonious. Powell repeatedly ignored White House pressure to help the president’s reelection chances by juicing the economy through lower interest rates. Taking to Twitter to launch a tirade against Powell became a regular occurrence. Once Trump even asked whether the Fed chair was a bigger enemy to the American people than China’s Xi Jinping. Bessent said he has circulated the plan to sideline Powell among fellow Trump campaign advisors, where it was well received. Nonetheless, this is not official policy, at least not yet. “This is my idea,” the hedge fund manager added, “not the president’s.” Citing his purported business acumen, Trump has openly expressed a desire to erode the U.S. central bank’s prized independence. This has sparked comparisons to Richard Nixon, whose Fed chair was widely considered the worst in the institution’s recent history. Ed Yardeni, a Wall Street veteran and president of Yardeni Research, told the publication it was a “terrible” idea. A shadow Fed chair would “create a lot of noise in the market,” leaving investors guessing as to whose words weighed more heavily within the FOMC, the Fed’s main policy-setting committee. “Everybody would be looking at the calendar to see when Powell is out,” Yardeni told Barron’s. The independence of the Fed from the political vagaries on Pennsylvania Avenue and Capitol Hill is considered sacrosanct—a crucial prerequisite for a responsible monetary policy that places price stability at its core.

The ministry didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. While major Western merchants stopped originating grain for export in Russia after facing government pressure in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, the traders can still buy cargoes of Russian grain from other firms. Those transactions still typically occur at large volumes. The Russian grain industry has grown increasingly consolidated after Western merchants pulled back and as the country’s top private trader faced a spat with the state. That put the market in the hands of fewer companies, some of which have or had links to the Kremlin. Top Supplier Russia is the world’s biggest wheat exporter and any disruptions to its export flows would boost costs of the staple grain for buyers from Africa to Asia. Wheat also remains a major source of export revenue and political influence for the nation in the midst of its invasion of Ukraine, as food isn’t directly sanctioned. The union said that exporters had agreed not to provide Russian grain to foreign winners of tenders, during a meeting on the sidelines of the Golden Autumn exhibition in Moscow this week. It also criticized new exporters for “dumping” of grain and said that such practices must be eradicated. While wheat supplies in the country remain large, farmers reaped a smaller harvest this year amid frost and dry weather, breaking a streak of bumper production. Russia normally limits exports in the latter part of the season from February to June, with allowances allocated based on the volume traders exported in the first half. Quotas have not been restrictive in recent seasons. Still, Moscow’s exports at the start of the season have matched last year’s record volumes, which was expected to restrain shipments later on.        ",

        "body": "Russia’s vehicle market is growing this year, according to the Moscow-based AEB Automobile Manufacturers' Committee (a trade body that formerly represented many European brands in Russia). The AEB said the Russian automobile market grew by 58% in January-September 2024 and by 33% in September 2024. The AEB said total sales of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in September 2024 amounted to 151,491 units. It also said sales for the first nine months of 2024 exceeded sales for the same period in 2023 by 57.6% and amounted to more than 1.2 million vehicles. Chairman of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee, Alexey Kalitsev said in a statement: “As the committee expected, sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles kept on growing in September. As forecasted, this is largely due to the expectation of price increases amid changes in disposal fee rates and an increase in the key [interest] rate. “A record August was followed by a very successful September, which results significantly exceeded last year's figures. “However, despite the success, overall sales in the third quarter did not go beyond the sales volume in the second quarter of this year. This may indicate that we are approaching a limitation of the market's growth potential due to a decrease in purchasing power and the satisfaction of deferred demand from consumers. Most likely, the positive dynamics will continue in the coming months, butwill not be as rapid. “The results of 9 months demonstrate that, with a high degree of probability, by the end of 2024 the market will achieve higher figures than the committee forecasted earlier. “To ensure further market development, government support for demand and local production will be required.\" As European countries exited Russia following Russia’s military operations in Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent imposition of economic sanctions, Chinese OEMs have effectively replaced them in the Russian market and also started local assembly/manufacturing operations. Soaring trailer demand Gary Beecroft, an analyst with UK consultants CLEAR, also estimates that trailer demand has soared in Russia over the past two years. \"Russia's economy has shifted toward buying higher quantities of transport assets,\" he says. \"This has included heavy goods trailers. We estimate that overall trailer sales in Russia this year will be approaching 36,000, which compares with 24,000 in 2021, a more normal volume year for the industry. \"And again, the Chinese are filling the gaps left by Western manufacturers who previously exported to Russia - for both trucks and trailers.\"      ",

        "body": "AI enthusiasm has rebounded in recent weeks after investors worried about returns over the summer. In the next wave of investment, Goldman Sachs analysts recommend \"platform\" stocks like Microsoft and Datadog. Analysts recommend stocks that will build a direct application of AI and allow for more widespread adoption. Move over, Nvidia. With artificial intelligence investment rebounding after excitement cooled over the summer, a new set of stocks is set to benefit from the next wave of cash flowing to the burgeoning sector, according to Goldman Sachs. In the next round of AI investment, Goldman Sachs analysts say investors should look past the obvious picks—Nvidia and AI infrastructure companies—and toward a select set of platforms set to build out a direct application of AI. \"Our equity analysts believe 'platform' stocks, including databases and development tools, are set to be the primary beneficiaries of the next wave of generative AI investments. These platforms allow the best use of AI infrastructure while providing building blocks to construct next generation applications,\" the analysts said in a Thursday note. The analysts name Microsoft, DataDog, MongoDB, Elastic, and Snowflake as the best-positioned platform stocks as they roll out AI-integrated applications. While many of those platform stocks have plunged this year on near-term fundamental weakness, they have historically low valuations and stabilizing revisions that set them up well as AI investment rebounds, the analysts say. The analysts' recommendations come as investors remain focused on Nvidia and the companies that build out AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors, cloud providers, and data center REITs. The analysts say the share prices for those stocks will likely continue to increase, but returns will be driven more by earnings than valuations. \"Expected future returns could be constrained by elevated starting valuations, although valuations are historically a poor near-term signal for large-cap equities,\" the analysts said, adding that with AI spend surprising less to the upside than before, that could make for more moderate returns for those \"phase 2\" AI infrastructure stocks. In general, the platform stocks are the exception among other \"phase 3\" stocks—those with potential to monetize AI by generating incremental revenues like in software and IT services— because the timing of AI monetization is still uncertain. The same goes for \"phase 4\" stocks, or companies that would benefit from widespread adoption in general since that's likely still years away, the analysts said.     ",

        "body": "The fat and oils thrown away by Britain’s legion of fish-and-chip shops have long been viewed as useless waste. But now the nation’s chippies may want to reconsider: they could be sitting on supplies of liquid gold. For the first time, a major stock exchange is set to launch a market for supplies of waste cooking oils as production of eco-fuels becomes big business. Bursa Malaysia, Malaysia’s biggest stock market and the main hub for trading palm oil globally, is considering the launch of futures contracts for used cooking oil, according to Bloomberg. Cooking oil and similar waste are common by-products of restaurants and food manufacturers that use deep fat fryers. A typical tabletop fryer holds about 10 litres of oil and this needs to be changed at least once or twice a week, according to Bio UK Fuels, a Sheffield-based company that recycles the waste. This used oil can be used as a feedstock to produce so-called biofuels, which produce fewer carbon emissions compared to traditional petrol and diesel products. These are increasingly being used to fuel vehicles, provide heating and generate electricity, with the European Union adopting rules last year to mandate uptake. Waste oil biofuels consumption rose globally by almost 40pc between 2021 and 2023, according to an estimate from the Transport & Environment lobby group. Bursa Malaysia plans to offer US dollar-denominated contracts for lots of 25 metric tons of used cooking oil, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. A spokesperson for Bursa Malaysia said changes may still be made, with any contract launch subject to regulatory approval. Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- In less than a month, Americans will vote in one of the most consequential elections in US history. But on Wall Street things are eerily quiet, as the so-called smart money is reluctant to wager on what’s about to happen. Most Read from Bloomberg San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? “Never bet on the flip of a coin,” said George Ball, head of the Houston-based investment firm Sanders Morris Harris. “The election is too close to permit thoughtful investment positioning.” Hedge funds aren’t reducing their stock positions the way they historically do ahead of elections, and instead have elevated exposure to equities as the S&P 500 Index continues to set records, according to Goldman Sachs prime brokerage data going back to 2008. Meanwhile, options traders are more focused on the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cuts and the health of the US economy, putting the Nov. 5 vote lower on the list of immediate priorities, market veterans say. “Concerns about the elections are around fifth in line behind the war in the Middle East, the explosive moves in China, the push-and-pull of US economic data and shifting Fed easing expectations, upcoming earnings season, etcetera,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. The most recent election polling averages from Real Clear Politics show Democrat Kamala Harris with 49.2% support nationally, and Republican Donald Trump at 47.2%. But with the Electoral College, national averages are far less important than state-by-state polls, which essentially show a neck-and-neck race. And the chance of either party sweeping the presidency and both houses of Congress is considered low. Wait-And-See “First, it’s a very close presidential race, especially in the swing states,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. “Second, both candidates have very ambitious economic goals, and I highly doubt either will be able to fully implement these campaign promises unless their party takes the White House, the Senate, and the House.” Hedge funds are taking a wait-and-see approach to the election, waiting until there’s more clarity before making significant politically connected investment bets, said Jonathan Caplis, chief executive officer of hedge fund research firm PivotalPath. The approach has worked so far this year, as US long-short hedge funds have posted an 11% gain through September, which is in the top quartile of rolling nine-month returns since 2010, according to PivotalPath.

        "body": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock fell 1.7% Thursday after rallying as much as 9% the day before continuing its roller coaster ride of a week as investors swing between optimism over the company’s strong financials and cautiousness over its regulatory risks. Super Micro is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegations of shady business practices outlined in a scathing report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research in late August. That has pressured the stock, which has hovered under $50 per share since then. This week, SMCI climbed on positive reports from the AI server maker. Super Micro surged 16% Monday after the company released numbers showing strong demand for its products. The stock was up 12% on Thursday from the prior week. Super Micro makes servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) AI chips for data centers that power artificial intelligence software. The company said it’s shipping servers containing over 100,000 Nvidia GPUs per quarter “for some of the largest AI factories ever built.” Then on Tuesday, shares of SMCI fell 5% after a promising premarket rally that saw the stock jump as much as 7%. Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, said investors’ euphoria over the company’s shipment data faded against the backdrop of Super Micro’s regulatory risk. “I think one piece of good news hardly undoes multiple months of significant financial and regulatory scrutiny around a company like this,” Newman said. The Hindenburg report in August accused Super Micro of shoddy accounting, undisclosed relationships between its CEO and companies it does business with, and violations of US export bans. For example, Hindenburg said Super Micro has shipped servers to sanctioned Russian firms through shell companies, some of which were likely used by its military for its war against Ukraine. The day after Hindenburg released its report, Super Micro shares dropped 20%. The company also delayed filing its annual 10-K report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Super Micro’s woes continued with a Wall Street Journal report of an alleged DOJ probe, which sent shares tumbling in late September. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said the Hindenburg report contained “false or inaccurate statements” and “misleading presentations of information that we have previously shared publicly.” Liang said the company’s delayed 10-K filing would not affect the company’s fourth quarter financial results, adding that Super Micro would address Hindenburg’s allegations “in due course.” Super Micro’s stock climb this week displays the tension between its potential as a key player in the AI boom and its regulatory hurdles.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Celsius’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Celsius and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago when the stock gained 14% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results that blew past analysts' revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations. Notably, topline growth was strong as revenue grew 95% year on year, driven mostly by North American revenue (up 97% year on year). Management noted that the North American business was led by expansion in distribution points and higher SKUs per location. International revenue also came in strong. This was driven by new flavor launches, product availability, and increased velocity. As a result, the gross margin improved significantly (up 110% y/y) and contributed significantly to the EBITDA beat. On the other hand, its EPS narrowly missed analysts' expectations. Zooming out, this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track. Celsius is down 41.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $34.40 per share, it is trading 64.2% below its 52-week high of $96.11 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Celsius’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $32,048.

        "body": "Saturday marks the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. Since hitting its cycle bottom on Oct. 12, 2022, the S&P 500 SPX is up nearly 62%. The stock barometer has gained 21.2% already in 2024, registering 44 record closes along the way. Inevitably, those of a bearish bent have been getting more anxious as the S&P 500 ascends into the rarefied air near 6,000. At such peaks dizzy climbers are more prone to silly mistakes, they warn. My mother-in-law stole $25,000 from my husband’s emergency fund. We donated to charity rather than give her a birthday gift — and she cried foul. ‘It’s so unfair!’ I’m miserable in my job. I’m 58 and have $1 million in a 401(k) and Roth IRA. Can I afford to quit? ‘I feel like I’m missing something’: I’m 68, divorced with two children. I’ve $750,000 and rent my home. Do I need a trust? ‘This money is not bringing me a lot of happiness’: My husband and I have $7 million, but our kids are trouble. Should we cut them off? ‘Their house was purchased with my family money’: My late father left a life estate to his second wife. She’s only 10 years older than me. How can I undo this? Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, is having none of that. Carson turned bullish in Nov. 2022, dismissing those who warned that stocks would continue to struggle as recession loomed for the U.S. In fact, Detrick notes, the economy appears to be warming up, not slowing down, and importantly the bull market is actually quite young. “That’s right, a two-year bull market historically has plenty of life left, with the average bull market since 1950 lasting more than five years and gaining more than 180%,” he says. Detrick reminds us that the market Cassandras have been consistently vocal during this current rally. He recalls that a year ago there were many observers saying that a relatively weak first year of a bull market — stocks were up about 20% — meant the recovery could not be sustained. “We noted this was probably the wrong way to look at it and suggested being open to the possibility of huge gains in year two. Well, after more than 30% gains during the second year of the bull market we would say that indeed was the way to look at things,” Detrick says. Of course, the crucial question for investors is whether they’ll be celebrating the bull’s third birthday. Detrick thinks they will, though history suggests traders should not expect such big gains. “We found that out of 16 previous bull markets (after bear or near bear markets), 12 of them made it to their third birthday, with an average gain of about 8% and a median return of nearly 10% in year three, pretty much what your average year does,” says Detrick.

Things were decidedly not normal, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. Of course, all of this affected the fashion industry from the brands and retailers to the textile manufacturers, the mills and farmers that produce natural fibers like cotton. Subsequent sourcing interruptions, inflation and concerns about recession were some of the pandemic’s lasting effects. But now, experts say it seems we’re “coming back to normal.” More from Sourcing Journal These Were the Men's Cotton and Denim Looks Coming Out of Fashion Week How Accessibility and Awareness Can Catapult Circular Change The Surprising Ways Gen Z is Shopping Now And that’s good news as the industry recently acknowledged the third official United Nations World Cotton Day on Oct. 7. The day is meant to acknowledge that “cotton is more than just a commodity. This natural fabric is a life-changing product worldwide that sustains 32 million growers (almost half of them women) and benefits over 100 million families across 80 countries in five continents.” In his last Monthly Economic Letter, Cotton Incorporated’s Jon Devine, senior economist in the corporate strategy and program metrics division, states that after several months of decline, cotton prices stabilized in August. “Things have been tougher for U.S. growers because prices are down,” Devine told the Lifestyle Monitor™ in an interview. “But for manufacturers, they should gradually see things come back to normal. The orders were overbooked up to the first half of 2022, but it’s been really quiet since then because inflation and higher interest rates raised concerns about recession. As we move beyond those fears, we should see a return to more predictable business conditions. This should be a relief because the volume on orders has been switching back and forth between zero and 10 in recent years. If orders can settle back at a comfortable six or seven and be less herky-jerky, it will bring more clarity and more ability to plan.” And retailers should be planning for a solid fourth quarter, according to the National Retail Federation’s Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist. “The momentum of the economy during the third quarter looks decent even though the labor market is showing some weakness,” Kleinhenz told the Monitor™ in an interview. “Consumers have remained resilient and have been driving the economy. Spending for the first eight months of the year is very much in line with NRF’s 2024 forecast of retail sales growth between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent, which is great, although a bit of a slower pace than last year. The holiday shopping season is just around the corner, and we believe consumers will remain engaged for the holiday season.”                           ",

This is part of efforts to prepare for its next growth phase, which includes achieving an annual recurring revenue of $5 billion. Desai is a high-profile tech executive who has a track record for driving innovation at scale. Most recently, he served as President and Chief Operating Officer at ServiceNow (NOW) and helped scale the company from $1.5 billion to more than $10 billion in annualized revenue. During his time at ServiceNow, he oversaw products, platform, design, engineering, customer support, cloud infrastructure operations, and customer success. Many have pointed out that he's been quoted almost as often as the CEO, especially with regards to product details and updates. Before assuming the ServiceNow COO role, Desai was Chief Product Officer. In a blog post, he wrote about joining Cloudflare. \"The world is in a very interesting moment for technological innovation: the AI landscape is uncharted and developing at an exponential rate; the urgency for enterprises to reduce tech debt and reliance on legacy applications is at an all time high; multi-cloud deployments are becoming a reality for optimal performance and global scale; and high performance connectivity is table stakes. Cloudflare finds itself in a compelling position at the intersection of these key themes.\" Is now the time to buy Cloudflare? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Cloudflare’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock gained 5.2% as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent). The Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years. The Fed—under Chair Jerome Powell—began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot. Looking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25.     ",

JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock shares climbed after beating earnings estimates. US stocks edged higher on Friday after Producer Price Index data for September came in lower than expected, signaling a continued cooling of wholesale inflation. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, Core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. TradeStation strategist David Russell told Business Insider the data supports another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. \"CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not. Overall, these numbers are getting less impactful as inflation moderates. The Fed could still be on track for 25 basis points at the next two meetings. Yields have surged lately, but it's not clear they have much more reason for continued upside,\" Russell said. Investors are also digesting earnings results from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock. All three stocks moved higher after the results, which beat analyst estimates on most fronts. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release, but warned that geopolitical conditions are \"treacherous and getting worse.\" Apart from earnings results, retail sales data, set to be released on October 17, is the next big data release for investors to watch.

In year-on-year (YoY) terms, sales volumes were down 4.8% — September 2023 being a relatively strong base for comparison as improved supply supported the fulfilment of backlogged orders. Sales in Germany remained disappointing as consumer confidence struggles. In what is a seasonally strong month for the UK, the selling rate fell back from recent levels, though YoY growth was in positive territory. Year-to-date (YTD), the Western European market is now flat in comparison to last year (+0.3%). The big picture within the industry remains the same. Strong vehicle pricing, high interest rates, and a lack of incentives, continue to restrict sales. Some improvement is expected moving in 2025 as monetary policy easing supports broad economic expansion. Commentary The PV selling rate for Western Europe fell to 11.3 mn units/year in September. Our outlook for the full year remains subdued, and these incoming figures cement our expectation that the market will not pass 2023’s result. We continue to assume improved market activity in 2025 as the economy picks up, and a more favourable vehicle pricing evolution for consumers. Geopolitical issues, as well as political and economic uncertainty, provide downside risk. The German PV market registered 209k units in September, a 7% decline YoY. The selling rate fell further by 6% MoM to 2.54 million units. Year-to-date sales are now 2.1 million units. Weaker consumer confidence, a staggering economy and a lack of incentives currently continue to have negative effects on the automotive market. Italy’s PV market fell again in September as new car registrations were down 10.7% YoY to 122k units. The selling rate fell by 11% MoM to 1.55 million units. The broader economic challenges in Italy, coupled with difficulties in production, further contributed to the downturn in car sales. The French PV market declined 11.1% YoY to 139k units. The selling rate remained broadly flat at 1.74 million units/year. This is the fifth consecutive month that PV sales have fallen in France in comparison to last year. A lack of subsidies and political uncertainty, especially regarding the fiscal deficit, continue to dampen consumer confidence. The UK PV market registered 275k units September, a 1% increase YoY. The new number plate number month of September is traditionally a bumper month along with March. This was the best performance since 2020; however, was still nearly 20% lower than pre-Covid September 2019. Private consumer demand fell, while fleet purchases continued growth seen in previous months. YTD sales have reached 1.51 million units, a 4.3% increase YoY. Private BEV demand remains down YTD and highlights concerns regarding the future mandated targets. The Spanish PV market registered 73k units in September, a 6.3% increase YoY. Additionally, the selling rate increased by 23% MoM to 1.17 million units/year. Year-to-date sales are now 745k units, a 4.7% increase YoY. The increase in registrations this month saw car rental companies as the main driver of this growth. Despite this, the private channel has performed well.      ",

            "TipRanks"
        ],
        "created_at": "2024-10-11T00:00:00.000Z",
        "body": "SoFi Technologies (SOFI) has positioned itself as one of the most exciting fintech companies, offering a wide range of services and products that many traditional banks struggle to match. While the stock has declined by about 10% this year, I believe this decline is largely due to investors’ short-term preoccupation with challenges, particularly the high-interest rate environment that is now beginning to change. In this article, I will outline five key reasons that support my bullish view of SOFI stock, especially at current levels. The first tenet of my SoFi investment thesis is its impressive top-line growth. In its most recent Q2 results, reported on July 30, SoFi delivered a strong 22% year-over-year increase in adjusted net revenue, reaching a record $597 million. Furthermore, its financial services and technology platform revenue grew by 46% year-over-year and now comprises 45% of total adjusted net revenue, up from just 38% a year ago. This diversification away from lending and toward financial services and technology platforms boosts SoFi’s growth potential and reduces its reliance on a single revenue stream, making the company more resilient. Additionally, SoFi has carved out a niche in financial services by targeting a high-income, young demographic often underserved by traditional banks. While most large banks offer limited specialized services, SoFi provides a comprehensive range of offerings, from student loans to estate planning, allowing it to cater to the specific needs of this demographic. In addition to strong top-line growth, SoFi has been making significant strides in profitability. The fintech has posted three consecutive quarters of profitability, with $17 million of GAAP net income for the 3 months ending in June 2024, compared to a $40 million loss in the year prior. This meaningful improvement drives investor confidence and demonstrates that SoFi’s business model is sustainable and capable of scaling profitably over time. Moreover, SoFi’s focus on product development, along with its commitment to operational efficiency, is poised to drive long-term growth and profitability. Wall Street shares this optimism, projecting robust earnings growth over the next 3 years from $0.11 EPS for 2024 to $0.64 of EPS in 2027. This underscores the company’s strong future prospects. The company’s current valuation is also attractive relative to growth expectations. Currently, SoFi trades at a seemingly stretched forward P/E ratio of 78x. However, if SoFi does reach EPS of $0.64 by 2027, that multiple drops to 13.4x. That valuation is much closer to those of traditional banks, which typically trade at earnings multiples between 11x and 13x. That said, since SoFi’s business is far from mature, and earnings are just getting started, the current P/E ratio premium makes sense. My fourth bullish point is in regards SoFi’s rapid growth of its member base. In the second quarter of 2024, the company added 643,000 new members, representing a 41% year-over-year increase, bringing the total to 8.77 million members. SoFi’s digital-first approach also eliminates the need for brick-and-mortar locations and helps reduce costs while meeting consumer demand for convenient, tech-driven financial services. This strategy positions SoFi well to capitalize on the continued shift toward online banking and fintech innovation. The fifth argument underlying my bullish view of SoFi is potential macroeconomic relief. Management has been concerned over the past few quarters that higher interest rates could dampen economic activity, leading to job losses and missed loan payments. Consequently, management aimed to reduce lending, initially forecasting a decline in revenue of at least 5% for 2024. However, as the Fed cut interest rates by half a percentage point a few weeks ago, management’s outlook will likely improve. SoFi may have weathered the worst of the rising interest rate cycle. Lower interest rates typically improve economic activity, reducing the risk of loan losses. Despite diversification efforts, SoFi’s balance sheet remains heavily concentrated in lending, with a loan-to-asset ratio of approximately 77.4%. Management’s caution was justified, as an increase in defaults could seriously threaten results. Notably, the 90-day personal loan delinquency rate fell to 64 basis points in the most recent quarter, down from 72 basis points in Q1, indicating a potential peak in delinquencies. Despite the bullish arguments presented in this article, Wall Street remains cautious on SOFI stock. Of the 14 analysts covering the stock, only five recommend a Buy, six rate it as a Hold, and three suggest a Sell, resulting in an overall Hold consensus according to TipRanks. The average SOFI stock price target is $8.27, almost 5% lower than the recent market price. In summary, despite short-term challenges and cautious analyst sentiment, SoFi’s strong revenue growth, improving profitability, and strategic diversification make a compelling case for growth at a reasonable valuation for long-term investors. With a rapidly expanding member base and a digital-first strategy, I believe the company is well-positioned to thrive in the evolving fintech landscape. This warrants a bullish sentiment for SOFI stock at current prices. Disclosure Disclaimer ",

China's finance minister has called a fiscal policy briefing for Saturday against a backdrop of high expectations and jittery trade. Investors and, as of Thursday, Swedish furniture shop IKEA want fiscal stimulus to reinvigorate the economy. Markets are expecting Beijing to announce 2 trillion to 3 trillion yuan ($280-$420 billion) in new spending, and worries about whether it will deliver - after a similar disappointment from policymakers' briefing early this week - had Chinese equities falling on Friday. On the geopolitical front, Israel is mulling its response to an Iranian missile attack, and a retaliatory strike on oil or military targets would likely draw a sharp reaction in financial markets. Investors in Asia were taking chips off the table. Chinese stocks are set for a weekly drop as follow-up details on promises to support the economy have so far underwhelmed. Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday on Friday, leaving the Hang Seng nursing its largest weekly drop in two years as investors hit pause on one of its sharpest ever rallies. Gold was creeping higher. British monthly GDP data is due in the European session and, while it is hard to really gauge growth from monthly figures, signs of strength in the services sector may have investors dialling back expectations for interest rate cuts. Markets price about a 3/4 chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in November, while opinions at the Bank of England itself are also divided. Rate cuts should come gradually, BoE chief economist Huw Pill told the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last week, a day after Governor Andrew Bailey was quoted in the Guardian saying the central bank could move aggressively. Among U.S. earnings, J.P. Morgan, BNY and Wells Fargo are due before the open. Tesla shares may react to the long-awaited showcase of an autonomous taxi in Los Angeles, which came with fanfare but few details on timing. Production is not set to begin until 2026. U.S. producer prices data is also due and will frame expectations for the Federal Reserve's preferred PCE measure out later in the month. Slightly stronger-than-expected inflation in September has, for now, knocked out market expectations of anything more than a 25 bp interest rate cut at the Fed's November meeting.

Recommended Reading Weis Markets buys 2 supermarkets LAS VEGAS — Weis Markets was initially skeptical when Amazon came to it with a plan to fulfill delivery orders for the chain. But the grocer’s decision to accept the proposal has turned out to benefit the East Coast supermarket chain on several fronts, the company’s chief information officer said. The relationship with Amazon has helped Weis improve its in-store operations, gain more insight into its e-commerce business and reach shoppers in areas beyond the reach of its brick-and-mortar stores, Greg Zeh, senior vice president and CIO of Weis Markets, said during a Monday panel session at Groceryshop. “When Amazon approached us about becoming a grocery partner, they kind of gave us an idea [of] what they thought that sales volume might be, and we kind of looked at them … sideways and said, ‘We’re not sure if that makes sense or not,’” Zeh said. Weis is currently working with Amazon to service orders from 23 sites that represent 75% of the grocer’s footprint. Amazon can handle deliveries to customers living within a 52-minute radius of Weis’ stores, Zeh said. Weis has been able to tap Amazon’s e-commerce expertise to bring “some very good discipline to the organization” and help Weis’ team sharpen its ability to manage online orders, Zeh said. In an example of that, Weis workers have used metrics provided by Amazon to become more adept at picking products ordered by online shoppers, Zeh said. Weis is currently working with Amazon to service orders from 23 sites that represent 75% of the grocer’s footprint. Amazon can handle deliveries to customers living within a 52-minute radius of Weis’ stores, Zeh said. Zeh noted that third-party delivery providers account for about two-thirds of its e-commerce sales volume, with Amazon handling about a quarter of that business. Weis also works with e-commerce companies including Instacart, DoorDash, Uber Eats and Shipt. Weis, which is based in Pennsylvania and runs about 200 stores in seven states, has also been able to add shoppers in markets that were beyond its reach before it joined forces with Amazon, giving it an opportunity to add customers in more metropolitan areas to its footprint, Zeh said. That could help Weis build its e-commerce volume to the point that it might consider investing in micro-fulfillment equipment, he added.    ",

After a hot jobs report and a consumer inflation reading that didn’t put to bed concerns about rising prices, there’s more confusion than usual about what the Federal Reserve will do next with rates. Hopes for China stimulus and its ripple effect have sprung up, but the picture there remains murky as well, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in Chinese stocks. Throw in a couple of literal hurricanes and a figurative one in the Mideast, and investors have a lot to weigh when making decisions. Oh, and one more thing — the presidential election. Election years tend to be tough on October stock returns. “An upcoming US Election, a surprise stimulus from China and a broadening Middle East conflict will continue to exaggerate the Macro, and its very uncertain uncertainties, over Micro this Earnings season,” Evercore ISI’s Julian Emanuel wrote in a recent note to clients. It’s that typical election-related weakness that’s causing Emanuel to expect the S&P 500 will test 5,538 before climbing toward 6,000. Indeed, as earnings reports start to roll out, first from the banks today and then broadening out next week, Bank of America thinks investors will be looking past the current noise. “I think this earnings season is going to be pretty tricky,” Ohsung Kwon, US and Canada equity strategist at Bank of America, said in a recent interview. “I don't think the big focus is on Q3. Everyone basically knows that Q3 wasn't a very strong macro environment … So I don't think the bar is that high, but also the focus isn't really about Q3. It's really about companies' outlook on the other side of the curve. Now that the easing cycle has started, what are companies going to say about any early indications of improvement given the lower rate environment?” All of that said, stocks could still benefit from estimate-beating numbers and raised forecasts, Kwon wrote in a note to investors. He expects earnings for the S&P 500 to have risen 4% year over year in the third quarter, a sharp slowdown from the 11% gain in the second. (Evercore puts the predicted gain at 6.5%). Wherever the various strategists’ forecasts land, “As long as companies have managed through macro headwinds and see early signs of improvement from lower rates, stocks should get rewarded,” Kwon wrote.

This product aligns with the company's strategy to generate recurring revenue and is expected to be compatible with various life-support machines, potentially addressing the $1bn perfusion systems market. The disposable kit is a single-use product that alerts medical teams to any changes in performance during operation and treatment. Its unique design is intended to offer a smart, adaptable experience for users. Inspira Technologies co-founder and CEO Dagi Ben-Noon said: “This new innovation and capability, being integrated into our disposable kit, is expected to be an additional step by Inspira to provide new technologies and user experiences for the purpose of supporting improved safety and patient care.” Inspira is preparing to submit an application for US FDA clearance to market the disposable kit. Upon approval, the kit will be available for hospitals using the INSPIRA ART100 system. The ART100 system received FDA 510(k) clearance for cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in May this year. The company expects the first devices to be deployed in the US by the end of 2024. Inspira received approval from the Israeli Ministry of Health for its INSPIRA ART100 system in July this year. The company has developed INSPIRA ART with the aim of transforming the $19bn mechanical ventilation market.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Shenzhen Huaan Hexin Private Investment Fund Management Co., which manages almost 6 billion yuan ($849 million), is adding such holdings after a 14% two-day slump in the Hang Seng Tech Index earlier this week. “Such a correction is more like a buying opportunity,” Yuan Wei, founder and fund manager, said in an interview on Wednesday. “If you compare to their fundamentals, the stocks remain very cheap.” The firm’s flagship Huaan Hexin Stable fund surged 35% in the final week of September after internet stocks like Meituan rallied, extending this year’s return to 60% as of Sept. 30. That pushed its total gain since inception seven years ago to 825%, according to data compiled by Shenzhen PaiPaiWang Investment & Management Co., which tracks Chinese hedge funds. Chinese tech stocks have soared since the government announced an economic stimulus package, fueling gains at long-only hedge funds like Huaan Hexin that have placed heavy bets on a sector once favored by short sellers. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks 30 Chinese tech firms traded in Hong Kong, surged more than 50% since mid-September before paring gains this week. “The market is just rebounding from an extremely bearish level to a level that’s still undervalued,” Yuan said. While further upside partly depends on the effects of the stimulus measures on the economy, internet firms have seen turning points in profitability since last year, he said. The boost from an improving industry environment can offset any pressure on earnings from the economic slowdown, rendering firms like Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan “safe havens,” he added. “Their profit elasticity by far exceeds the impact from macroeconomic volatilities,” Yuan said. “And if the economy improves, they benefit as well.” Yuan said his positions are primarily in Hong Kong-traded stocks and mostly held since last year, without providing details. The company has recently started buying shares of a Chinese manufacturing firm due to its growth prospects and low valuations, he said, declining to name the target.          ",

        "body": "Hurricane Milton struck Florida's central west coast as a dangerous Category 3 storm on Oct. 9. As Floridians braced for the hurricane's landfall, airlines canceled hundreds of flights and cruise lines shifted routes. At least 16 cruise ships are directly affected, and some cruises advised that they did not expect to be able to return to port until Oct. 12, Florida's Maritime Executive newspaper reported. The Florida cruise industry is just entering its busy season, which generally aligns with winter as travelers from colder regions, especially the northern U.S. and Canada, flock south to warmer weather and the Caribbean. Despite the disruptions, analysts remain optimistic about the cruise industry’s resilience, lifting stock price targets for the major cruise lines. Cruise lines were particularly vulnerable when operations were halted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, analysts are seeing growth driven by strong demand from U.S. customers, who continue to travel despite economic uncertainties. Image source: Dan Kline/Come Cruise With Me Citigroup on Oct. 9 updated share-price targets on Carnival  (CCL) , Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The analyst is optimistic that the cruise-sector rally will extend into 2025 and beyond, thefly.com reported. All three stocks are up more than 20% in the past month. Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian Cruise Line are the biggest market players in the cruise line industry. According to Cruise Market Watch, in 2024 Carnival and its sub-brands accounted for 37.3% of the industry’s revenue, with Royal Caribbean Group at 23.9% and Norwegian at 14.1%. Citi raised its price target on Carnival to $28 from $25 and affirmed a buy rating on the shares. Related: Analysts retool Carnival stock price targets ahead of earnings The analyst said Carnival has strong potential for revenue growth, citing recent positive trends in the company’s performance and the anticipated benefits from assets like Celebration Key, the line’s new private island destination in the Bahamas. Celebration Key is set to open in July. On Sept. 30, Carnival reported that for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31, net income surged 60% from a year earlier to $1.7 billion as revenue increased 14% to $7.9 billion. Citi also says Carnival could sacrifice sales growth and focus on reducing debt and interest payments. Although Carnival has posted impressive financial results, it remains burdened by substantial debt. Carnival’s debt reached its peak at $35.14 billion in Q1 2023. As of Aug. 31, it still has nearly $29 billion in total debt. But if interest rates ease, Carnival could benefit from reduced debt repayments, particularly when it refinances or issues new debt.                  ",

Of the top ten brands, Jeep demonstrated the standout growth in BEV retail sales with a staggering 420% increase in new registrations, albeit from a low baseline in 2023. Close behind was BMW, with a 402% increase, establishing itself as a premium competitor to Tesla. Conversely, MG faced significant challenges, seeing the largest market decline at 46%. Tesla, despite retaining its position as the third best-selling brand, experienced a 40% year-on-year drop, falling behind Peugeot and Renault in their home market. However, 2024 has been less favourable for the Model Y, with new registrations down by 34% as of August, leading to a decline in market share to 8%. Despite these challenges, it remains the second most popular BEV model in France, just behind the Peugeot 208. To counter this trend, Tesla launched short-term finance offers for September 2024, including easy lease and classic credit options, to stimulate demand and clear inventory before the anticipated arrival of a refreshed Model Y in the first half of 2025. This strategic move also aimed to clear inventory build-up of the current Model Y versions in September, with a view to closing the order books for the third quarter of 2024 on a strong note. It also reflected anticipation of the arrival of the restyled Model Y next year. Tesla’s headline LOA (easy lease) offer, which gave the customer a purchase option if they wished to own the vehicle, started at a monthly payment rate of €299 per month with an OEM discount, or ‘Tesla bonus’, of €4,000. This discount was on top of the €4,000 ecological bonus available from the government for qualifying versions.

        "body": " Most exchange-traded fund investors say that economic and political events such as high inflation and the election have had no effect on how they invest in ETFs, according to a new report by Charles Schwab Asset Management. ETF investors are more enthusiastic about tech and growth stocks than they were last year. Younger generations of investors are more likely than older generations to express interest in investments like crypto and alternative ETFs. Millennials also want to increase their allocation to fixed-income ETFs.  Market volatility, high interest rates, inflation and the upcoming presidential election haven't affected the investment strategies of most exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. Most ETF investors surveyed by Charles Schwab (SCHW) Asset Management said that these economic and political events did not change the way they invest in ETFs. In fact, roughly a third of the investors put more money into ETFs based on their reading of stock market volatility, high interest rates and persistent inflation, according to the survey results released this week. ETFs have a track record across market cycles, said David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Innovation and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, adding that \"investors are confident in their investments even when the outlook is uncertain.” ETF investors have grown more bullish on certain types of stocks and sectors since last year: 69% are bullish on technology and 60% on growth stocks. Additionally, 55% of investors are optimistic about the the Magnificent 7, a group of seven mega-cap technology companies including Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). The Mag 7 stocks have a big influence on the stock markets and have driven much of the S&P 500's returns over the past year. But when they falter, as they did in July this year, they tend to drag the broader stock market down with them. The survey also showed how investment preferences vary across generations. For instance, 62% of millennials (or those born between 1981 and 1996), said they plan to invest in cryptocurrency ETFs over the next year versus 15% of Boomers (or those born between 1946 and 1964). A quarter of millennials said they plan to invest in alternatives ETFs, compared with just 11% of boomers. At the same time, 44% of millennials also want to increase their exposure to lower-risk fixed income ETFs. In contrast, fewer GenX (34%) and Boomer (26%) investors plan to do likewise.   ",

The company expects third-quarter net revenue of $302 million – $309 million versus the consensus of $289.37 million. Also, Indivior trimmed its FY24 net revenue outlook to $1.125 billion – $1.165 billion (consensus $1.185 billion) from $1.15 billion – $1.215 billion. In particular, the company now expects lower-than-anticipated net revenue for SUBLOCADE, with projected net revenue of $187 million – $192 million in the third quarter and $725 million – $745 million (versus $765 million to $805 million expected earlier) for FY24. Mark Crossley, CEO of Indivior, stated, “We are seeing faster than expected initial adoption of the competitive product to SUBLOCADE. This dynamic, together with greater variability in the timing of funding among Criminal Justice System customers, as well as incremental trade stocking pressure, has resulted in net revenue below our expectations set out in July. We are reducing our FY 2024 guidance to reflect these impacts.” Also, looking to the year ahead, the company expects pressure on SUBLOCADE volume growth from continued initial competitor adoption as the U.S. market adjusts to two long-acting injectable products. Indivior maintained its expectation for peak net revenue from SUBLOCADE to exceed $1.5 billion but no longer anticipates a run rate of $1 billion by the end of 2025. Crossle added, “We remain firm in our conviction that SUBLOCADE has a differentiated and optimal profile for opioid use disorder (OUD) patients, including our belief that it will best meet the increasing challenges that synthetic opioids are presenting to OUD patients and treatment providers.” ”Additionally, we expect SUBLOCADE’s profile to be further enhanced with important label updates in February 2025 that, if approved by the FDA, are expected to improve both the patient and healthcare provider experience.” Apart from this, the company reiterated outlook for an adjusted gross margin in low to mid 80% range and lowered adjusted operating profit guidance to $260 million – $280 million (from $285 million – $320 million) for 2024.

DUBAI — Crypto exchange OKX has gone live in the UAE offering a dirham (AED)-denominated order book and integration with a local bank as it looks to attract retail clients and entice institutions that may have been reluctant to participate in the crypto market. The opening, nine months after OKX Middle East Fintech FZE was granted full regulatory approval by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), will allow one of the four biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume to offer local residents access to a market without involving a broker who buys liquidity from outside the UAE, usually at a higher price, adding time and friction, said Rifad Mahasneh, the exchange's general manager for the Middle East. \"We have two targets – to be the retail app of choice and market and to start converting institutions in the UAE to enter the space,\" Mahasneh said in an interview. \"The return on investment is going to come from our ability to convert traditional institutions.\" The combination of giving access to a regulated derivatives product, local-currency product and local banking channel could give entities representing global institutions, which have so far been sitting on the sidelines, comfort to trade, Mahasneh said. The company's banking partner is Zand Bank, which calls itself the UAE's first fully licensed, all-digital bank. OKX is the first major exchange to go live with the combination of \"an AED banking integration and an AED order book,\" retail and institutional availability, and the first to offer regulated derivatives in the market, Mahasneh said. It will offer 280 tokens and 400 trading pairs in the region. Binance and Crypto.com are the other major international exchanges with full licenses from VARA. After announcing a partnership with Standard Chartered in August, Crypto.com's retail app is now available in the UAE, the company told CoinDesk in an email. Binance did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment about whether it had gone live in the UAE. VARA's public register shows OKX's license was issued Sept. 17. \"While that's VARA reflecting it's confident of you as a firm to operate in this space, the license comes with certain conditions that you need to complete before you go live,\" Mahasneh said. \"We wanted to test the product too.

        "body": "Nvidia stock is set for more gains as demand for its GPU chips surges, Morgan Stanley says. Nvidia's Blackwell GPU is on schedule and is sold out for the next 12 months, the company said. Inference computing growth boosts the long-term demand potential for Nvidia's AI GPU chips. Nvidia stock is poised for more gains as its GPU chip business continues to see surging demand. That's according to Morgan Stanley, which hosted meetings with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and other members of the chip maker's management team for three days in New York City this week. The key takeaway is that \"every indication from management is that we are still early in a long term AI investment cycle,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said. The bank reiterated its \"Overweight\" and \"Top Pick\" ratings and $150 price target, representing potential upside of 12% from current levels. Moore said Nvidia's production ramp of its next-generation Blackwell GPU chip is \"progressing on schedule,\" adding that the product is sold out for the next 12 months. \"Any new Blackwell orders now that aren't already in queue will be shipped late next year, as they are booked out 12 months, which continues to drive strong short term demand for Hopper which will still be a major factor through the year,\" Moore explained. Hopper is Nvidia's previous generation of AI-enabled GPU chips, which are being sold in clusters to cloud \"hyperscalers\" like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. And Nvidia has a new \"element\" to its story, according to Moore, which is the view that inference computing \"is starting to solve much more complex problems which will require a much richer mix of hardware.\" That should be a boon for Nvidia's GPU chip product set, according to the note. \"The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of \"digital AI employees\" that can execute challenging tasks,\" Moore said. He added: \"The notion that a more thoughtful, task oriented inference would cause an exponential jump in inference complexity strikes us an important new avenue for growth, and another clear area where NVIDIA's full stack approach to solving these problems adds to the company's considerable lead.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made it clear to Morgan Stanley that the company expects to see meaningful growth in 2025 that spills over into 2026, \"though he did not quantify,\" Moore said.

The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures expected one-month volatility on the S&P 500 Index, reached about 14 points above the 10-day realized volatility. It’s a level that’s only been exceeded for extended periods in 2008 and 2020-2021 during times when the market was recovering from severe selloffs as a result of the Global Financial Crisis and Covid. Robert Knopp, co-head of the S&P options desk at Optiver in Chicago, said upcoming events such as the US presidential election and earnings season are contributing to the spread. “While recent realized volatility is often predictive of upcoming realized volatility, in this case, these events are contributing to expectations of higher volatility,” he wrote. And while the divergence is not totally uncommon, the timing is. Usually the two measures have a bigger positive gap when tensions in the market are rising and the VIX Index is trading at higher levels. Even though the VIX has increased from the low levels seen from mid-2023 through mid-July, it’s just around the five-year average. Since the market volatility spike in early August, Knopp said there’s been a “combination of greater demand for hedging together with less willingness from market participants to warehouse short-volatility positions at the same levels that we observed prior to August 5.” Some of the early-October increase of about 5 points in the VIX to above 20 may be mechanical, as S&P options around the Nov. 5 US election day became part of the index’s calculation. But it also signals investors are seeking some protection, with looming risks from geopolitical tension to interest rates, macro economic concerns and the upcoming earnings season, in addition to the presidential election. The S&P 500 Index, however, has been little changed as the benchmark consolidates near all-time highs. “Generally, a larger gap is often a bullish signal over medium-term horizons, like three to six months,” said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. “This is because the market tends to price in rising volatility risk, which often doesn’t materialize. The eventual resolution of these events could reduce volatility, leading to positive market returns.”        ",

The data do not include sales by Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Tesla and Nissan and a growing number of Chinese brands that have entered the market in the last two years, as well as domestic electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast. The market expanded for the sixth consecutive month in September from very weak year-earlier levels, after eighteen months of almost incessant declines. Heavy discounting by dealers helped support the market last month, as did the 50% vehicle registration tax discount introduced by the government in September and effective for three months. Third-quarter GDP growth came in at 7.4% year-on-year, up from 6.9% in the second quarter, driven by strong industrial output and exports - despite a series of powerful typhoons hitting the country in the last two months causing widespread damage and flooding. VAMA’s member data shows the market expanded by 2% to 193,854 units in the first nine month of 2024 from 190,130 a year earlier, including a 1% decline in passenger vehicle sales to 142,910 units while commercial vehicle sales increased by 12% to 50,944 units. Truong Hai (Thaco) group, the local assembler and distributor of several overseas brands and a major player in the commercial vehicle segment, reported a 10% drop in group sales to 60,546 units year-to-date. This includes an 18% drop in Kia sales to 22,948 units and an 11% fall in Mazda sales to 21,274 units, while sales of Thaco commercial vehicle increased by 6% to 12,858 units. Toyota’s nine-month volumes increased by 5% at 40,503 units, with sales of the Hilux pickup truck being stepped up in recent months. Ford, saw its sales rise by 6% to 28,038 units - underpinned by the popular Ranger, Everest and Transit models; while Mitsubishi’s sales increased by 29% to 27,933 units - lifted by the launch of the XForce SUV at the beginning of the year; followed by Honda with 17,654 units (+17%); and Suzuki with 7,985 units (-26%). The latest data released by Hyundai’s local distributor showed 34,389 vehicles were sold under the South Korean brand in the first eight months of 2024. VinFast said its global sales increased by 92% year-on-year to 21,747 units in the first half of 2024 and confirmed it is targeting 80,000 sales over the full year – in a growing number of markets in South-east Asia and the Middle-East as well as in the US. The Vietnamese government confirmed it will keep the registration tax for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) at 0% until 2026 while the special consumption tax will be kept at between 1% and 3%, as part of a broader package of incentives aimed at attracting BEV sector investment into the country – including cuts in import duties on components and charging equipment.

S&P 500 earnings are estimated to have increased 5.3% over the year-ago quarter, down from a second-quarter gain of 13.2%, but technology and communication services sectors are forecast to have the strongest year-over-year growth, according to LSEG data as of Friday. The earnings period unofficially kicks off this week, with reports from major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo due Friday. AI-related companies have dominated earnings since last year, and optimism over AI plans have helped to drive strong gains in the market. The S&P 500 is at record high levels and up roughly 21% for the year so far, with tech and communication services leading sector gains since Dec. 31. \"Many analysts will start looking at how and if a lot of these larger companies can monetize the model that they're training, and we've seen the ones that have been able to do so have been rewarded quite well,\" said Howard Chan, chief executive officer of Kurv Investment Management in San Francisco. Technology sector earnings in aggregate are expected to have gained 15.4% from the year-ago quarter, while communication services earnings are seen up 12.3%, based on LSEG data. Shares of Meta Platforms jumped on Aug. 1, a day after it issued an upbeat sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its AI investments. \"Companies like Microsoft and Google, they're spending quite a bit, but it's a little bit less understood... how that will interplay with their existing businesses,\" Chan said. Investors may also be hoping earnings can justify higher stock prices. With the S&P 500 at record high levels, the index is now trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note Wednesday that third-quarter results could provide a catalyst for gains as investors focus on tech fundamentals and AI. \"We continue to favor the semiconductor space and megacaps for AI exposure,\" she wrote, noting that she expects tech and AI companies to beat results for the quarter ended in September and also raise their outlooks.

Orano is also developing new projects in Mongolia and Uzbekistan, while remaining “in monitoring mode” for potential acquisitions, he said. “We have interest in diversifying our projects as there are some tensions in the East and in Africa,” Maes said at the company’s uranium enrichment plant in central France. “Questions over where uranium will come from in the next decade are pulling prices higher.” Uranium has soared over the past three years as investors piled into the commodity and governments from China to Europe plan more nuclear power plants, partly to curb carbon emissions. At the same time, production issues in Kazakhstan and a military coup in Niger have impacted uranium output.

That production can’t be exported out of the landlocked African nation due to persisting geopolitical issues, he added. The cost of enriching uranium — a key step to transform the radioactive metal into fuel — has also jumped since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as some western utilities seek to replace Kremlin-controlled Rosatom for their processing requirements. To help fill that gap, Orano broke ground on the expansion of its French enrichment facility this year. It expects to boost its global market share of enrichment services to 16% from 12%, when the project is completed by the end of the decade, the CEO said. Rosatom is the world’s largest enricher of uranium, with 43% of total production capacity, according to Orano. That’s followed by Urenco Ltd., a UK-Dutch-German group with a 31% share, and China National Nuclear Corp. with 13%.          ",

Investors also channelised capital into liquid money market funds as they awaited a much-anticipated update on Beijing's stimulus measures this weekend. According to LSEG data, global money market funds gained a net $24.55 billion worth of inflows during the week after witnessing about $22.78 billion of net purchases in the prior week. Investors readjusted their views on future Fed rate cuts last week following a stronger than expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for the last month, boosting demand for low-risk assets. Asian money market funds saw a significant $12.88 billion inflow, the highest since Jan. 10. European and U.S. funds also witnessed $7.78 billion and $2.54 billion worth of net purchases, respectively. Demand for riskier equity funds, however, cooled as investors purchased just $3.65 billion of global equity funds compared with $35.97 billion of net acquisitions in the prior week. Tech, financials, and metals and mining sector funds received a notable $572 million, $417 million and $148 million, respectively, while the healthcare sector suffered $520 million worth of net sales. Overseas China equity funds attracted a sharp $8.52 billion, the biggest amount for a week since at least December 2020. Global bond funds attracted investments for the 42nd consecutive week as investors pumped $12.43 billion into these funds. Investors snapped up short-term bond funds of a net $2.16 billion following $3.3 billion of net sales a week ago. Government, high yield, and loan participation funds, meanwhile, experienced $1.96 billion, $906 million and $737 million worth of net purchases, respectively. Gold and other precious metal funds retained their appeal for a ninth successive week, attracting about $780 million in inflows. Energy funds, however, saw a marginal outflow of $11 million. Data covering 29,545 emerging market funds showed equity funds attracted a massive $8.55 billion, the largest amount since January 2021. Investors also purchased $1.76 billion of bond funds.

Boeing had roughly 171,000 employees as of December 2023, according to an SEC filing. \"We've got an aircraft manufacturer that's in very, very deep trouble. What they did here is not a drill,\" Mike Boyd, president of aviation consulting firm Boyd Group International, told Yahoo Finance on Friday following the job cut announcement. An ongoing strike by Boeing's biggest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), is proving costly on several fronts for the company. The work stoppage has interrupted the company's recovery efforts, which include ramping up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets to 38 per month by the end of the year, up from roughly 25 per month in June and July. Estimates from S&P Global put the cost of the strike at roughly $1 billion per month after taking into consideration cost-saving measures the company has taken in response to it. Earlier this week, the credit rating agency placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the work stoppage continues until the end of the year. Riskier credit makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to borrow money. S&P expects Boeing will incur a cash outflow of approximately $10 billion in 2024. As a result, Wall Street analysts expect Boeing will need to raise cash through an equity offering. At the end of the second quarter, Boeing had roughly $58 billion in total debt and $12.6 billion in cash. “Based on our conversations with investors, it should be no surprise that Boeing is looking at an equity raise. We think most investors have been expecting the company to raise more than $10B, most likely following the conclusion of the machinists strike,\" JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman and his team wrote in a recent note. The analysts note the size of the raise could be determined by how long the strike lasts, and investors would be more reluctant to sign on with one still underway.             ",

Projects in the space are creating technologies that stand to change, at least to a degree, the reigning cloud computing model, while providing users with sustainable economic incentives to uphold the networks. This could be the basis for new models of economic development. The decentralization of cloud computing is the creation of a two-sided marketplace. Node networks, the most common infrastructure underpinning DePIN projects, are an efficient and secure way for users to actually own parts of the network. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure. Physical assets like telecom infrastructure or video streaming networks can be divided up, apportioned and owned by node owners for a small profit. Users then pay to access that network that is sustained by the many, instead of owned by the few. We need to consider the importance of node operators to a local economy and local innovations. DePIN networks might actually enable the little guy to win, for once. For example, Helium’s network is being deployed for livestock tracking in Africa, helping to protect endangered species while supporting farmers’ livelihoods. Helium CEO Abhay Kumar CEO noted that: \"The cow in this case, or the livestock in this case, is sort of the center of the economy for this community.” Indeed, this is a local innovation born from DePIN. In the emerging markets, physical infrastructure is unreliable or even nonexistent. Those markets therefore stand to be the first mover of mass adoption of decentralized networks of nodes. This is because nodes can be a small business, akin to operating a produce stall or a bicycle repair shop. So we need to think of nodes as “micro businesses franchises” rather than an immediate cypherpunk global revolution in radical decentralization. DePIN is not a crypto gimmick; it’s actually a small business for node operators New ideas take time. Yet, technology is often adopted much faster in the emerging markets. Banking adoption in Africa skipped internet banking and went straight to mobile banking. Localized innovations meant African payments and credit business models emerged. This is how we should think about DePIN, a slow revolution that the big tech giants won’t see coming as it emerges gradually through various local drivers in certain geographies. Drivers such as the utility of operating a computing node as a small business. The DePIN supply-side business model is already slowly changing how we think about ownership of physical infrastructure networks. Still, on the demand side for Westerners this might not yet be a revolutionary moment. I’ll just stick with Zoom or Telegram and rely on AWS Cloud, thanks. Just a side hustle for Western node operators, this could be a personal finance game changer for node operators in emerging markets.              ",

Jacques said a group of works from young artist Sophie Birber was sold, with prices rang from 9,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds. The gallery also sold a painting from Nicola L. for $125,000 and a piece from Ana Mendieta sold for $75,000. Lisa De Simone, a representative from Elliott Fine Art, said “the beauty of London is that it’s a true melting pot. We’ve talked to people from so many different regions such as Europe, North and South America and Asia.” The gallery put a focus on female artists who have been previously neglected in history, but who are now being rediscovered, and celebrated. The works of Françoise Gilot, Giovanna Garzoni and Suzanne Fabry were on display, with the latter’s “Triple self portrait” selling for 50,000 pounds. The D’Lan Contemporary gallery sold six paintings by Paddy Bedford, a contemporary Indigenous Australian painter and printmaker, for an undisclosed amount. The buyers were American and Australian.                              ",

        "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. presidential election, the most consequential vote for financial markets in an election-packed year, is weeks away. With Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a close race to win the Nov. 5 election, we look at what matters most for world markets. EUROPE IN THE BALANCE For European equity markets, a Trump victory could spell trouble for export-heavy sectors, particularly German automakers such as BMW but also LVMH and other luxury goods makers as concerns of renewed trade tensions loom. Barclays has warned of possible \"high single-digit\" percentage drops in European earnings should trade conflicts reignite. Trump has floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10-20% on virtually all imports to boost U.S. manufacturing. On the flip side, a Harris win would be a relatively better outcome for European equities. This could energize renewable energy, a possible tailwind for utilities with large U.S. projects like Orsted and Iberdrola. Over the longer term, however, her plans to raise corporate taxes from 21% to 28% could curb margins for American firms and European dollar earners alike. A further cut under Trump would likely be welcomed on both sides of the Atlantic. The election could have implications for the war in Ukraine. Trump and some Republicans in Congress have questioned the value of U.S. funding for Ukraine's two-year battle against Russia, while Democrats have pushed to bolster Ukraine. Aerospace and defense stocks have gained over 80%since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. CURRENCY SWINGS Trade tariffs are key for traders in the world's most-actively traded currencies. The euro, trading below September's 14-month peaks at around $1.09, is seen as being in the losing camp if a Trump win means higher universal tariffs. \"A Trump win, in the eyes of the market, would take euro/dollar down to the $1.05 area, whereas a win for Harris would see the rate move in the opposite direction, above $1.15,\" said BlueBay Asset Management CIO Mark Dowding. Geopolitical risks, especially in the Middle East, that trigger a surge in oil prices and hurt economic growth, also make the euro vulnerable, analysts said. ING added that a Trump win could also hurt the Australian and New Zealand dollars -- currencies of economies dependent on trade from China, a main target of higher tariffs. Around 37% of Australia's and 29% of New Zealand’s exports land in China, ING noted. The Swedish and Norwegian currencies were also seen as vulnerable to global trade dynamics, while Canada's dollar could suffer if a Harris win is viewed negatively for the U.S. economy.

        "body": "Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell by about 2.7% in overnight trading on brokerage firm Robinhood after the company’s robotaxi unveiling event late on Thursday failed to give investors confidence. What Happened: Tesla on Thursday unveiled a two-seater Cybercab that can drive itself and a robovan with no pedals that can accommodate about 20 passengers at an event in Los Angeles on Thursday. The event, however, was thin on details with the company not divulging the cost of the robovan. Musk also said that the smaller Cybercab will join the company’s autonomous taxi fleet only by 2026. The CEO further remarked that he is often optimistic about timelines, hinting at chances of delay. Don’t Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. Why It Matters: Tesla investors were hoping the robotaxi unveiling event would give the stock a much-needed boost after the company’s third-quarter delivery numbers announced earlier this month sent the stock on a downward journey. Tesla delivered 462,890 vehicles in the third quarter, marking an increase of 6.4% from the corresponding period last year, but below estimates. The company has previously said that it expects a lower delivery growth rate this year as compared to the last. However, it has not issued specific delivery guidance for the year. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Some analysts, including Deepwater Asset Management's Managing Partner Gene Munster, had expected Tesla to unveil a cheaper, mass-market EV at the event on Thursday in addition to the robotaxi to ramp delivery numbers in the coming year. Price Action: At the time of writing, the Tesla stock was down by 2.7% on overnight trading on Robinhood. Year-to-date, Tesla shares are down nearly 4%, after the stock closed down 0.95% at $238.77 on Thursday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The population of the city stood at 59,471 in 2023, representing a 2.7% increase from the prior year and 9.8% jump from 2020, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Bentonville is located in Northwestern Arkansas, a fast-growing region where companies like Walmart, J.B. Hunt and Tyson Foods all have their headquarters. A forecast from the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission suggested over 1 million could call Northwest Arkansas home by 2050.

Read On The Fox Business App \"We’re the home of Walmart, and we’re the home of J.B. Hunt and also the home of Tyson, and Walmart has spent a ton of energy in making this a very recruitable place,\" The Agency Bentonville Managing Partner Kaala House told FOX Business. \"Our market is growing so intensely, especially starting after COVID because a lot of people wanted to get out of the city where they could be outside and things like that. We have become, in the last couple years, we’ve become the mountain biking capital of the United States in Bella Vista. And so that’s making us extremely recruitable for Walmart, who’s bringing back their employees as well.\" The real estate market around Bentonville has seen an 8.5% increase in home sales in the first half of 2024 from a year ago, The Agency Bentonville agent Katlyn Munch said. Benton County, where Bentonville is located, and two nearby counties notched 4,799 home sales over the first six months of the year, according to a recent Skyline Report from Arvest Bank and the University of Arkansas published online by NWAHomepage. That figure represented a 2.7% rise from the latter half of 2023, the report found. Munch also noted 39.5% of all homes sold were new construction. \"We’re at an all-low inventory rate. There’s a lot of people that are holding on to that COVID two-point interest rate, and so we’ve got a lot of people that are holding their homes that they don’t want to sell because they have such a great rate, and then the prices have gone up so much since that time too,\" House said. \"So we have a lot of new construction inventory right now. I think the average was, if we closed 29 new houses a day, we wouldn’t have enough houses, because we average 37 people-a-day increase in population.\" Bentonville has \"a little bit more\" of a buyer’s market at the moment, she said, citing interest rates, the upcoming election and other factors.

Stocks are at records, corporate bonds show no signs of worry and commodities remain buoyant on global economic optimism. Most Read from Bloomberg The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Drill down though, and the outlook quickly turns murky. Alongside all the outward cheer, volatility is an equally big story in almost every asset class. Traders, who got blindsided when things turned violently against them in August and September, are piling into hedges — pushing the cost of protection up almost as fast as markets themselves. The rush is creating unusual contours across assets. In one example, volatility indexes in equities and Treasuries just capped two of their bigger weekly advances of the year. The runups left both fear gauges at their highest in more than two decades — when plotted against other periods when the S&P 500 sat at a record. All in, sentiment remains febrile among key constituencies on Wall Street, thanks to next month’s US election, the uncertain Federal Reserve policy trajectory and recent market traumas. “The odds that a low-probability, very bad event will happen are higher,” said Amy Wu Silverman, head of derivatives strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “Post the August VIX spike markets have normalized and made new highs. Yet, the underlying ‘worry’ had remained elevated.” While asset prices frequently rise at times of investor anxiety, the situation now is especially extreme, with bullishness and skepticism both evident in equal parts. The S&P 500 has risen for five straight weeks and in eight of the last nine, closing Friday at its 45th record of the year after earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. topped estimates. US investment-grade bond spreads are the narrowest in more than three years. At the same time, with market plunges of early August and September fresh in traders’ minds, gauges of investor nervousness are flashing readings of caution that are rare during bullish regimes. Both the Cboe Volatility Index in equities and the ICE BofA MOVE Index in Treasuries have risen sharply since the start of the month. A global measure of cross-asset risk kept by Bank of America Corp. has hit the second-highest level of the year — eclipsed by only the early August selloff, which erased trillions of dollars from global share values in a matter of days. The indicator tracks stress across global equities, rates, currencies and commodities and measures future price swings implied by options.                  ",

Equity traders worried that the start of Federal Reserve rate cuts would sap bank profits saw things weren’t that bad, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. churning out a surprise increase in net interest income. At Wells Fargo & Co., NII slumped — but the firm expects that drop to be less steep in the last quarter. Each stock rose at least 4.4%, pushing the KBW Bank Index to the highest since April 2022. “We expect earnings season to be solid, including the big banks,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Credit card delinquencies are still very low and increased economic activity should drive bank revenues.” The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, extending gains into a fifth straight week — its longest winning run since May. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1%. The Russell 2000 climbed 2.1%. Tesla Inc. dropped 8.8% after the unveiling of its Robotaxi was light on specifics. Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. jumped over 9.5%. Treasuries saw small moves, with shorter maturities outperforming. A Bloomberg gauge of US bonds posted a fourth straight week of declines. The dollar barely budged, while capping a second consecutive week of gains in anticipation of a slower pace of rate cuts. West Texas Intermediate oil settled below $76 a barrel. “Now that the Fed has started its rate-cutting cycle, the economy should get a further boost from lower interest rates on things like credit card debt and business loans,” said David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management. “As a result, we expect third-quarter earnings results will be consistent with recent, healthy trends.” In non-recessionary scenarios, the S&P 500 rises 17% on average in the 12 months after the Fed starts to cut rates, Lefkowitz noted. He reiterated his S&P 500 price targets of 5,900 and 6,200 for December 2024 and June 2025. Apollo’s Torsten Slok noted that financials have been among top outperformers during the Fed’s rate cutting cycles that end with a “soft landing.”                                           ",

        "body": " Tesla shares sank Friday, the morning after its \"Cybercab\" robotaxi was unveiled at its \"We, Robot\" event. The electric vehicle maker also revealed a larger \"Robovan\" and showcased its Optimus humanoid robot. Analysts had said prior to the event that they expected Tesla could announce a lower-cost vehicle to be released next year, but the company did not mention one.  Tesla (TSLA) shares stumbled Friday morning as markets appeared to be initially unimpressed with the electric vehicle (EV) maker's \"We, Robot\" event last night, which included the unveiling of autonomous taxi and van models. The autonomous taxi, called the \"Cybercab,\" will go into production by 2026 once Tesla has approval from regulators for its full self-driving software, which Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk said should be rolled out in California and Texas by next year for its Model 3 and Model Y. At the event, Musk also revealed the \"Robovan,\" a larger autonomous vehicle designed to carry groups of people or cargo, along with showcasing Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot, with some helping serve drinks, dance, and perform other functions. The van and robot have not received official release dates, but Musk had said previously that Optimus would perform tasks in Tesla factories next year and would be sold to other companies in 2026. One factor pressuring Tesla's stock could be that analysts had said they expected the company could reveal a lower-cost vehicle that could be released next year. Wedbush analysts said in a Friday note that the lack of a \"Model 2\" announcement is the \"elephant in the room this morning,\" as they also acknowledged that Musk and Tesla \"ideally\" should have spent more time on details like how the robotaxi network will operate. However, the Wedbush analysts said they would \"be buyers on any weakness this morning\" as they left the \"We, Robot\" event \"more bullish on the Tesla story.\" Bank of America analysts affirmed their \"buy\" rating on Tesla's stock, saying the \"Robotaxi event lived up to the hype.\" Tesla stock has been trending lower since third-quarter deliveries data released last week beat estimates but perhaps by not as wide a margin as investors had hoped. The EV maker faces another catalyst for its shares later this month, when it reports Q3 earnings Oct. 23. Tesla shares, which recently fell back into negative territory for the year, were down more than 8% at $218.81 soon after markets opened Friday.   ",

Recommended Reading United Airlines takes flight with airline industry’s first media network NEW YORK — United Airlines in June unveiled Kinective Media, billed as the airline industry’s first media network. Drawing insights and data from 110 million travelers and 40 million MileagePlus frequent flyers, the offering quickly partnered with brands including Norwegian Cruise Line, Macy’s, Chase United Co-Brand Credit Cards and more. Mike Petrella was hired as managing director of strategic partnerships in September 2023 and has served as a key leader in the development of Kinective Media. Previously, the executive spent 23 years in the same corporate ecosystem, from being the third employee at Advertising.com through acquisitions by AOL and Yahoo. Petrella was “amazed” at how dynamic United was expanding into a white space area as a nearly 100-year-old company. “I thought I was coming into an old school environment, but even our CEO is very forward thinking,” Petrella said. “The way he communicates to his leadership team is very ‘fail first, fail fast, fail forward,’ and I wasn’t expecting that.” Marketing Dive spoke with Petrella between sessions at Advertising Week New York about the lessons he learned from helping stand up a media offering, the need for data privacy legislation and where the media landscape goes from here. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. MIKE PETRELLA: You need buy-in from everyone and I think that was the thing that was most impressive to me with the team. There was a willingness to be educated and influenced. One of my friends gave me the best advice: You may not know all the answers, but you know the questions to ask. You have to educate yourself in terms of the other building blocks. So from a data perspective, where is our data set today, where do we want it to go tomorrow? As we build a sales organization, how do we build in such a manner that is conducive and complementary to what we’ve stood up ahead of their presence? We were smart in terms of the choices we made, because it allowed us to be dynamic and fluid. We didn’t get locked into anything, and that was the key. In this industry, everything changes and nothing changes all at once, but you have to be able to pivot quickly.                  ",

The revelation comes following a lawsuit filed in an Illinois district court Thursday evening by crypto derivatives exchange Bitnomial, which sued Wall Street’s top cop over its claim that it has jurisdiction over a planned futures contract that tracks the price of XRP, the seventh-largest digital asset by market cap. Bitnomial, which is regulated by the SEC’s sister agency the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, filed for the XRP US Dollar Futures contract in August following the conclusion of the SEC’s lawsuit against blockchain payments firm Ripple, where a federal judge ruled against the SEC’s claim that XRP is a security. Exodus Donates $1.3M To Crypto Advocacy Group To Aid Election Day Vote Efforts According to Bitnomial’s lawsuit, the SEC contacted the exchange shortly after the filing, claiming that XRP Futures are \"security futures\" that are subject to joint SEC and CFTC jurisdiction, and that Bitnomial would be violating federal securities laws if it proceeded with the listing. The SEC also said Bitnomial would be required to comply with additional requirements before listing XRP Futures, including registering as a national securities exchange. \"The SEC takes the view that the underlying asset, XRP, is an investment contract and, therefore, transactions in XRP constitute a security under the Securities Exchange Act,\" the lawsuit states. \"Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures.\" Read On The Fox Business App The SEC declined to comment. Tether Looks To Revamp Us Image As It Celebrates 10 Years The SEC's claim that XRP futures are securities futures is a further escalation in the turf war between the securities regulator and the commodities regulator, which are currently vying for sole jurisdiction over digital assets. The biggest question remains whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities or commodities and, in the absence of a regulatory framework, the status of certain tokens is being decided by the courts. The CFTC currently oversees futures contracts for bitcoin and ether, the only two digital assets the SEC has deemed to be non-securities. In addition to seeking a declaration from a judge that XRP Futures are not securities futures, Bitnomial is asking the court to issue an order that prevents the SEC from claiming authority over XRP Futures and taking any legal action against the exchange related to its product offering.

On Oct. 8, the Financial Times reported that in Guadalajara, Mexico, Foxconn would construct the largest factory focused on producing Nvidia's most advanced artificial-intelligence servers. Foxconn is one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturers and is also a supplier for Apple’s iPhones. 💸 Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's FREE daily newsletter 💸 Foxconn will assemble Nvidia’s GB200, a superchip built on its Blackwell architecture, combining two Blackwell graphics-processing units with a Grace central processing unit. This design enables the GB200 to handle intense AI workloads, like real-time processing of trillion-parameter models. Related: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just told investors what’s next for the AI chipmaker \"We're building the largest GB200 production facility on the planet,\" said Benjamin Ting, Foxconn senior vice president for the cloud enterprise solutions business group, Reuters reported. This move indicates a shift in Nvidia's supply chain away from Asia. With the majority of Nvidia's chip production based in the area, investors are worried about geopolitical risks that could hinder Nvidia’s deliveries and revenue. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, said in September that Nvidia can switch to alternative suppliers as it has enough intellectual property. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is now Nvidia’s biggest supplier. “Maybe the process technology is not as great, maybe we won't be able to get the same level of performance or cost, but we will be able to provide the supply,\" Huang said at Goldman Sachs’s Communacopia + Technology Conference. \"And so I think ... in the event anything were to happen, we should be able to pick up and fab it somewhere else,” On Aug. 28, Nvidia released another solid earnings report. For the quarter ended July 28, the company posted adjusted earnings of 68 cents a share, more than double the figure from the year-earlier figure and beating the analyst consensus of 64 cents. Revenue reached $30 billion, marking a 122% year-over-year increase and surpassing the expected $28.7 billion.

        "body": "The bull market in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) began two years ago and is showing few signs of slowing. Backed by the rise of artificial intelligence euphoria and a surprisingly resilient US economy, the S&P 500 has gained more than 60% in the past two years and is hovering near an all-time high. Wall Street strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance believe the bull can keep running wild. Barring any unexpected shocks, the path higher appears to be clear, with earnings growth expected to keep accelerating and the economy on seemingly solid footing as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. A bull market for the S&P 500 was officially declared in June 2023 when the index rose 20% from its recent bear market low. History says this bull market still has legs. At two years, the bull market is well shy of the average run of 5.5 years. And the total return thus far, about 60%, is a far cry from the average 180% gain, per research from Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick. In the past few weeks, several Wall Street equity strategists have made the case for the benchmark index to rise further into both year-end and into 2025, supported by accelerating earnings for the S&P 500. \"We continue to be surprised by the strength of market gains and decided yet again that something more than an incremental adjustment was warranted,\" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski wrote in a September note when raising his year-end price target for the S&P 500 to a Street high of 6,100 from a previous target of 5,600. On Oct. 4, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target to 6,000 and initiated a 12-month target of 6,300. Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin did note, though, that already high valuations could limit the upside for how far the index can reach in 2025. Strategists who spoke with Yahoo Finance agreed with Kostin that already stretched valuations present a challenge to how much higher stocks can go. Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon noted that dating back to the mid-1960s, the only time valuations have been this stretched on a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio were 2021 and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. \"This would tell you that the bull is much older or somewhat near the end of this life,\" Gordon said. But strategists often warn that a high valuation itself isn't a proper tool for calling the end of a bull market. Stocks can trade at what are considered to be expensive valuations for longer than expected. What that does tell investors is that much of the good news that could push stocks higher might've already been priced in.               ",

        "body": "Boeing has clearly had a turbulent year. From several safety incidents to the Starliner fiasco to bringing in a new CEO amid a massive workers’ strike, the company has endured blow after blow. And now, it appears the aviation giant is bleeding money. As of Sept. 27, the fallout from 33,000 workers striking accounted for a $1 billion reduction in U.S. GDP, according to economic analysis and modeling company IMPLAN. On Tuesday, Boeing suspended its ongoing negotiations with striking workers, accusing the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) of making unreasonable demands and withdrew its previous offer for a 30% pay increase over four years. As a result, Wells Fargo predicts Boeing will sell between $10 billion and $15 billion in new stock to account for lost earnings, according to an analyst note dated Oct. 9. Boeing previously targeted $10 billion in working cash on its balance sheet, and Wells Fargo estimates cash dropped to roughly $8 billion at the end of the third quarter. Boeing declined a request for comment from Fortune about whether the company would sell new stock. A $10 billion cash raise keeps balances above the $10 billion watermark through 2025, “but leaves little room for any further challenges while we don't think [Boeing] wants to go to equity markets twice,” according to the note. Still, Wells Fargo analysts say this leaves Boeing with about $30 billion to $40 billion in net debt. “This financial strain is compounded by the potential for a credit rating downgrade from agencies like S&P, which have already placed Boeing’s debt on watch,” Jon Morgan, CEO of business consultancy Venture Smarter, told Fortune. “Considering these factors, an equity offering seems a plausible step for Boeing to shore up its finances. The company needs to ensure it has sufficient liquidity to deal with the ongoing labor disputes and maintain its operations.” Considering it took 10 days for the union and Boeing to meet at the negotiating table when talks first fell apart on Sept. 27, Wells Fargo expects there may be “one more shot at getting a deal” before Boeing releases its latest earnings on Oct. 23. “We believe [Boeing] would like to reach a deal before raising further cash through an equity offering,” according to the analyst note. Wells Fargo analysts did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment on the exact timing of when we might expect an equity offering. However, Wells Fargo predicts the strike will likely stretch on for most of October, which could hit Boeing for another $2 billion or so in cash.         ",

The research firm CEO said perfect conditions are aligning for additional gains exceeding 50%. Other notable investors have been looking to buy the dip in Chinese stocks amid continued stimulus efforts. China's stock rally isn't over — and the nation could have the perfect cocktail of ingredients to stage a monster run-up over the next year, according to one Wall Street forecaster. Jeff deGraaf, the CEO of Renaissance Macro Research, says he sees China's benchmark stock index climbing to 6,000 over the next year. That implies a 54% increase from the CSI 300's current levels, thanks to the right mix of conditions in Beijing that should power equities higher, he told Bloomberg on Friday. \"Skepticism, valuation, stimulus, momentum and a trend change,\" deGraaf said of China's investing environment, adding that it was \"one of the best set-ups\" he's seen over his 35-year career. Chinese stocks have been on a roller coaster in recent weeks after Beijing announced its latest monetary stimulus package, which included lowering interest rates and pumping the stock market with $114 billion. The package sparked the steepest rally in Chinese stocks since 2008 before it quickly fizzled, a sign investors were disappointed Beijing didn't announce more stimulus measures. Markets, though, are expecting the nation to announce a fresh fiscal stimulus package at a briefing on Saturday, potentially reviving the bull case for stocks. Most investors expect China to add 2 trillion yuan, or $283 billion, in fiscal stimulus through 2025, according to a Bloomberg poll of market participants. \"We see the policy response as self-preservation, a reaction to the weakness and a potential Mario Draghi-esque 'Do what it takes' moment for China,\" deGraaf said, later urging investors to \"keep stops in place\" when betting on Chinese stocks. Other traders on Wall Street have shown interest in buying the dip in Chinese equities, despite fear that Beijing's economic slowdown could stick around. Investors poured a record $39.1 billion into Chinese stock funds in the week ending October 9, according to EPFR Global data cited by Bank of America in a note. \"We buy any China dips,\" BofA strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note. Stimulus efforts will continue to \"be used aggressively to boost domestic animal spirits and demand,\" he added. Additionally, the Shenzhen Huaan Hexin Private Investment Fund Management Co., a Chinese hedge fund up 800% since 2017, also says it's buying the dip in technology stocks listed in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index has dropped 3% over the last five trading days, but is still up 27% from levels at the start of the year.      ",

BlackRock has pulled in $360 billion of total net inflows so far this year, surpassing the full-year net flows of 2022 and 2023. BlackRock “sets a high bar we expect few peers are likely to beat,” TD Cowen analysts wrote in a note after the earnings release. Shares of BlackRock rose 3.6% to $990 at 10:29 a.m. in New York. The firm pulled in $5.5 billion of total net flows for alternatives, compared with outflows of $4.2 billion a year ago. It reported $170 billion of illiquid alternative assets. That’s set to surge. After the third quarter ended, the firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, in a deal adding $116 billion of private market assets. BlackRock’s long-term investment funds took in $160 billion net flows in the period, a total that topped the $100 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company also had $61 billion in net flows to cash-management and money-market funds in the period. Operating income rose 26% from a year ago to $2.1 billion. The firm added $2.4 trillion to its total assets over the past 12 months. BlackRock is positioning itself as a single place for global clients to invest across public and private markets. It benefited this year from the surge in stocks and cash beginning to flow into fixed-income and private funds. The S&P 500 Index rose about 5.5% in the third quarter, and investors are betting the Federal Reserve won’t need to cut rates aggressively in the near-term to avoid a recession. BlackRock is in the process of closing a £2.55 billion ($3.3 billion) acquisition of private-markets data firm Preqin. The firm is also signaling that it wants to catch up in the fast-growing market for private credit, recently shaking up the senior executive team of its global private debt business and establishing a direct-lending group. BlackRock is exploring a purchase of HPS Investment Partners that could value the private credit firm in excess of $10 billion, Bloomberg reported this week.           ",

Recommended Reading Nespresso celebrates aluminum in environmental-forward campaign NEW YORK — Environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs are at an inflection point as brands come under pressure from activists to keep out of increasingly politicized areas. Nespresso USA, the Nestlé-owned coffee machine marketer, has stayed the course on making sustainability a core part of its positioning despite the brewing backlash. Last year, the company promoted brand and communications director Jessica Padula to the dual role of vice president of marketing and head of sustainability, a job with duties that can sometimes seem at odds. “You want to force everything into a marketing campaign when, in fact, it really shouldn’t be. Part of my job is actually saying yes or no,” said Padula. “There are things we’re going to communicate and there are some that we’re just going to do and we don’t need to get credit for it right now.” Nespresso, which has not been immune to criticisms over its use of disposable coffee pods, is placing renewed focus on materials in its marketing. A campaign launched during Climate Week NYC in September spotlights Nespresso’s decades-long history of using aluminum packaging, a material that is easier to recycle than plastic but can be energy intensive to produce. The company on Thursday also announced a partnership with Vital Proteins, another B Corp-certified brand, to launch a wellness pack that is being promoted with fitness expert Rad Lopez and Drew Barrymore, who will feature the product on her talk show. Marketing Dive sat down with Padula during Advertising Week New York, at Nespresso’s New York headquarters, to dig deeper on fostering loyalty and navigating the complexity of sustainability in 2024. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. JESSICA PADULA: The topic was about building a brand customers love, which for Nespresso is near and dear to our hearts. I was on a panel with Samsung and Snapchat, well-known consumer-facing brands. I think Nespresso and maybe coffee, as a category, is particularly unique because it’s an everyday consumption moment. If we’re doing it right, we’re being a part of every single day, which is maybe likened to your phone and unlike many other CPG or even FMCG categories. The other piece of Female Quotient that’s really important to us is they’re focused on empowerment and equity. That’s something that, as a purpose-driven brand, we want to over-index in and talk from that lens — not just about our case studies as a business. Consumers don’t always know [about that] and I think that’s a bit of a harder story for us to tell. I’ve been at Nespresso almost nine years, but it has changed significantly. One of the things that’s true — and this actually came up on the panel yesterday — is we’ve always been a direct-to-consumer brand and we’ve always done it in a way that’s high touch, similar to a luxury brand, even though we sell a commodity product. In the past five to 10 years, the capabilities you have with digital, CRM and sophisticated personalization continue to deliver on that luxury expectation. As a DTC brand, we have the benefit of having so much consumer data about what they’re buying, sometimes what they’re consuming if they have a Bluetooth-connected machine, we’re able to start to talk to them as real human beings, not just as a number in our database. We’ve never really sold through third-party retail and trade where there’s this intermediary between you and your end consumer. We’ve always had that one-to-one [relationship], which fundamentally changes our approach to business. It’s funny because it happened at Climate Week and at Adweek’s Brandweek, the same exact conversation around DEI and ESG and how it integrates with marketing strategy. My role continues to be pretty unique in that I lead both marketing and sustainability for the brand. When we talk about sustainability, it’s not like something we just did in the past five years. It’s fundamentally 30 years in the making. We’re working with not just ourselves to try to be sustainable, but a ton of nonprofit partners and NGOs who know how to do things better than we do. We are not farmers, but we need to support farms to make sure that we protect the land and can continue to grow and sell coffee in the future. They go so hand-in-hand, it’s not altruistic. That [backlash] trend doesn’t surprise me because I think there was a wave, post-pandemic, for brands to focus a lot on ESG and DEI, and in some cases that was not authentic to the roots of the company. If you’re able to tell the authentic story, then consumers are looking for values alignment. [Sustainability] doesn't have to be your top-level campaign. [Consumers] have to see that you act that way, and that’s in everything you do beyond marketing campaigns, which is why I think my role connecting the dots between the two can be tricky. I like to say that everything I learned about sustainability, I learned on the job at Nespresso. We’re a B Corp-certified company. That isn’t because we aspired to become B Corp-certified, but rather the actions we’ve taken for 30 years. Sustainability was set up for so long as doing less bad in the world as a business: Offset your emissions and do less harm. Marketing can tell the story of how you move from less bad to more good. The other thing is that a lot of sustainability leaders are not marketers. Many of the things I sat in on during Climate Week were very complex, difficult and technical topics. Because I don’t have a school education in those things, I’ve often had to say: Pause, break it down for me, help me understand. In many ways then, I’m actually like a consumer, because consumers don’t always understand the depth of that unless they’re a very niche audience. As a marketer, I’ve had to challenge myself. Once you get to a certain level in your marketing career, you’re like, “I know how to do this, I just have to stay on top of new technologies and I’m good.” Sustainability has made me stop and have to learn things from the ground up again, but then apply my marketing skills to be able to translate complex topics into something that’s digestible. Anything about Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. It’s funny to think that we expect consumers to understand these things in some ways. I really commend a brand like Allbirds that printed the CO2 emissions on the inside of the shoe. They’re not just trying to get credit for that, they’re trying to teach their consumers. My role is also really focused on the end of life of capsules and machines. I have had to learn so much about how recycling companies make money in the U.S., because we’re trying to motivate the recyclers to accept our capsules into their system so that you can recycle curbside. You can do that in New York. That took an investment with, not just the city of New York — DSNY [NYC Dept. of Sanitation] helped us — but a third-party company that does the recycling for New York City. We have to understand how they make money and what materials are more valuable for them in order to understand where aluminum and coffee grounds might fit into their business model. Maybe I’m silly, but I never thought of recycling as a business. I thought of it as a public service as a consumer. I’ve learned a ton of really technical [information] about how glass, plastic and metal get recycled, how they commingle, what that looks like, and then the business side of waste, which is not something you learn as a marketer but is a whole industry unto itself. It hasn’t changed as much as it’s opened new lines of communication. A good example is our Relove refurbished machine program. We are always looking at the next exciting machine innovation that’s coming out, but one of the questions that may not get asked if you’re purely a marketing or a salesperson on the commercial side is: If someone wants to upgrade their machine, what happens to their old machine? My role has made me connect those dots. I might want to sell [consumers] a new machine and upgrade them, but I also have to think about the end of life of their current machine. Are we serving the customer and are we serving the planet at the end of the day in this consumerism world that we live in? ",

Following a rally to all-time highs, the S&P 500 took a breather. While Thursday’s economic figures were not perceived by Wall Street as catastrophic, they certainly highlighted the Fed’s challenge of bringing inflation back to the 2% target without cooling the jobs market too much. And that has added to the debate about the Fed’s next steps. For now, bond traders continued to bet the central bank will reduce the pace of cuts to 25 basis points in November. Three Fed policymakers — John Williams, Austan Goolsbee and Thomas Barkin were unfazed by a higher-than-forecast consumer price index, suggesting officials can continue lowering rates. The outlier was Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal he revealed that, in projections released in September, he had called for one additional quarter-point cut this year. The Fed has two remaining meetings in 2024. “One slightly hotter-than-expected CPI reading doesn’t mean a new wave of inflation has been unleashed, but the fact that it accompanied a jump in weekly jobless claims may add to short-term market uncertainty,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “These weren’t good numbers — but that doesn’t mean they upended the larger outlook for solid economic growth and moderate inflation.” In a note titled “The Fed’s quandary as inflation warmer while labor cooler,” Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial says the latest economic numbers were not the combination the Fed wants to see. “If inflation data continues to indicate that prices are generally rising amid a backdrop of a cooler labor market, the Fed’s next meeting will undoubtedly involve a more heated discussion of which of the Fed’s mandates takes precedence,” she noted.

But the rise in stocks puts major indexes at lofty valuations, leaving long-term investors wondering how they should proceed from here. Bankrate’s Third-Quarter Market Mavens Survey asked market professionals what, if anything, long-term investors should do with their portfolios as stocks trade near all-time highs. Here’s what they had to say. This article is one in a series discussing the results of Bankrate’s Third-Quarter 2024 Market Mavens Survey: Survey: Market strategists see 10-year Treasury yield at 3.5% a year from now Best moves for long-term investors with stocks near all-time highs, according to market experts Stock market outlook for the next 12 months: Here’s what top analysts are predicting into 2025 With stocks near all-time highs, there’s a good chance that there have been some shifts in investors’ portfolio allocations over the past few years. The investment pros surveyed by Bankrate think now is a good time to review those allocations. “If investors only do one thing, they should rebalance portfolios back to their targeted allocations,” says Chris Fasciano, senior portfolio manager at Commonwealth Financial Network. Wells Fargo Investment Institute Senior Global Market Strategist Sameer Samana also says now is a good time to review your overall portfolio. “Update your financial plan, and rebalance in-line with the plan’s recommended allocations,” he says. Portfolio rebalancing and diversification go hand in hand. A key reason for portfolio rebalancing is to make sure your portfolio stays diversified and doesn’t have too much or too little exposure to any one asset class. “For long-term investors, holding well-diversified portfolios, or broad market indices, is generally a winning strategy,” says Dec Mullarkey, managing director at SLC Management. “While markets can seem over valued at different points, some companies will deliver the expected strong growth while others fail but leave market share for new competitors,” Mullarkey says. “So, sticking with well-diversified portfolios and periodically rebalancing to your long-term asset mix targets, tends to be a reliable formula to capture stable long-term performance.” With stocks at highs, some of the experts surveyed expressed a more cautious tone and suggested investors pay close attention to any holdings that may be particularly risky.

For 2025, Barclays estimates market forecasts include expectations of 110 basis points in Medicare margin expansion, which is on the lower end of CVS’s target range of 100-200 bps. Barclays has upgraded CVS from Equal Weight to Overweight, with a price target of $82, up from $63. By 2026, projections show about 90 bps of margin improvement. Collectively, this suggests a cumulative recovery of 200 bps over two years, placing consensus Medicare margins at approximately -2.0%, which may underestimate the speed of CVS’s recovery. CVS is well-positioned to continue gaining market share in the retail pharmacy space, a trend that Barclays estimates could accelerate in 2025 as Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) moves forward with plans to close over 1,000 of the roughly 2,000 unprofitable stores identified for closure. While the full impact of Walgreens’ store closures will depend on the timing—spread over the next three years—the analyst expects a significant number to close within the first year due to their unprofitability. CVS has consistently increased its pharmacy market share since the first quarter of 2020, holding 27.2% as of the first quarter of 2024. Barclays estimates CVS has been gaining approximately 5-10 bps of market share each quarter, with cumulative gains likely exceeding 150 bps since before the pandemic.

        "body": "Meta Platforms has announced the expansion of its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, Meta AI, to 21 new markets, including the UK and Brazil. The expansion to new markets is part of the company’s plan to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms said that it aims to make its AI chatbot more accessible by supporting multiple languages and attracting a global user base. With nearly 500 million monthly active users, Meta AI will begin its rollout in Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, Paraguay, the Philippines, and the UK, with added support for Tagalog. Subsequently, the expansion will continue into countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Malaysia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Thailand, Tunisia, the UAE, Vietnam, and Yemen, incorporating languages like Arabic, Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese. Following the phased introduction, Meta AI is expected to be available in 43 countries and support a dozen languages. However, the latest expansion will not include the new character voices for the AI chatbot that company CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed at the company's annual Connect conference. These features are set to be released on a different schedule, according to the company. Additionally, Meta AI will soon be accessible on Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the UK and Australia, further extending the platform's reach and capabilities. The latest development comes after Meta Platforms introduced Movie Gen, an AI video generator capable of creating or editing videos from simple text prompts. This tool, which can generate videos up to 16 seconds long, is said to position Meta in direct competition with OpenAI and Google, as the race to develop advanced AI technologies intensifies. \"Meta AI chatbot expands to 21 additional markets\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.

The ads, which include TV, online and print, focus on domestic travelers, Airbnb Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson told Skift. (See two of the ads below.) “Historically, Airbnb has been much more about travelers from abroad coming into Japan, or Japanese travelers, maybe traveling abroad to the U.S. or France, or other places,” Stephenson said. “This is about Japanese travelers, traveling in Japan, which is the significant majority of the travel market in Japan.” Stephenson said Airbnb’s growth in Japan would take “many years.” “It takes time, it takes persistence,” he added. Airbnb sees international expansion as an important opportunity. In addition to Japan, Airbnb is targeting Mexico, China, and Brazil, among other markets. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky spoke about the challenges of breaking into some global markets on the company’s second-quarter earnings call. “So like in Korea and Japan, they prefer to do browsing than search. So we’ve had to retool our product. And that’s yielded some huge conversion rate increases.” And he noted the opportunity in Japan, in particular: “Japan is going to be a longer game, but that’s one of the biggest travel markets in the world.” Here are the two Japan ads, which deal with the variety of accommodation options, including seaside properties, available on Airbnb, and their suitability for families: Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.

Berkshire sold 9.5 million shares over three days at an average price of around $40. Buffett began shedding Bank of America stock in mid-July.  Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) won't have to report its transactions in Bank of America (BAC) stock promptly anymore. That's because Buffett continued his recent selloff of Berkshire's holdings in the bank, and no longer has a 10% stake, the level required to give timely updates on investments. In a securities filing, Berkshire said it had sold about 9.5 million shares of BofA over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at an average price of approximately $40, netting some $380 million. Following the sale, Berkshire owns 775 million BofA shares. Berkshire began dumping the bank's stock in mid-July, and last month shed another 5.8 million shares. Asked about that then, BofA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Moynihan called Buffett \"a great shareholder,\" and explained that he didn't know why Buffett was selling, but wasn't worried. \"Life will go on,\" he added. The news didn't hurt Bank of America shares, which rose 5% Friday morning along with other bank stocks, and are up about 25% year-to-date. TradingView Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "WeightWatchers (WW) is trying to save its ailing business by betting on a market that threatens its very existence. The weight-loss company, previously championed by the likes of Oprah Winfrey, saw its stock spike this week after announcing that it will make copycats of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs. WW International (i.e. WeightWatchers) stock jumped nearly 40% Wednesday following the news, and the stock climbed an additional 23% Thursday to close at $1.96. WW is up 172% from last week. Though WeightWatchers’ core business is its dieting program, the company has attempted to get in on the booming weight-loss drug market dominated by pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). (The strategy was championed by its former CEO Sima Sistani, who recently departed the company.) WeightWatchers first attempted to secure a foothold in the weighty drug space early last year with its acquisition of Sequence, a telehealth platform specializing in weight-loss medication management. The acquisition has failed to improve the company’s revenue, which fell 14.5% in 2023 and is expected to decline another 13% this year. WeightWatchers’ announcement Tuesday that it will offer compounded GLP-1 drugs — which are cheaper and don't require insurance — is another shot at capitalizing on the market late in the game. Federal laws allow companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration’s shortage list. Regulations allow the drugs to be made at FDA-registered facilities, but the compounded medications themselves are not FDA-approved. WeightWatchers will offer a compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Here's the rub: Once the Novo Nordisk drugs are removed from the FDA’s shortage list, WeightWatchers will no longer be able to produce compounded semaglutide drugs at scale. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound, was removed from the list last week, posing a massive problem for companies making compounded versions of the drug. “Compounding is not a sustainable long-term business model,” Barclays (BARC.L) healthcare technology and distribution analyst Stephanie Davis told Yahoo Finance. Davis is one of four Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg. Half of those analysts have Equal Weight ratings on WW, and Davis is one of the other two analysts who recommend selling the stock. Meanwhile, WeightWatchers’ expansion in the weight-loss drug space contradicts its core business. “GLP-1s are going to cannibalize the diet industry,” Davis said.            ",

        "body": "By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Thursday as investors looked to higher-than-expected inflation and unemployment claims for indications on the health of the U.S. economy and the path for interest rates. The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% on a monthly basis in September and 2.4% on an annual basis, with both figures being slightly higher than estimated by economists polled by Reuters. The core figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.3% year-over-year, versus an estimate of 3.2%. In a separate report released on Thursday, jobless claims also rose to 258,000 for the week ending Oct. 5, versus an estimate of 230,000. \"Investors were torn between a stronger than expected CPI report and a weaker than expected unemployment claims report,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital in Chicago. \"One showed inflation running hotter than expected and the other showed the economy looking weaker than expected. It's the worst of both worlds.\" After the economic data, traders were pricing in a roughly 80% probability that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in November and a roughly 20% chance it would leave rates unchanged, according to CME's FedWatch. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic on Thursday said he would be \"totally comfortable\" skipping an interest-rate cut at an upcoming meeting of the U.S. central bank, adding that the \"choppiness\" in recent data on inflation and employment may warrant leaving rates on hold in November. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he sees \"gradual\" rate cuts over the next year-and-a-half, while the New York Fed's John Williams said he still sees rate reductions ahead. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 57.88 points, or 0.14%, to 42,454.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.99 points, or 0.21%, to 5,780.05 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 9.57 points, or 0.05%, to 18,282.05. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow had notched record closing highs in the previous day's session. Only three of the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors advanced on Thursday with energy, adding 0.8% and outperforming the rest as oil prices rose. [O/R] Oil futures rallied as U.S. fuel use spiked ahead of Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on Florida's west coast late on Wednesday. Oil prices are also being supported by supply concerns related to conflicts in the Middle East.

Last week saw the highest weekly sales for digital collectibles since August, according to new data from NFT market tracker CryptoSlam. The organization said that weekly sales rose to $82.6 million in the past seven days, a major jump for NFT sales volumes. However, the data has limitations. Weekly reports on NFTs offer only a short timeframe of information and do not take into account seasonal factors that may influence sales. Given the high volatility in NFT markets, these reports are unlikely to reflect the long-term health of the market as a whole. Despite this, however, NFTs continue to draw eye-watering sums. Earlier this month, a user sold a CryptoPunk NFT for $56.3 million. Earlier this year, CryptoSlam reported a major plunge in NFT sales volumes, reporting a 45% decrease in NFT sales during the second quarter of the year. More recent data shows that August recorded the year's lowest NFT sales volumes, coming in at just $376.3 million, making the summer month the worst month of the year for sales. While the current upsurge in NFT sales pales in comparison to the volume recorded during the crypto market’s 2021-2022 bull run, some are speculating that NFTs are due for a resurgence. More than $26.5 million in NFT sales were recorded on the Ethereum blockchain network recently, and this week alone has seen over $5.5 million in sales, a figure that might only grow. ",

The idea presumably is to provide ballast for her funds, which consist mostly of riskier stocks. Sometimes she’ll even buy when the stocks are rising, and that’s what she did Tuesday. Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter Investors and analysts are split in their views of Wood, possibly the country’s best-known investor after Warren Buffett. Boosters view her as a technology genius, while critics contend she’s just a mediocre money manager. Wood (Mama Cathie to her acolytes) soared to fame after a whopping return of 153% in 2020 and clear explanations of her investment strategy in frequent media appearances. Marco Bello/Getty Images But her longer-term performance won’t make you forget Buffett. Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $5.5 billion in assets, produced annualized returns of 15% for the past 12 months, negative 25% for the past three years and positive 3% for five years. That pales in comparison to the S&P 500. The index posted positive annualized returns of 35% for one year, 11% for three years, and 16% for five years. Wood’s investment philosophy is simple. Ark ETFs usually purchase emerging-company stocks in the high-tech categories of artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. Wood says companies in those categories are game changers. Of course, these stocks are often volatile, so Ark funds’ values can oscillate sharply. Renowned investment research firm Morningstar has launched strong criticism of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. Related: Cathie Wood sells two rocking tech stocks The potential of Wood’s five high-tech platforms listed above is “compelling,” Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold wrote in a commentary. “But the firm’s ability to spot winners and manage their myriad risks is less so. ... It has not proved it is worth the risks it takes.” Morningstar portfolio strategist Amy Arnott calculated that Ark Innovation destroyed $7.1 billion of shareholder wealth from its 2014 inception through 2023. That put the ETF No. 3 on her wealth destruction list for mutual funds and ETFs over the past decade. Fraser Perring, a short-seller who founded Viceroy Research, unleashed a harsh assessment of Wood in 2022. “I wouldn’t even put your money with Cathie Wood,” he told New York magazine. “She is part of the problem. ... She’s a capital depleter. With the amount of capital she’s evaporated, how can people even suggest she’s successful? She’s successful at failing.”                  ",

Markets were aided by Beijing’s announcement that its finance minister will give another stimulus briefing on Saturday, at which investors expect more measures to boost the economy. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise as producer prices rise more than expected The Nikkei 225 hovered near breakeven, posting a minimal 0.26% rise with the financial sector leading the way, as traders awaited the release of U.S. before the bell in New York.

Investors awaited the pre-market release of September CPI inflation numbers, which will have implications for the Fed's plans to cut interest rates—or not—in November. On Wednesday, cruise lines saw their shares surge as oil prices dropped, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings leading the pack with a 10.91% gain.

But some important industries are still feeling the aftershocks of the pandemic – despite undoubted recoveries. The cruise industry is one of these. While the overall hospitality and leisure sector is definitely enjoying better times, the world’s major cruise companies are showing idiosyncratic reactions as the vacation market normalizes – although it remains to be seen how the industry will absorb the shock of the recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the cruise lines are showing recent gains in earnings and revenues, and some are also showing powerful stock gains, while some are dealing with debt fallout from the pandemic. Assessing the current state of the industry, Citi analyst James Hardiman thinks the sector presents solid opportunities. “Our web traffic analysis points to September cruise traffic being among the best on record,” Hardiman recently noted. “Whereas Street narratives/multiplies see strong recent performance as a ‘catch-up trade’, our analysis and data suggest this growth has real legs into ‘25 and beyond.” Looking toward that long-term horizon, we’ve used the TipRanks Smart Score tool to locate two top-scoring cruise stocks – stocks that Hardiman feels deserve some closer investor attention. The Smart Score gathers and collates the voluminous market data on every stock, and uses it to rate the share in comparison to a set of factors that are known to predict outperformance. Both of these cruise stocks – Hardiman’s picks for the coming year – have also earned the Smart Score’s ‘Perfect 10’ rating. Let’s give them a closer look and find out exactly why the analyst and the AI algorithm agree that these are compelling buys. Carnival Corporation (CCL) First up, Carnival Cruise Corporation, a giant of the modern cruise industry with a 50-plus year history in the business. The company boasts a market cap of more than $25.5 billion, making it the second-largest cruise company plying the seas today. Carnival operates through its various brands, which include such famous cruise-industry names as Princess, Holland-America, and Cunard. Through these brands, Carnival Corporation sails a fleet of 95 modern cruise ships. Carnival’s brands are well-known, and respected for their modern equipment. The company is also known for its distinctive liveries – Carnival’s eponymous brand sails ships with funnels painted in a red-and-blue scheme, and shaped like a whale’s tale fluke, while Cunard, operating the famous liners Queen Mary 2 and Queen Elizabeth, is known for its black hulls and white superstructures.

        "body": "Tempest Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:TPST) stock is trading higher on Thursday, with a strong session volume of over 23 million as per data from Benzinga Pro. The company entered into an agreement with Roche Holdings AG (OTC:RHHBY) to advance the evaluation of amezalpat (TPST-1120) in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and bevacizumab, the current standard of care for unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), into a Phase 3 trial for the first-line treatment of liver cancer. Under the agreement, Roche will supply atezolizumab globally and Tempest will sponsor and lead the pivotal study. This agreement builds on a clinical collaboration between the companies under which amezalpat was combined with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line HCC patients and compared to atezolizumab and bevacizumab alone in a randomized Phase 1b/2 study. Tempest retains all development and commercial rights to amezalpat. “Based on the positive Phase 2 data, I believe this combination therapy holds the potential to significantly improve first-line liver cancer treatment, and we look forward to amezalpat moving into this pivotal Phase 3 study,” said Stephen Brady, president and CEO of Tempest. In June, Tempest reported updated survival data from the ongoing global randomized Phase 1b/2 study, demonstrating a six-month improvement in median overall survival (OS) for patients receiving the combination therapy compared to the control arm of atezolizumab and bevacizumab alone. The survival benefit observed in the amezalpat arm was also maintained in key subpopulations. These June data build upon previously released data from the primary analysis showing that the amezalpat combination therapy provided clinical benefit regardless of PD-L1 status and in patients with both immune excluded and immune desert tumors. Patients with a mutation in the beta-catenin gene had an increased objective response rate, and a longer median OS was observed in the updated data set. Both were supported by amezalpat’s purported mechanism of action. The company is preparing for the Phase 3 study to start in the first quarter of 2025.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation The National Transmission Company South Africa, a state-owned business that will operate separately from parent Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., said this week it plans to spend 112 billion rand ($6.4 billion) on transmission capacity over the next five years. The NTCSA — which started up on Monday — said it’s considering building infrastructure itself or paying for developers to construct transmission lines and then taking them over, as well as “independent transmission projects” that may involve issuing concessions to private companies. While it hasn’t decided on funding models, at least some of the money would have to come from capital markets, according to Rand Merchant Bank. “Transmission infrastructure is capital-intensive and requires long-term funding,” Kate Rushton, a credit analyst at RMB, wrote in a report. “The debt market, including traditional providers such as banks, and the bond market will be important sources of debt financing.” A flood of new issuance for transmission lines and other infrastructure spending by state-owned companies may help revive the corporate bond market, where new issuance remains below the record levels seen before Covid-19 plunged the economy into contraction. Bond sales by companies reached 169 billion rand in 2019, before slumping in 2020. Issuance this year is at 116 billion rand, according to data compiled by Rand Merchant Bank, which expects borrowing to reach 131 billion rand by year-end. State-owned companies contributed just 15 billion rand. “There’s definitely scope for capital-raising in that market,” said Valdene Reddy, director of capital markets at JSE Ltd., which operates the country’s stock and bond markets. “The transmission company will be a good exercise, but there’s still a big piece of work in terms of restructuring that balance sheet. Getting that pipeline ready, even if it’s not a short-term initiative, but a medium-term initiative for listing equity or debt, will be quite healthy.” In an Oct. 9 review, Moody’s Ratings said Eskom would have to raise debt to finance network investments, but its ability to access markets on commercial terms — without new government guarantees — would depend on “significant improvement in its operations, debt collection, governance and regulatory arrangements.”                 ",

        "body": "BofA Securities has upgraded Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), an energy infrastructure company that owns and controls oil and gas pipelines and terminals. The analyst notes stabilized base business. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter 2024 earnings on 16 October, with analysts estimating $0.27 for adjusted EPS and $3.95 billion for revenues. Amid uncertainty in the energy sector, the analyst recognizes the potential in companies with contracted natural gas pipelines. With increasing demand driven by Gulf Coast LNG projects and the electrification of utilities through AI, Kinder Morgan is positioned for long-term growth through its contracted business model. The strength of its natural gas pipeline business, which commands a higher valuation, balances out the declines seen in lower-valued CO and product pipelines. The analyst has upgraded from Neutral to Buy rating with a price target of $27, up from $23. Kinder Morgan has demonstrated its ability to supply gas to utilities, similar to Williams Companies Inc (NYSE:WMB), exemplified by the recent sanctioning of a $3 billion, 1.2 Bcf/d SNG pipeline expansion last quarter.

BofA writes that the core business is now robust. Concerns that previously caused hesitation have been resolved, including the Supreme Court halted the Good Neighbor plan, which could have cost Kinder Morgan billions, the Double H pipeline, which represents the only significant contract roll of approximately $30 million in 2024, is transitioning to NGL service, effectively compensating for the prior contract, and recent acreage exchanges are revitalizing oil declines. Kinder Morgan currently accounts for 45% of LNG deliveries, and the analyst anticipates it will retain this market share. More importantly, the rise in power demand driven by electrification and AI is expected to contribute an additional conservative estimate of 4-5 Bcf/d of gas demand by 2030, particularly in regions served by Kinder Morgan pipelines.

This follows five consecutive months of decline, reflecting weak economic growth as domestic consumption continued to be held back by the ongoing property crisis in the country. Overall GDP growth slowed to 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024 from 5.3% in the first quarter. Retail sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), comprising electric mainly plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, jumped by 51% year-on-year to 1.12 million units in September, driven by stimulus measures introduced this year by the Chinese government. At the end of July the government doubled the one-off subsidy it introduced in April to CNY20,000 (US$2,800) for buyers trading in their old internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for qualifying new battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The government had previously also taken measures to push the struggling banking sector to reduce downpayment requirements on vehicle loans. In the first eight months of 2024 domestic retail sales of passenger vehicles increased by 2% to 15.5 million units, with NEV sales rising by 37% to 7.13 million units. \"China car market ticks up in September\" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "body": "A big jump in retail spending would be the next data point indicating a \"no landing\" of the economy. BofA analysts expect retail sales last month to soar 0.8%, above forecasts of 0.2%. A no-landing scenario occurs when strong economic growth fuels inflation and hinders rate cuts. America's spending habits are the next data point to monitor as Wall Street investors see rising odds of a \"no landing\" scenario for the US economy. Bank of America analysts expect September retail sales data, set for release on October 17, to show a 0.8% surge. Consensus estimates expect just 0.2% growth, according to economists polled by Bloomberg. The analysts say such a large jump in retail spending would likely increase the odds of a no-landing. That's a situation in which continued economic growth adds fuel to inflation and prevents the Federal Reserve from quickly cutting interest rates. While such an outcome points to a strong economy, it also could be bad news for people waiting for relief from higher borrowing costs. The analysts say that while monthly retail data can fluctuate, a big increase last month would be cause for concern. \"Monthly retail sales data can be volatile. But a report like the one we are forecasting would be significant,\" the analysts said in a Thursday note. They suggest that a strong report on the heels of \"very encouraging\" GDP and GDI revisions and a \"gangbusters\" September jobs report would only extend the slew of recent upside surprises that point to a hot economy. \"A month ago, the question was whether we are headed for a recession or a soft landing. If retail sales accelerate considerably, in our view, the narrative may shift further toward 'no landing' or even re-acceleration,\" they said. If the Fed has to pause its easing cycle amid high inflation, Americans will be left with higher prices and steeper borrowing costs. The analysts' outlook comes after last week's blockbuster September jobs report ignited speculation of a no-landing scenario. The report showed that the economy added 254,000 jobs in September, far above analyst estimates. Economic and income growth has also proved strong, with a set of revisions last month showing GDP grew faster than initially thought in the second quarter. The consumer price index, meanwhile, came in slightly higher than estimates on Thursday. The analysts acknowledge that last month's retail data might not be enough to force the Fed to stop its easing cycle, \"at least, not yet.\" They say the Fed will likely cut two to four more times even if the labor and economic activity remain strong.

A day after a California judge ruled the company has to open Android to third-party app stores, the Justice Department, in another case, said it may propose that the tech giant sell off a part of its business, like the Chrome browser or Android, to break up its search dominance. And how did Wall Street react to a potentially seismic event that could forever reshape the tech landscape? With a shrug — Google shares sank less than 2% Wednesday after the DOJ’s breakup recommendation. Part of the muted reaction has to do with the sluggish pace of legal proceedings. Even if judges rule against Google in every subsequent decision, the ultimate adverse outcome is still years away. But Wall Street also wagers that such a drastic decision would be so difficult to implement and so destructive in its consequences that a more modest remedy is likelier. Like separating conjoined twins, cutting off Google’s intertwined businesses poses immense challenges, and it almost seems hard to believe. And many still don't. “The street is looking at this and thinking despite all the scary headlines and noise that the chances of a breakup are minimal,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Investors are largely looking past Google’s legal troubles, cleaving instead to Mountain View’s vision for growth, powered by its cloud business, AI initiatives, and advertising empire. In a 32-page proposal, lawyers for the Justice Department outlined a framework of options for how the court should dismantle Google’s monopoly power in search. The potential remedies spanned from the harshest — breaking the company apart — to more limited plans, such as forcing Google into a data-sharing arrangement with rival search providers. But even as the most severe remedy is on the table, investors are still waiting for more guidance before making any big moves. In that reading, what may initially seem like denial reads pragmatic. “We think Google’s valuation at the moment largely discounts most of the associated regulatory risks but the market is looking for greater clarity on pending issues before bidding the stock in one direction over another,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Google’s year-to-date stock performance has lagged behind most of its Magnificent Seven peers, sitting in fifth place up about 15% and trailing the broader market’s gains of about 21%. So it may be that Wall Street has already priced in the regulatory risks. What’s more, an outcome that mandates Google change its business practices, rather than divest, could push the stock higher if investors see the ruling as a merciful punishment.         ",

This was the largest single-day jump of the past two years. What are the takeaways for transportation providers and managers in the wake of the third major transportation market disruption to hit in less than a month? Hurricanes can be the catalysts for dramatic shifts in North American transportation markets, traditionally making sourcing truckload capacity much more challenging. Shipping activity stalls for days, infrastructure like roads and warehouses are damaged, and then comes the disaster relief draw for carriers. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was the primary catalyst for one of the longest stretches of trucking market tightening of the past 20 years outside of COVID. In the days leading into a hurricane, carriers avoid driving into danger — as they should. Shippers may send out increased orders as they try to move their goods out of harm’s way. Inbound tender rejection rates for the Lakeland market in central Florida spiked to over 15%, the highest value since the pandemic era ended in early 2022. Outbound tender volumes also increased ahead of the storm, before dropping quickly as it made landfall. This type of activity creates bottlenecks in transportation shipping for a period of time after the storm passes. The national freight market has been a well-oiled machine since early 2022, as there has been more than enough trucking capacity to fill in the gaps when disruptions have occurred. Milton is the third major disruption to hit national transportation networks over the past three weeks. Hurricane Helene landed in the Big Bend area of the Florida Gulf Coast on Sept. 26 as a major Category 4 storm. The bulk of the damage occurred inland as the system quickly tracked into north Georgia and the western Carolinas. The storm caused catastrophic damage to the area but was not a major immediate disruption to transportation due to the lack of a major outbound shipping presence being impacted. The following week, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) went on strike for three days, resulting in several days of lost container clearing and shipping activity around the East Coast ports. While many shippers were prepared for this, some slight deterioration was detected in the form of slightly increasing rejection and spot rates.                ",

        "body": "By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer prices rose slightly more than expected in September amid higher food costs, but the annual increase in inflation was the smallest in more than 3-1/2 years, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates again next month. Other data from the Labor Department on Thursday showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged last week to the highest level in more than a year, driven by Hurricane Helene and a nearly month-old strike at Boeing. The strike and hurricanes could cloud the labor market picture through the end of the year. Despite the firmer-than-expected monthly inflation reading, a sharp moderation in rent increases led economists to expect a more muted rise in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price indexes, the inflation measures tracked by the U.S. central bank for its 2% target. \"Consumers might fixate on the firmness of inflation in categories like food, while the Fed might welcome the softer shelter reading finally starting to come through,\" said Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. \"Either way, inflation has been normalizing. As such, the evolution of the Fed's approach feels prudent.\" The consumer price index increased 0.2% last month after gaining 0.2% in August, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Food prices jumped 0.4% after rising 0.1% in August. Grocery store food prices increased 0.4%, lifted by higher costs for meat, poultry, fish and eggs. Fruits and vegetable prices rebounded 0.9% after dropping 0.2% in August. But consumers got some relief from gasoline prices, which plunged 4.1%. Rents increased 0.3% after climbing 0.4% in the prior month. In the 12 months through September, the CPI rose 2.4%. That was the smallest year-on-year increase since February 2021 and followed a 2.5% advance in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1% and rising 2.3% year-on-year. The annual increase in inflation has slowed from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Inflation is a major issue for voters in next month's presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's nominee, is locked in a tight race with the Republican Party's candidate Donald Trump. The Fed has mostly shifted focus to the labor market, delivering an unusually large 50 basis points rate cut in September. Minutes of that meeting published on Wednesday showed a \"substantial majority\" of policymakers supported starting an era of easier monetary policy with an outsized cut, but there appeared even broader agreement that the initial move would not commit the Fed to any particular pace of rate reductions in the future.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? New rules speeding up baseball make it more fun for fans, and women’s basketball is seeing a surge in viewers thanks to Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, he said Thursday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference. Boxing, Smith said, is one he would sell. “The promoters have ruined the sport,” Smith said. “They need somebody like (UFC chief) Dana White overseeing the sport. So you can give us the fights we want to see, when we want to see them, as opposed to dudes being able to avoid one another because they might get knocked out.” Golf is a sell, too, despite Tiger Woods’ success in what was historically an all-White sport. “There is nothing about golf that says to me, I’m invited, nothing,” said Smith, who is Black. “It costs a boatload of money to be a member of the club. You got to buy your golf clubs. It’s at a country club that, you know, the only time you really, really see Black folks, they’re working there.” Smith, 56, is one of the best known personalities on ESPN, serving as the featured commentator and executive producer of the weekday morning show First Take and as an analyst on NBA Countdown. He also hosts his own show on ESPN’s radio network. The network, which is owned by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., is suffering like other traditional TV companies as consumers cancel cable-TV subscriptions and shift to streaming services. As a result, ESPN has been in cost-cutting mode in recent years, with several high-profile personalities departing. Last month, one of the network’s highest-paid stars, NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, announced he was retiring. Smith has reportedly been looking for as much as $25 million annually in a new contract, twice what he’s currently making. He said he prefers to stay as ESPN and wants to reach a deal with the network. “And so now a negotiation takes place and hopefully the two sides can come to an accord,” he said. “And if we can’t, we can’t.

        "body": " Shares of Uber and Lyft jumped on Friday after Tesla's introduction to its new robotaxi failed to live up to ridesharing investors' fears. Analysts noted Tesla's much-anticipated event was light on details about the rollout of a ridesharing app that would compete with Uber or Lyft, lifting an uncertainty that has hung over the stocks for months. Uber shares hit an all-time high, while Tesla slumped further into negative territory for the year.  Shares of Uber Technologies (UBER) jumped to a record high on Friday after Tesla’s (TSLA) much-anticipated robotaxi launch event failed to live up to ridesharing investors' fears. Tesla on Thursday evening unveiled its CyberCab, an autonomous car designed for ridesharing, and a 20-seater \"RoboVan.\" CEO Elon Musk said the CyberCab would cost less than $30,000, and described a vision of individuals operating fleets of CyberCabs as an alternative to driving one car through either Uber or Lyft. Analysts were disappointed by the event, noting it was lighter on details than many Uber and Lyft investors had feared. Jefferies analysts in a note to clients called the CyberCab “toothless,” and said the event was a “best-case outcome for Uber.” Tesla, the analysts wrote, didn't \"provide verifiable evidence of progress\" on autonomous vehicles (AV), and that Uber was “uniquely positioned to support sustainable growth for AV developers.” Jefferies has a “buy” rating on Uber stock. Bank of America analysts noted that some risks remain, including the potential for RoboVans and CyberCabs to cost significantly less to operate than a conventional rideshare. However, Tesla gave “no specific business model” for a rideshare app that would compete with Uber or Lyft. They maintained their \"buy\" rating on Uber. Uber stock was up nearly 10% at $85.66, an all-time high, on Friday afternoon. Shares of competitor Lyft (LYFT) also jumped almost 10%.

        "body": "US stocks were lower on Thursday after the latest consumer inflation print came in hotter than anticipated, further blurring the picture of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision in November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped around 0.1%, or just less than 60 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2% after both clinched fresh record highs on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was off less than 0.1%. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more than 1% as it eyed a rise to a record high, while e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) also rose roughly 1%, helping the Nasdaq pare earlier losses. In focus on Thursday was a reading on consumer inflation showing prices rose 0.2% last month, more than the 0.1% rise Wall Street was expecting. On an annualized basis, prices rose 2.4%, compared with 2.3% expected. The data was of greater interest than usual as investors puzzle over the chances of a \"no landing\" for the economy after last week's jobs report revived worries about inflation flaring up again. But the jobs market provided a surprise of its own on Thursday, as initial unemployment claims rose to 258,000, much more than Wall Street anticipated and the highest print since August 2023. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Amid all the moving parts, traders now see a 17% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Just a week ago, the odds of no cut were at 0% as the market heeded policymakers' message and prepared for a 25 basis point rate reduction. Also on deck is Tesla's (TSLA) highly anticipated robotaxi event on Thursday evening. CEO Elon Musk is expected to reveal a two-door, butterfly-wing prototype of the cybercab he has bet the EV maker's future on. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) added as much as 4 basis points on Thursday to hit 4.1% for the first time since late July. The 10-year has now added roughly 30 basis points over the past week as investors have scaled back their expectations for interest rate cuts amid signs that inflation may be stickier than initially thought while economic growth data holds steady. For much of the past few years, higher yields have been a headwind for stocks. But Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance on Thursday yields likely have risen enough to be too much of a headwind just yet. \"I don't think this backup in interest rates is all that worrisome for equities in aggregate,\" Kantrowitz said. \"But where it does show up is in leadership.\" Kantrowitz pointed out that areas like Real Estate (XLRE) and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT), which had benefited from investors anticipating lower rates, have lagged amid the 10-year yields recent rise. For now, Kantrowitz added, rising rates are driving market leadership more than it is weighing on the overall S&P 500 index. \"If rates keep going higher, I don't think it's a massive issue for equities unless it persists for, I'd say, a few months,\" he said. Weekly jobless claims soared to 258,000 in the week ending Oct. 5, the largest weekly gain since August 2023. The move higher from the prior week's reading of 225,000 was the largest week-over-week increase since July 2021. Economists were quick to point out that the ongoing strike from Boeing workers and the several hurricanes that hit different parts of the US over the past several weeks likely impacted the results. \"Claims rose markedly in some of the states most impacted by Hurricane Helene and the Boeing strike although some unimpacted states saw large increases as well,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"Claims will likely continue to be elevated in states affected by Helene, Hurricane Milton and the Boeing strike until its resolved.\" Even with some clear distortion from Hurricane Helene, Citi economist Gisela Hoxha wrote in a note to clients that states that weren't impacted by the hurricane also saw an increase. \"This suggests that the rise in initial claims is not just a temporary weather driven increase but could reflect some genuine economic weakness in other parts of the country,\" Hoxha wrote. On the surface, this would likely boost the case for a November interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which has made it clear it won't welcome further signs of labor market weakness. But Thursday also brought a hotter-than-expected inflation reading, which furthered the case for the Fed not to cut at all in November. Combine both pieces of data and the picture is rather mixed. There is perhaps one clear takeaway, though: Higher claims are likely going to be the norm heading into the Fed's next meeting. This means market participants will continue to debate whether the central bank will be willing to write off the increase as noise from weather-related job displacements or consider it a true sign of labor market deterioration. Tesla stock (TSLA) was nearly flat on Thursday as investors anxiously await the electric vehicle maker's “We, Robot” event, set to take place well after the closing bell on Wall Street. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: While most don’t expect a fully functional robotaxi that can be deployed right away, it’s what CEO Elon Musk and Tesla can do to paint a picture of autonomous self-driving that the company envisions for the next five or 10 years down the road that matters. Possible leaks have already surfaced suggesting Tesla may strike a robo-delivery deal with DoorDash, for instance. (Yahoo Finance could not verify those reports.) Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who named Tesla his “top pick” in the autos space, has nonetheless advised clients to “keep expectations well managed” for the event. What will most likely be on display is a demonstration of the latest iteration of FSD (full self-driving) software and a demonstration of a fully autonomous \"cybercab\" in a closed or semi-closed course, Jonas wrote last month. But in a more recent note last week, Jonas said investors may hear more about how those cybercabs, or robotaxis, will be deployed. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Columnist Kerry Hannon writes: The increase in Social Security benefits next year will be pocket-sized. The Social Security administration announced a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2025. That’s down from 3.2% this year but in line with the 2.6% average over the past two decades. Starting in January, the increase will add a little under $50 to the average monthly benefit of roughly $1,900, according to the SSA, providing some comfort to the more than 72 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who have grappled with higher prices in recent years. Read more here. Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic told the Wall Street Journal in an interview he'd be \"comfortable with skipping a meeting if the data suggests that’s appropriate.\" Additionally, Bostic told the Journal's Nick Timiraos that he only penciled in one additional interest rate cut for 2024 in his most recent submission to the Summary of Economic Projections. “So that already signals that I’m open to not moving at one of the last two meetings if the data comes in as I expect,” Bostic said. Bostic's commentary comes after a hotter-than-expected September jobs report and a reading on inflation for September, which showed price increases not cooling as fast as hoped, have fueled investor bets that the Fed may not reduce interest rates further at its November meeting. Traders now see a 15% chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Just a week ago, the odds of no cut were at 0%. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose sharply last week, a new challenge for beleaguered house hunters and potential refinancing candidates. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan jumped to 6.32% for the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac, up from 6.12% a week earlier. It’s the biggest week-over-week increase since April. Read more here. WW International (WW), better known as WeightWatchers, surged more than 15% Thursday. The stock has gone on a furious rally this week following the company's announcement that it will offer a copycat of weight-loss drugs like those from Novo Nordisk (NVO). WeightWatchers shares were up 38% Wednesday, and the stock is up nearly 160% from last week but remains far from record highs around $100 in 2018. The company has struggled amid heightened competition in the weight loss space, an unsuccessful rebrand, and disruptions related to COVID-19. US laws permit companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the Food and Drug Administration's shortage list. The federal agency recently removed tirzepatide from the list, which is the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's (LLY) GLP-1 drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro. WeightWatchers will sell a compounded version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy. Oil gained as much as 2% on Thursday as traders assessed whether ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran will result in a supply disruption. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded above $74 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, jumped more than 2% to hover around $78 per barrel. \"Crude [is] continuing to find equilibrium value lifting prices today as uncertainty remains over when and where Israel will strike into Hezbollah and Iran,\" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading for BOK Financial Securities, said in a note on Thursday. Hurricane Milton's Florida landfall also kept the markets on edge. Production and refinery activity was not expected to be disrupted. However, analysts anticipated an interruption of distribution around the impacted areas as gas stations ran low on supplies. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: A warmer-than-expected inflation reading released Thursday offers new ammunition for Federal Reserve hawks who are arguing for a gradual pace of interest rate cuts. This report, according to some Fed watchers, is unlikely to change the path outlined by policymakers for smaller future cuts following an initial 50 basis point reduction in September. Investors, in fact, boosted the odds that the Fed will trim its policy rate by 25 basis points in November to 87% following the CPI release. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports: September's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came in hotter than analysts expected, but the data offered one major point of optimism: Shelter cost increases came down during the month, flashing an encouraging economic signal that the most stubborn contributor to inflation may finally be giving ground. \"The sharp reversal in shelter inflation allays fears that it could reaccelerate after the jump in August and brings the trend back toward the gradual disinflation that we continue to expect,\" said Parker Ross, global chief economist at Arch Capital Group Read more here. Falling gasoline prices were not enough to offset higher food and shelter prices in September, contributing to a hotter-than-expected inflation print. The gasoline index decreased 4.1% last month, compared to a decline of 0.6% in the prior month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. On an annualized basis, gasoline prices dropped 15.3%, while the energy index as a whole decreased 6.8%. Read more here. The major averages opened lower on Thursday after the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in hotter than expected, setting the expectation that the Federal Reserve will opt for a smaller rate cut at its meeting next month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (^DJI) fell nearly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed roughly 0.3%. Both slipped from their fresh record-high closes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped 0.5%. Technology (XLK) stocks led the declines, followed by Consumer Discretionary (XLY). On the flip side, Energy (XLE) stocks rose as oil jumped Thursday morning. Investors may be anticipating the Federal Reserve's next interest rate cut will be 25 basis points rather than 50 after inflation rose by 0.2% in September, more than the 0.1% rise Wall Street was expecting, according to the latest government data. Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported third quarter earnings that missed Wall Street's expectations Thursday morning, Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith reports. The miss sent its stock down as much as 7% in premarket trading before paring losses. Here's a look at its performance compared to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Delta said it forecasts earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.85 for the fourth quarter, with its $1.73 midpoint slightly below the $1.78 Wall Street analysts had expected, according to Bloomberg data. Delta CEO Ed Bastian blamed disruptions caused by a widespread CrowdStrike outage in mid-July. Issues with CrowdStrike's cybersecurity software, used by Delta, forced the airline to cancel thousands of flights and wiped $380 million from its revenue for the quarter, he said. “We had 86 great days and we had five days that were impacted, caused by CrowdStrike,” Bastian told Yahoo Finance. Read the full story here. Weekly jobless claims rose more than expected last week in the latest sign that, while the labor market has shown some strength, there is still cooling in the jobs market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 258,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Oct. 5, up from 225,000 the week prior and above the 230,000 economists had expected. This marked the highest weekly unemployment claims since August 2023. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.86 million, up by 42,000 from the week prior. A closely watched report on US inflation showed consumer prices rose more than expected in September, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.4% over the prior year in September, an acceleration compared to August's 2.5% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase was higher than the 2.3% economists had expected. The index rose 0.2% over the previous month, above Wall Street's expectation for a 0.1% increase. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in September climbed 0.3% over the prior month and 2.4% over last year. Core prices rose 0.3% month over month and 3.2% on an annual basis in August. Both the monthly and yearly core readings were hotter than economists had projected. ",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose nearly 1% to notch a new record high on Friday, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.6% to close above 5,800 for the first time ever.

Next week, earnings season continues in full swing, with Citi (C), United Airlines (UAL), AI chip equipment maker ASML (ASML), Netflix (NFLX), and American Express (AXP) expected to report. On the cusp of another earnings season, it seems like quarterly results are far from the forefront of investors' minds, writes Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman. After a hot jobs report and a consumer inflation reading that didn’t put to bed concerns about rising prices, there’s more confusion than usual about what the Federal Reserve will do next with rates. Hopes for China stimulus and its ripple effect have sprung up, but the picture there remains murky as well, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in Chinese stocks. Throw in a couple of literal hurricanes and a figurative one in the Mideast, and investors have a lot to weigh when making decisions. “I think this earnings season is going to be pretty tricky,” Ohsung Kwon, US and Canada equity strategist at Bank of America, said in a recent interview. \"Now that the easing cycle has started, what are companies going to say about any early indications of improvement given the lower rate environment?” Wherever the forecasts land, “As long as companies have managed through macro headwinds and see early signs of improvement from lower rates, stocks should get rewarded,” Kwon wrote.

Boeing stock (BA) bounced up 2% from its its 52-week low on Friday as the plane maker took a tougher stance with its biggest union after a breakdown in negotiations this week left little hope of a quick resolution to an ongoing labor strike. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré reports that the plane maker on Thursday filed an unfair labor practice charge against representatives of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), claiming \"bad-faith bargaining.\" The move comes days after bargaining talks involving mediators broke down and Boeing withdrew its contract proposal on Tuesday. The labor strike is proving costly on several fronts for Boeing. The work stoppage has interrupted the company's recovery efforts to ramp up production of its bestselling 737 Max jets to 38 per month by the end of the year, up from roughly 25 per month in June and July. Earlier this week S&P Global placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the work stoppage continues until the end of the year. Riskier credit makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to borrow money. Read the full story on the implications for the ongoing strike here.

The investment giant posted record assets under management (AUM) for the quarter, reaching $11.5 trillion. Tesla (TSLA): Shares of the electric vehicle maker sank more than 8% Friday morning after CEO Elon Musk revealed the long-awaited driverless robotaxi on Thursday night, which left investors wanting more. The Cybercab features no steering wheels or pedals, and is designed to be fully autonomous. AO Smith (AOS): The maker of water heaters sank more than 5% after the company cut its earnings outlook for the fiscal year, which also dropped below analyst expectations. AO Smith also lowered its net sales forecasts Trump Media (DJT): Shares of the former president's media and tech company rose nearly 8% Friday morning, following an announced release of its Truth+ streaming app for Android devices on Thursday. The gains build on momentum from earlier in the week — its longest rally since June — as investors also assess Trump's standing in the presidential election. Shares of the ride-hailing company Uber (UBER) and its chief rival, Lyft (LYFT), both rose more than 10% Friday afternoon, with Uber reaching record levels as investors appeared unimpressed with Tesla's robotaxi unveiling. Tesla has envisioned a fleet of driverless taxis that users could summon on their phones, which could pose new competition to the app-based transportation platforms. But analysts critical of the demonstration said Musk failed to deliver key details on the self-driving taxi rollout, giving the transportation companies a boost. Jefferies analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets\" with “little evidence of feasibility.” On the other hand, more bullish analysts see an optimistic future for Tesla's ambitious plans. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said in a note on Friday that Tesla could ramp to 100,000 Cybercabs by 2027, with production possibly beginning in 2026. Investors pushed the stocks of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) higher Friday after third quarter results looked better than feared, a demonstration of resilience from the banking giants that points to the possibility of a soft landing for the US economy, reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. One JPMorgan executive was even willing to connect the bank’s performance to that soft landing, citing strength on the part of the lender’s consumer and corporate customers. An economy that achieves a soft landing is one where inflation slows without causing a recession. \"Broadly, I would say these earnings are consistent with the soft-landing narrative,\" the bank's CFO, Jeremy Barnum, told reporters. And the fact that companies are optimistic, he added, is \"pretty consistent with this kind of Goldilocks economic situation.\" The results kicked off a third quarter earnings season as lenders face questions about how a new Federal Reserve rate-cutting cycle will affect the biggest US banks over the next year. Read more here. The initial reaction on Wall Street to Tesla's robotaxi unveiling was underwhelming, sending the stock about 8% lower. But to the company's supporters, the event delivered on Musk's vision of pushing the electric vehicle maker to be more than merely a car company. Dan Ives, a vocal supporter of Musk's autonomous future, agreed with the skeptics asking for more details about Tesla's ambitious autonomous vision. But in a note on Friday, he said, \"We strongly disagree with the notion that last night was a disappointment as we would argue the opposite seeing Cybercab with our own eyes and the massive improvements in Optimus which we interacted with throughout the evening.\" Optimus is Tesla's humanoid robot, several of which walked into the event space on their own during the demonstration. Musk said the robots would likely cost between $20,000 and $30,000 when they eventually go on sale years from now — a claim he has made in the past. \"Optimus is going to become a bigger piece of the Tesla story and now there is no credit for this ground breaking robotic future in Tesla's current valuation,\" said Ives.

The Cybercab features no steering wheels or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous. JPMorgan (JPM): The financial services company rose almost 5% after reporting third quarter earnings that revealed a surprise gain in net interest income and raised its full-year forecast.

The gains build on momentum from earlier in the week — its longest rally since June — as investors also assess Trump's standing in the presidential election. US stocks traveled without strong direction Friday morning as the big US banks kicked off earnings season and investors considered how a hotter-than-expected inflation report and unchanged wholesale inflation would steer Federal Reserve policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.4% in morning trading, paring deeper premarket losses as big bank financial updates rolled in. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ticked over the flat line, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3% after closing out Thursday with small losses. All three major gauges were on track for wins for the week. Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), JPMorgan (JPM), and BNY Mellon (BK) stocks rose Friday morning as investors cheered the first wave of bank earnings. Wells Fargo jumped 5% after its earnings per share handily beat Wall Street's forecasts. Its adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 surpassed the analyst consensus of $1.25 per share, according to Bloomberg data. Still, the bank reported a drop in net interest income and its profit fell 11%. BNY Mellon and BlackRock also surpassed Wall Street's forecasts. BNY Mellon ticked up 0.5% after posting a 16% jump in profit. BlackRock rose 1.7% after reporting a record of $11.5 trillion in assets. JPMorgan (JPM) rose 3.5% as its Wall Street operations beat expectations, even though profits fell, Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports. Read the full story on what JPM's third quarter results say about the US economy here. Trump Media (DJT) stock jumped 11% premarket Friday before paring gains as the company continues its week-long rally. DJT was up 6% to $25.66 after the bell. Shares jumped 17% during Thursday's session following the company's launch of its Truth+ streaming app, which makes Trump Media TV programming available to Android users. The stock's climb extended gains earlier this week as investors responded to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's surprise appearance at a Trump rally over the weekend, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reported. DJT is beginning to recover after hitting its lowest level since the social media company went public last month. Shares remain far below highs above $70 reached in March. The stock has been volatile and likened to a meme stock, with investors responding to the ups and downs of the former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign. Read Alexandra Canal's recent coverage of the stock here. Over a piece of braised short rib at the NYC Marriott Marquis last night, I got to sit among some amazing business news journalists at the annual Knight-Bagehot dinner and listen to a 20-minute chat between journalist Alan Murray and billionaire financier at Citadel, Ken Griffin. A lot of us in the room thought it was weird to see Griffin do the keynote fireside chat. A billionaire who got pulled through the mud during the meme stock craze waxing poetic about how reading Wall Street Journal articles about KKR's Henry Kravis when he was a teen inspired him to become a hedge fund king? The eye rolls were plentiful in the room. However, Griffin did give us journos some red meat at the end of the conversation. “I know who I am voting for, and it won’t be with a smile on my face,” Griffin said. I suppose that means Harris, but who knows! Reuters has the details, and Kathy Jones at the Schwab Center for Financial Research has some quick analysis: Tesla stock (TSLA) sank 6% premarket Friday as investors reacted to the EV maker's robotaxi unveiling. Elon Musk has lofty ideas about the future of Tesla's self-driving vehicles, and the recent event tested Wall Street's appetite for that vision. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports that the \"We, Robot\" event left investors wanting more. Musk unveiled a $30,000 autonomous \"Cybercab,\" arriving sometime in 2026. Tesla did not reveal its upcoming lower-cost “next-gen” model, which many analysts had expected, Subramanian reported. The sub-$30K next-gen EV will arrive later this year, Tesla has previously confirmed. Tesla stock has been on a wild ride recently, rising on prior hopes for the robotaxi unveiling before falling after the company's third quarter deliveries disappointed. Tesla shares are down 8% from last year. Uber stock (UBER), meanwhile, rose 5% in premarket trading. Read the full story on Tesla's robotaxi debut here. DETROIT (Reuters) — Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) confirmed on Thursday that CEO Carlos Tavares would retire at the end of his contract in early 2026 and announced major senior management changes as it struggles to turn around its lagging North American operations. Reasonable quarter out of JPMorgan (JPM) this morning. Read more from our banking reporter David Hollerith. I hopped on JPM's earnings media call and asked CFO Jeremy Barnum his views on housing post Fed rate cut. All in all, it didn't sound like a housing boom was taking shape with lower rates — but activity has picked up. Here's what Barnum told me (emphasis ours): “What we did see, as you kind of would expect, is a pickup in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of increase in refinancings there, which, again, you would also expect. But it's worth noting, when it comes to mortgages, that all of the sequential and year-on-year changes are coming off a very low base, and it remains the case that the vast majority of the stock of outstanding mortgages right now in this country are below 6% with a lot of them still even below 5%. So it would take a really big rally in the long end of the yield curve to see a significant pickup in refinancing. The house view on home prices, you know, I think generally you've got a tension there between possibly a slightly weakening economy that should create a little bit more supply, there's a little bit more construction, but there's generally a housing shortage in this country. So the housing market seems to me is still a little bit stuck, I would say.” ",

        "body": "Celero Commerce, the payments company backed by LLR Partners, is up for sale and has hired an investment bank to advise on the process, according to four banking and private equity executives. The execs predict the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company could sell for roughly $600 million, or 12 times Celero’s trailing Ebitda of $50 million. Celero is in the “back half’ of a process that has attracted private equity, they said. LLR, a lower middle market PE firm, formed Celero in late 2018 when it invested in UMS Banking, a merchant acquirer. Celero has remained very acquisitive, buying about 10 companies since then, including RazorSync in 2019, TransNational Payments in 2020, and this past August, it scooped up SONA. LLR and Celero did not return messages for comment. News of the Celero sale comes as mergers remain slow. The number of U.S. announced transactions so far this year has dropped about 8% to 7,993, totaling $1.2 trillion as of Oct. 7, according to data from Dealogic. That figure represents a 17% jump in value compared to 2023 when 8,660 mergers totaled $1 trillion, according to Dealogic. While there are lots of discussions going on, sales are harder to get done this year, one fintech banker said. Mergers typically slow down ahead of the U.S. presidential election with many expecting deals to return next year. “Buyers aren’t ready to spend on these M&A situations as easily as they used to in the past. That’s the issue,” one banker said. In another fintech development, Finexio, the payments startup backed by JPMorgan, is seeking a minority round of capital, according to three banking sources. Finexio has hired an investment bank to advise on the fundraise, they said. In 2015, Ernest Rolfson, a former Mastercard executive, founded Finexio, which seeks to simplify the accounts payable process for medium and large companies. The company provides software that converts paper checks to electronic payments. Finexio has introduced a Card by Mail product which seeks to blend the comfort of paper checks with the efficiency of digital payments, according to an April blog post. Despite the shift to digital, some businesses continue to use legacy payment methods. About 75% of organizations use paper checks despite the high costs, according to a study from PYMNTS Intelligence. Finexio has raised about $83.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. JPMorgan, an active fintech acquirer, was the largest investor of Finexio’s $35 million B round that it raised in October 2022. Discover Financial Services and Valley Bank also took part. The B round valued Finexio at $100 million. (Capital One’s more than $35 billion buy of Discover is expected to close later this year or early 2025.)   ",

        "body": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares rose Friday morning after reporting revenue and net interest income growth in its third-quarter results Friday as big banks' earnings season gets under way. The world's largest bank by market cap posted revenue of $42.65 billion, well above the $39.87 billion it reported a year ago and the $40.85 billion consensus estimate of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha. Reported net interest income (NII) rose to $23.41 billion from $22.73 billion. Profit fell slightly to $12.9 billion from $13.15 billion, but edged higher to $4.37 from $4.33 on a per-share basis. Analysts were expecting $11.81 billion, or $3.97 per share. JPMorgan shares, which had risen about 25% this year through Thursday's close, were up just under 2% in premarket trading after the report's release. Higher interest rates in recent years helped JPMorgan and other banks reach record levels of net interest income, but rising deposit costs have impacted bank earnings in recent quarters while loan growth has stalled. JPMorgan and other banks are reporting earnings amid a shifting economic environment, as the Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the first time since 2020. Analysts expect that the newly lowered rates and potential for future cuts should help lower deposit costs and spark more investment banking and loan growth in the coming quarters. Analyst and investor attention has also focused recently on how JPMorgan will form a succession plan for 68-year-old Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jamie Dimon. The influential executive has said in recent months that the bank wants to make sure it gets the plan right when he steps away in the coming years. Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

        "body": "Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 26 cents per share ($1.04 a year). To earn $500 monthly from the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm, start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Bank of America's $1.04 dividend: $6,000 / $1.04 = 5,769 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $230,587 worth of Bank of America, or 5,769 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares, or $46,125 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). View more earnings on BAC Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. Price Action: Shares of Bank of America fell by 0.6% to close at $39.97 on Thursday. The firm will release earnings results for its third quarter before the opening bell on Tuesday, Oct. 15, Analysts expect Bank of America to report quarterly earnings at 77 cents per share. That’s down from 90 cents per share in the year-ago period. Bank of America projects to report revenue of $25.29 billion for the recent quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Most Read from Fast Company Why this Florida neighborhood still has power Aurora borealis watch: Northern lights may be visible again tonight. Here’s where and when to see them Candy and snack recall, FDA update: List of products that may be contaminated with salmonella After hitting a 16-month low of 6.11% in early September, the average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate tracked by Mortgage News Daily has ticked back up, reaching 6.62% on Tuesday. That increase will likely dampen some of the refinancing activity, which had started to gain a bit of momentum as some borrowers with 7% and 8% mortgage rates took the opportunity to get some relief. According to a new survey by John Burns Research and Consulting (JBREC), neither the 6.11% rate nor today’s 6.62% was going to do too much to motivate homeowners who would like to sell but are staying put because of mortgage rates. At what mortgage rate level would resale turnover—currently hovering at multi-decade lows—really pick up? The “magic mortgage rate” that JBREC says would truly unlock the housing market is below 5.5%. The research firm has held this view for a while and reaffirmed it last week, citing its September 2024 survey. Only 13% of homeowners surveyed by JBREC said they would accept a mortgage rate between 6.5% and 6.99% on their next home. But 47% said they would accept a mortgage rate between 5.0% and 5.5%. Why have mortgage rates bounced up over the past week? The latest employment reports have come in a bit warmer than expected, with the U.S. unemployment rate falling from 4.3% in July 2024 to 4.1% in September 2024. After rising from the cycle low of 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.3% in July 2024, some analysts were concerned this could signal a sharp labor market slowdown or recession. However, the latest jobs numbers have eased those fears somewhat and placed a little upward pressure on long-term yields, including mortgage rates.

The U.S. producer price index for final demand was unchanged in September, slightly below the forecast of economists polled by Reuters for a gain of 0.1%. It followed an unrevised 0.2% increase in August, indicating inflation continues to cool and giving the Fed leeway to continue cutting interest rates. In the 12 months through September, the PPI increased 1.8% versus the 1.6% estimate. On Thursday, the consumer price index turned out to be slightly higher than expected as goods costs increased. The University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 68.9 this month, compared with a final reading of 70.1 in September and below the 70.8 estimate as high prices discouraged shopping. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks advanced, with the Dow and S&P 500 closing at record highs, as bank shares jumped 4.21%, its biggest daily percentage gain since May 2023, at the start of the quarterly earnings season. JP Morgan rose 4.44% and Wells Fargo shot up 5.61%. \"As we get to the latter part of this year and into next year, you're going to see earnings growth in the broader market and not just a small group of stocks and what the banks are telling us today is that's happening,\" said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Amundi U.S. in Boston. \"Banks have been as big a question mark as anybody - the level of rates, the yield curve, capital markets activity, et cetera - and two of our biggest banks today are saying well everything's going to be pretty good.\" S&P 500 earnings growth is expected to be 4.9%, LSEG data showed, down slightly from 5.2% at the start of October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 409.74 points, or 0.97%, to 42,863.86, the S&P 500 rose 34.98 points, or 0.61%, to 5,815.03 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 60.89 points, or 0.33%, to 18,342.94. Gains were capped, however, by an 8.78% tumble in Tesla shares as the electric vehicle maker promised much at its robotaxi event with few practical details. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 4.56 points, or 0.54%, to 852.75 and was on track for its fourth weekly gain in five weeks.

        "body": "Tesla (TSLA) stock sank more than 7% Friday midday as investors signaled disappointment over the EV maker’s robotaxi debut. Following the event on Thursday night, “We, Robot” — which aimed to cement CEO Elon Musk’s position as an AI leader — investors and analysts came away with more skepticism than excitement over Tesla’s lofty vision for a future of driverless cabs. Jefferies (JEF) analysts called Tesla’s $30,000 robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a “toothless taxi” in a note to investors Friday morning, adding that Tesla has “ambitious targets\" with “little evidence of feasibility.” “We believe TSLA potentially underappreciates the obstacles to scaling a robotaxi fleet,” they wrote. Tesla’s new Cybercab has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to be fully autonomous, Yahoo Finance’s Pras Subramanian reported. The company said it will begin unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) trials with Model 3 and Model Y test vehicles next year in Texas and California. Tesla is aiming to begin Cybercab production “before 2027,” Musk said. Tesla’s stock drop on Friday extended a two-week decline. TSLA shares fell last week after the company missed Wall Street estimates on its third quarter deliveries, issued a recall, and discontinued a lower-priced model. The stock — which has experienced far more volatility over the past year than its Magnificent Seven peers — is down 17% from last year. Still, TSLA’s Friday price of $220 per share is far higher than lows below $140 this spring. Shares hit a 15-month low in April amid Tesla’s layoffs and price cuts. Investors and analysts had hoped the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event would live up to the hype but were disappointed by Musk’s lack of clarity over how the company would achieve its ambitious goals. Raymond James (RJF) analyst Josh Beck called Tesla’s plan to commercialize its Cybercabs “vague” and “underwhelming.” Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts said the event included a “disappointing lack of detail” about updates to Tesla's FSD technology and market strategy. RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan concurred, writing in a note Friday that investors believe Musk’s vision “was light of real numbers and timelines.” “These typically come at Tesla events,” he added. “This one seemed focused on branding and marketing Tesla's vision, rather than giving concrete numbers for us to model out.” Additionally, Tesla did not reveal details about a lower-priced vehicle as some investors had hoped. That vehicle is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, analysts noted. To be sure, some experts on Wall Street think “We, Robot” was a success. Bank of America analysts said the robotaxi event “lived up to the hype.”           ",

Another prediction market, Kalshi, which just recently won permission to list contracts based on U.S. elections, also shows Trump in the lead over Harris: 52% to 48%. PredictIt, meanwhile, shows a slimmer Trump lead: 53% to 52%. Polymarket is not technically available to Americans, though VPN users likely sidestep that restriction. Kalshi and PredictIt are allowed in the U.S., however.  ",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The way Jeff deGraaf sees it, hedge funds that sold a record amount of Chinese shares earlier this week toward the end of the CSI 300’s 10-day, 35% surge are in for a world of regret. Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? In fact, says the co-founder and chief executive officer of Renaissance Macro Research, rarely in his more than three-decade Wall Street career have the stars aligned so perfectly for a lengthy rally. “Skepticism, valuation, stimulus, momentum and a trend change,” they’re all there, he said in an interview. It’s because of that backdrop that the Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch veteran is now one of the biggest China bulls on Wall Street. He predicts the country’s benchmark gauge will hit 6,000 in the next 12 months, a more than 50% advance. DeGraaf, who ranked as the top technical analyst in Institutional Investor’s annual survey for 11 straight years through 2015, says that it’s no coincidence that Beijing rolled out its most aggressive monetary easing in years as equities tested their year-to-date lows last month. “Markets drive policy as much as policy drives markets,” he said. His forecast compares with Morgan Stanley’s newly revised CSI 300 target of 4,000 by June 2025, implying virtually no upside from Thursday’s close. The index plunged 7.1% on Wednesday, the second day mainland markets reopened after the Golden Week holidays. While it rose 1% Thursday, enthusiasm over a stimulus-driven equity surge is cooling due to the lack of any further major initiatives at a key policy meeting earlier this week. DeGraaf recommends investors “keep stops in place and don’t get dogmatic” when wagering on China. For now, traders are awaiting the outcome of a finance ministry briefing on fiscal policy due Saturday. “We see the policy response as self-preservation, a reaction to the weakness and a potential Mario Draghi-esque ‘Do what it takes’ moment for China,” deGraaf said. The former Lehman chief technical analyst also downplayed potential risks to Chinese shares from the upcoming US presidential election. It’s a “side show, probably doesn’t matter much, and a reaction would be an opportunity,” he said.

        "body": "Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) will release earnings results for its third quarter before the opening bell on Friday, Oct. 11. Analysts expect the San Francisco-based bank to report quarterly earnings at $1.28 per share, down from $1.48 per share in the year-ago period. Wells Fargo projects to report revenue of $20.41 billion for the recent quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Some Wells Fargo investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Wells Fargo currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.78%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share ($1.60 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Wells Fargo, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Wells Fargo's $1.60 dividend: $6,000 / $1.60 = 3,750 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $215,775 worth of Wells Fargo, or 3,750 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.60 = 750 shares, or $43,155 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. View more earnings on WFC The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.  Price Action: Shares of Wells Fargo gained by 0.4% to close at $57.54 on Wednesday. On Oct. 8, Wolfe Research analyst Steven Chubak upgraded Wells Fargo from Peer Perform to Outperform and announced a $65 price target.

Major financial companies kicked off earnings season with JPMorgan Chase finishing the session up 4.4% after the lender reported higher-than-expected third-quarter profit and raised its annual interest income forecast. Shares in Wells Fargo rallied 5.6% after its profit also beat analysts' expectations. BlackRock stock gained 3.6% after the asset manager reported that its assets under management had hit a record high for the third straight quarter. Other stocks in the industry rose broadly, making the S&P 500 Financials index the biggest index points boost for the benchmark. \"We'd some good earnings reports from some leading financial companies. That's a good start to earnings season,\" said Evan Brown, Portfolio Manager and Head of Multi-Asset Strategy, UBS Asset Management, adding that it bodes well for the economy. \"When financials do well, this is what a soft landing looks like. It's a positive overall sign for the economy and sets a positive tone for earnings releases in other industries in the next few weeks.\" For the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 409.74 points, or 0.97%, to 42,863.86, the S&P 500 gained 34.98 points, or 0.61%, to 5,815.03 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 60.89 points, or 0.33%, to 18,342.94. For the week, the S&P 500 added 1.1% while the Dow climbed 1.2% and the Nasdaq added 1.1% with all three notching their fifth weekly gain in a row. Earlier in the day, data from the U.S. Department of Labor showed the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand was unchanged on a monthly basis in September, compared to the 0.1% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters. Friday's PPI data follows Thursday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, which was slightly higher than forecast, although weekly jobless claims rose more than expected. \"The market's pretty convinced that we're going to have a soft landing and that inflation, even with CPI being a little bit higher than expected yesterday, is going to be moderate,\" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. \"If you look at today's PPI data, the core and final demand were both a little lower than expected ... Inflation's certainly been moderating and that's a positive that the market paid attention to.\"         ",

        "body": "The stock market has been on a tear in 2024, with the S&P 500 rising by nearly 21 percent over the first three quarters of the year. But the situation may not be so brisk over the coming 12 months, say analysts in Bankrate’s Third-Quarter Market Mavens Survey. These pros expect the market to rise just 4.1 percent over the coming four quarters, below its long-term annual average of 10 percent. The survey’s respondents see the S&P 500 climbing from 5,738 at the end of the survey period to 5,975 by the end of the third quarter of 2025. It’s the 16th straight survey where the analysts have projected a gain in the year ahead. The analysts also preferred U.S. stocks over international ones, and they think value stocks will outperform growth stocks over a similar time frame. “Reflecting multiple sources of uncertainty, there are some reasons to be cautious about the outlook,” says Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst. “Even so, the resilience of the U.S. economy and the stock market’s ability to power through multiple threats taken together have been nothing short of remarkable.” Here are the highlights from Bankrate’s quarterly Market Mavens Survey. This article is one in a series discussing the results of Bankrate’s Third-Quarter 2024 Market Mavens Survey: Survey: Market strategists see 10-year Treasury yield at 3.5% a year from now Best moves for long-term investors with stocks near all-time highs, according to market experts Stock market outlook for the next 12 months: Here’s what top analysts are predicting into 2025 The S&P 500 has had a really strong run since the start of 2023, and while it’s definitely had some hiccups in 2024, this year has been notably strong, too. But the market pros surveyed by Bankrate expected more muted returns over the next 12 months. The average estimate for the S&P 500 is 5,975 for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2025 — up 4.1 percent from 5,738 at the end of the recent survey period on Sept. 27, 2024. In the second-quarter survey, analysts estimated a similar 4 percent gain in the year ahead. “The major averages have fared remarkably well even when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates to the highest levels in years,” says Hamrick. “Now that the central bank has begun an easing cycle, the notion ‘don’t fight the Fed’ should provide some reassurance. At the same time, the Fed’s mandate has nothing to do with preserving stock market gains or momentum.” “It looks like the Fed can avoid recession, but it’s much too early to have great conviction,” says Michael K. Farr, president and CEO, Farr, Miller & Washington.                                       ",

The company also announced updated Phase 1b data on ACTengine IMA203 TCR-T targeting PRAME in melanoma patients and provided an update on SUPRAME, the upcoming Phase 3 trial to evaluate IMA203 in metastatic melanoma patients. As of August 23, 2024, 28 heavily pretreated patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with IMA203 at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D, 1 to 10 billion total TCR-T cells) during the Phase 1b dose expansion part of the clinical trial. IMA203 monotherapy has maintained a favorable tolerability profile with no treatment-related Grade 5 adverse events in the safety population, even at doses up to ~10×10 power 9 TCR-T cells. The data presented demonstrate a significant positive shift in median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) between melanoma patients treated during Phase 1a and patients treated in Phase 1b. In addition, approximately half of all patients in the Phase 1b trial have a deep response (>50% tumor reduction). This subgroup of patients was observed to have a median PFS of more than one year, while patients with <50% tumor reduction (including patients with tumor size increase) were still observed with a more than 2 times longer median PFS compared to patients treated in dose escalation with suboptimal doses. Translational data from patients across Phase 1a and Phase 1b indicate that IMA203 T cells rapidly engrafted in all patients after a single dose and show a persistence of more than two years. The Phase 3 trial will evaluate IMA203 targeting PRAME in 360 HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with second-line or later unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The Phase 3 trial is on track to commence in December 2024 and patient enrollment is forecasted to be completed in 2026. A pre-specified interim analysis is planned for early 2026. The company aims to submit an FDA marketing application in early 2027 for full approval. Price Action: IMTX stock is down 11.1% at $9.841 at last check Thursday.

        "body": "We talk about the digital economy, or the consumer economy, and even sometimes about the manufacturing sector – but the truth is, these are all interrelated and cannot be fully atomized. The glue that holds them together is the transport sector, the unsung transportation companies that move people and goods wherever they are wanted and needed. This is big business. According to Mordor Intelligence, the US freight and logistics sector will total more than $1.33 trillion this year, and reach $1.67 trillion by the end of the decade. While freight and transportation stocks are vulnerable to cyclical changes and headwinds – demand can be fickle, consumer desires can change – there is always a need for freight and transport services. Indeed, Citi analyst Ari Rosa is telling investors that the transport sector is primed for gains going forward, writing in a recent note: “We believe select Transportation and Logistics stocks are well-positioned to deliver strong relative outperformance in the year ahead. This view is supported by our analysis that suggests the cyclical downturn in transports is in its late stages, with rates and margins near trough, offering the prospect of strong earnings growth in 2025 and into 2026 as rates recover…” “In our view,” adds Rosa, “investors should be positioned for a cyclical recovery, with attractive opportunities in companies that are leveraged to realize outsized benefits as freight conditions tighten.” With this outlook in mind, Rosa has pinpointed two top transportation stocks for investors to keep an eye on. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve taken a deeper dive to assess whether these picks truly hold up. JB Hunt (JBHT) First on the list is JB Hunt, the $16.8 billion trucking and logistics firm founded in Arkansas back in 1961. Today, JB Hunt is the 12th largest transport company, of any type, in the US – and one of the five largest trucking companies. The company has brought a 21st-century business approach to the trucking sector, investing heavily in its people, its technology, and its transport capacity to build out North America’s most efficient transport network. JB Hunt offers a wide range of trucking and transport services, including intermodal freight, moving containers from rail to truck and truck to rail; dedicated trucking, offering contract fleet services to enterprise customers; full truckload and less-than-truckload shipping and contract shipping services; and even ‘last mile’ delivery. These are the mainstays of the trucking sector, making freight delivery scalable, flexible, and timely – and JB Hunt has proven expertise at all of them.                ",

Traders see the latest data solidifying odds of a 25 basis point rate cut next month. US stocks edged lower on Thursday as investors took in slightly hotter-than-expected inflation data after last week's blockbuster jobs report. The consumer price index showed prices increased 2.4% year-over-year in September, which came in just above consensus forecasts of a 2.3% rise. The core CPI reading, which excludes food and energy costs, came in at 3.3% year-over-year, slightly above forecasts of 3.2% and 0.3% higher than the August reading. Analysts are now shifting their expectations for further easing from the Federal Reserve as inflation cools slightly slower than expected, and as last week's blockbuster jobs report showed a hot economy with 254,000 jobs added last month. The jobs report dashed hopes of another jumbo 50-basis point cut, but the slight upside surprise in CPI likely isn't enough to prompt a complete pause on Fed easing. \"There is only one more set of inflation reports between now and then, and even a firm upside surprise could be discounted as normal monthly volatility on the path back toward the 2% target,\" JPMorgan analysts said in a Friday note after the jobs report. Investors now see a 25-basis point rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month more likely compared to leaving rates unchanged, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Weekly jobless claims, meanwhile, climbed 33,000 to 258,000, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. That surpassed forecasts of 230,000 and marks the data point's highest level in over a year. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: S&P 500: 5,774.06, down 0.32% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 42,429.01, down 0.2% (-82.99 points) Nasdaq composite: 18,218.14, down 0.41% Here's what else was going on Thursday: FEMA was strapped for cash even before Hurricanes Helene and Milton blew through the South.

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose to records Friday as big banks rallied following a run of reassuring profit reports. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to top its all-time high set earlier in the week and close out its fifth straight winning week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 409 points, or 1%, to set its own record. The Nasdaq composite lagged the market with a gain of 0.3% after a slide for Tesla kept it in check. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other things. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. It was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500. CEO Jamie Dimon said the nation’s largest bank is also still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, but the pace is modest “given that market levels are at least slightly inflated.” BlackRock, meanwhile, rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 8.8% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the “Cybercab,” potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.98 points to 5,815.03. The Dow rallied 409.74 to 42,863.86, and the Nasdaq composite gained 60.89 to 18,342.94. Another automaker, Stellantis, saw its European-traded shares sink 2.8% after it announced some significant leadership changes, including the timing of CEO Carlos Tavares’ retirement. Its chief financial officer is also departing as the company formed by the merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler struggles to revive sales in North America. In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed following the latest updates on inflation at the wholesale level and on sentiment among U.S. consumers. Prices paid by producers were 1.8% higher in September than a year earlier. That was an improvement from August’s year-over-year inflation level, but not as much as economists expected. Analysts said it likely helped calm worries stirred a day earlier, when a report showed inflation at the consumer level wasn’t cooling as quickly as economists expected.           ",

        "body": "Second-quarter earnings at supply chain software provider E2open were negative enough that investors heavily sold off stock Thursday after management tried to put a positive spin on the company’s outlook. At approximately 11:15 a.m. EDT,  E2open (NYSE: ETWO) stock was down about 75 cents per share to $3.32, a drop of 18.4%. It was not a 52-week low for the company; that mark was set with a price of $2.15 almost one year ago exactly at the time it was pushing its CEO out the door. Among the key numbers that investors may have found discouraging was subscription revenue of $131.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. However, that figure was not surprising and actually came toward the high end of the guidance range of $129 million to $132 million that had been provided by the company. But it appears to be the company’s guidance going forward that set off the drop in E2open’s stock price. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, subscription revenue is expected to be $130 million to $133 million. CFO Marj Armstrong said on the conference call with analysts that the figure would represent a drop of 2.1% on the low end from the prior year to an increase of 0.2% on the high end. But she also said E2open expects to have higher “booking and customer retention metrics” in the third quarter sequentially from the second quarter. For all of fiscal 2025, E2open now expects its subscription revenue to be $526 million to $532 million, which would be a negative 2% to negative 1% growth rate. Total revenue for the  company would be $607 million to $616 million, which would be a negative 4% to negative 3% rate compared to the prior year. The continuing weak fiscal performance at E2open comes several months after it announced it was launching a “strategic review” of its future. That announcement in March followed activist investor Elliott Management’s disclosure a few days after that 52-week low a year ago that it had taken a greater-than-13% stake in the company through outright equity ownership and an options position. On the earnings call, CEO Andrew Appel, who has been in the seat since February, said that review was “ongoing.” “Our directors are committed to a careful and thorough evaluation of the options we have available to us,” he said, adding that he would not comment further on the review. The lagging performance of E2open led to the dismissal of Appel’s predecessor, Michael Farlekas, a year ago about the time that 52-week low was reached. Appel was named interim CEO at that time – he had been a director – before being made permanent CEO in February.                 ",

Most Read from Bloomberg San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts The People’s Bank of China will accept applications from eligible securities firms, funds and insurers starting Thursday to obtain highly liquid assets such as government bonds and central bank bills if they provide certain collateral. The size of the tool is 500 billion yuan ($70.6 billion) and can be expanded in the future, the monetary authority said in a statement. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng unveiled the mechanism as part of a stimulus bonanza last month that signaled the government’s intent to draw a line under the slowing economy. The moves fueled a world-beating rally that saw shares rise as much as 30%. The funds obtained through the facility can only go toward investment in the stock market, Pan said at the time. Bonds, stock ETFs, CSI 300 constituent shares and other assets could be used as collateral, the PBOC said Thursday. The latest announcement comes as the stock rally cools on the lack of immediate fiscal stimulus following a weeklong national holiday. Investors are now awaiting a press briefing by Finance Minister Lan Fo’an on Saturday to watch for clues of any steps to boost government borrowing and spending to shore up growth. The CSI 300 Index rebounded on Thursday from a heavy selloff the previous day. It finished up 1.1% at the close, after gyrating between gains and losses earlier. Insurers are likely to be the first to apply for the liquidity tool, partly because their equity holdings match the collateral requirements made by the PBOC, according to Wu Xuan, fund manager at Borui Funds Management. Regulators see insurance funds as a key source of long-term investment into the market, he said. “They are shouldering more of a ‘political task,’” said Wu. “I would expect more details over the coming weeks and the first batch using the tool within two-three months.” Serena Zhou, senior China economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., said the policy is expected to support the market, although she wouldn’t link the timing to the performance of stocks.

September's producer price index was flat, calming inflation concerns amid rising yields. US stocks jumped on Friday, with all three major averages notching a five-week win streak. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs on Friday. The session marked the S&P 500's 45th record closing high this year and the first time the benchmark index climbed above 5,800. The gains came after US mega-banks JPMorgan and Wells Fargo reported upbeat third-quarter results that showed no signs of an imminent consumer slowdown. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release but warned that geopolitical conditions are \"treacherous and getting worse.\" Dimon has long warned investors about rising geopolitical risks. Also helping stocks on Friday was a light print for September's wholesale inflation gauge. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. The cool PPI report came a day after the CPI report was slightly hotter than expected. \"CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not. Overall, these numbers are getting less impactful as inflation moderates. The Fed could still be on track for 25 basis points at the next two meetings. Yields have surged lately, but it's not clear they have much more reason for continued upside,\" TradeStation strategist David Russell told Business Insider. Apart from earnings results, retail sales data, set to be released on October 17, is the next big data release for investors to watch. Bank of America analysts expect September retail sales data to show a 0.8% surge, while consensus estimates expect just 0.2% growth.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk's EV company has returned to being the most shorted stock in the United States. Weakening fundamentals and discounting measures top the list of analyst concerns.  Tesla (TSLA) bulls have robotaxi fever. Shorts are betting they'll be disappointed. As the EV giant prepares to unveil its robotaxi at its much-anticipated event Thursday, the company has found another way to grab the headlines: Elon Musk's company has returned to its old position as the most shorted stock in the U.S. Meanwhile, the stock has been included in Wells Fargo’s latest trading ideas with an underweight call—and skepticism that the robotaxi will deliver on bulls' presumptions. According to data and tech firm Hazeltree, Elon Musk's EV company was the most crowded shorted large-cap security in the Americas in September, returning to a position it held until July. Investors would be less interested in the company—whose stock price has largely recovered from the losses it experienced in the first half of the year—as demand for EVs cooled, though the excitement around the robotaxi could give the stock a boost. Tesla stock is up more than 40% since April 5, when Musk announced plans for the robotaxi event, and it has stayed elevated even after the event was delayed. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan, however, has given Tesla a $120 price target—half its current price—in the bank's tactical trading ideas list for the fourth quarter. Langan wrote that he is skeptical Wednesday's event will “match the high expectations from Tesla bulls, leaving investors to focus on weakening fundamentals.\" Those fundamentals include projections for moderating delivery growth as EV demand drops and the limited potential of discounting to boost sales. He also noted that Musk has promised robotaxis \"by year-end...for years\" but \"experts say the technology is years away & that TSLA’s autonomous technology comes with considerable safety concerns.\" Last week's delivery data sent Tesla stock lower despite beating expectations, as analysts said investors may have wanted Tesla to deliver a stronger quarter. Tesla said Wednesday that its third-quarter results will be released after the market closes on Oct. 23. Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

Let’s take a look at how Werner (NASDAQ:WERN) and the rest of the ground transportation stocks fared in Q2. The growth of e-commerce and global trade continues to drive demand for shipping services, especially last-mile delivery, presenting opportunities for ground transportation companies. The industry continues to invest in data, analytics, and autonomous fleets to optimize efficiency and find the most cost-effective routes. Despite the essential services this industry provides, ground transportation companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending, for example, can greatly impact the demand for these companies’ offerings while fuel costs can influence profit margins. The 16 ground transportation stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1%. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. While some ground transportation stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 2.1% since the latest earnings results. Conducting business in over a 100 countries, Werner (NASDAQ:WERN) offers full-truckload, less-than-truckload, and intermodal delivery services. Werner reported revenues of $760.8 million, down 6.2% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 1.2%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. “While industry-wide headwinds remain, second quarter earnings improved sequentially, and we made progress on controlling the controllables. One-Way Truckload production increased for the fifth consecutive quarter. Mexico and cross-border related business is growing double-digits. Dedicated revenue per truck was up, and Logistics segment returned to positive operating income,” said Derek Leathers, Chairman and CEO.                     ",

Despite the stormy weather and Middle East anxiety, U.S. economic soundings remain robust and Federal Reserve easing expectations continue to be dialled back - sending the dollar to near two month highs in the process. With the U.S. economy estimated to be still expanding at more than 3%, markets now seeing little more than an 80% chance of another Fed rate cut next month and the whole rate futures curve has backed up some 50 basis points over the past month. That puts a notional Fed 'terminal rate' closer to 3.5% - well above the 2.9% long-term 'neutral' rate Fed policymakers indicated at their last meeting. Minutes of that meeting late Wednesday showed a \"substantial majority\" of officials supported a half-point rate cut to start the easing cycle, but there appeared to be agreement the first move would not commit the Fed to any particular pace thereafter. A stream of Fed speakers this week seem to back that up. \"Two more cuts this year, or one more cut this year, really spans the range of what is likely in my mind,\" San Francisco Fed boss Mary Daly said overnight. After a lacklustre 10-year Treasury note auction on Wednesday, 10-year yields climbed to their highest since July and both two and 10-year yields have now got a foothold back above 4%. Perhaps more concerning for the Fed is creeping market inflation expectations, with so-called 'breakeven' expectations from the 10-year inflation-protected securities markets rising to near three-month highs at 2.3% - nearly 30 basis points higher than they were a month ago. And more worryingly ahead of next month's election, the U.S. Treasury 10-year term premium, a measure of the compensation investors demand to hold long-term government debt securities, moved back into positive territory this week. That spins attention into today's critical consumer price report, where headline annual CPI inflation is expected to ease to 2.3% - its lowest in more than three years - but with 'core' inflation stickier around 3.2%. \"I continue to see a meaningful risk that inflation could get stuck above our 2% goal,\" Dallas Fed chief Lorie Logan said on Wednesday, adding that the Fed \"should not rush to reduce the fed funds target to a 'normal' or 'neutral' level\".

Most Read from Bloomberg The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? A Florida investor was quietly snapping up the company’s stock, buying so much that by Monday he disclosed owning a more than 18% stake — making him the second-biggest shareholder after Leonard Green & Partners, the Los Angeles private equity firm. The move set off alarms at The Container Store’s headquarters: On Tuesday, the company announced that it enacted a so-called poison-pill provision, a method used to ward off unwanted takeovers by making them prohibitively expensive, after the “rapid and significant accumulation” of its shares by a single stockholder. But it turns out Amit Agarwal is no would-be Carl Icahn. He’s a 41-year-old former patent litigator in St. Petersburg, Florida, who works out of the local Subway sandwich shop and likes placing big bets in the stock market and at the poker table. He’s put down $8 million wagering there’s solid potential in the financially struggling retailer — especially if a real buyout artist comes out of the woodwork. “There’s a gem inside this pile of mess and it will shine brightly enough to capture a buyer’s attention,” he said. But, he added: “I could be wrong.” The Container Store, a nationwide chain known for its closet organizers, storage shelves and container bins, has stumbled so badly that even a hobbyist like Agarwal was able to buy a big piece of it. Its stock surged during the Covid lockdowns — when amateur investors were piling into companies that were expected to benefit — only to tumble some 96% since March 2021, cutting its market value to less than $40 million. The company is now contending with a difficult combination: declining revenues, a run of losses and a pile of debt that’s maturing in 2025 and 2026. In May, the company said it hired Latham & Watkins and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to consider strategic alternatives, which typically involves soliciting takeover offers or mulling other steps to deal with financial distress. On Wall Street, the few analysts who still track the company are skeptical of its prospects: One advises selling the shares; the other two deem it a hold. None are suggesting clients buy it. In July, S&P Global Ratings downgraded The Container Store to CCC+, deep into junk grade, seeing mounting risks it will be pushed to default on its debts.                      ",

The transaction, first rumored yesterday, saw existing investors such as Singapore's sovereign wealth fund (GIC) and StepStone Group procuring additional shares in the London-based fintech. A secondary market sale essentially rewards employees for getting a company to where it is, without having to go public — or, at least, buying it more time. It has been an action-packed year for Monzo. The company raised $190 million in May, just two months after kicking off a $425 million Series I round that saw Alphabet's CapitalG and sister VC firm GV making a rare co-investment. The startup has now raised around $1.5 billion since its foundation nine years ago. At the time of its March fundraise, Monzo said its pre-money valuation was £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion), implying a post-money valuation of £4 billion ($5 billion) -- this valuation rose slightly with the second tranche that followed in May. The following month, Monzo reported its first full-year (pre-tax) profit, with its revenues more than doubling from the previous year. The company claims 20% of U.K. adults as customers as well as 6% of businesses in the country. This growth, coupled with a roadmap that includes a wider European expansion and plans to accelerate its rollout in the U.S market where it appointed a new CEO last October, has clearly been deemed sufficient for a valuation bump in the past five months. Rival U.K. neobank Revolut recently confirmed a new valuation of $45 billion via a similar secondary market sale, shortly after securing its own banking license in the U.K. and Mexico. \"It’s great to be able to provide employees with some liquidity, while meeting further investor demand for Monzo equity,\" Monzo CEO TS Anil said in a statement.

Meanwhile, with LPs snapping shut their checkbooks as their returns slow, the number of VCs and angel investors investing in a startup in the first quarter of this year fell to just 45.5% of those who were striking deals in 2021. Pressure is building. VCs are sitting on unicorns that now account for $2.5 trillion in value, says PitchBook -- and nearly 40% of these have been in their VCs’ portfolio for at least nine years.

Starboard Value said they had scheduled a meeting with CEO Albert Bourla, Shantanu Narayen, and potentially other Board members on October 16. They plan to share their perspectives and discuss Pfizer’s future direction. Also Read: Former Pfizer Executives Ian Read And Frank D’Amelio Support Albert Bourla’s Leadership Amid Starboard Activism: ‘Will Deliver Shareholder Value.’ The letter highlights recent press reports that Starboard reached out to the company’s former CEO, Ian Read, and former CFO, Frank D’Amelio, as part of their due diligence process. Both Mr. Read and Mr. D’Amelio expressed concerns regarding Pfizer’s current trajectory. As former executives and significant individual shareholders with a strong understanding of Pfizer’s stakeholders, they conveyed a shared desire for the company to pursue a more promising course and offered assistance. The letter states that interaction with the former executives has been limited to this, which aligns with publicly available information. The letter adds that individuals within Pfizer or their representatives have allegedly contacted Mr. Read and Mr. D’Amelio, threatening legal action, the recovery of prior compensation, and the cancellation of unvested performance stock units unless they publicly support the current CEO. The shareholder urges the Board to establish a special committee of impartial members to investigate the matter, determine who authorized such actions, and hold the responsible parties accountable. Concurrently, Pfizer released topline results from the final prespecified overall survival (OS) analysis of the TALAPRO-2 study of Talzenna (talazoparib) in combination with Xtandi (enzalutamide) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Results showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the final OS in all-comers (cohort 1) and in patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC (cohort 2) compared to Xtandi alone. At the time of the final analysis, the clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) was maintained in both cohorts from the prior primary analysis previously reported and published in The Lancet. The FDA approved Talzenna in combination with Xtandi for adult patients with HRR gene-mutated mCRPC in June 2023. The European Commission also approved the combination in January 2024 for adult patients with mCRPC whose chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.          ",

Polyester, described as the largest driver of this growth, has replaced cotton as the \"most widely used fibre in the world\" since the mid to late 2000s. The report noted that global fibre production per person has also increased significantly, growing from 8.3 kilograms per person in 1975 to 15.5 kilograms per person in 2023, with this figure expected to rise to 18.8 kilograms per person by 2030 if business continues as usual. Synthetic fibres dominated global fibre production in 2023, accounting for approximately 67% (84 million tonnes). Polyester led the market with a 57% share, followed by polyamide (nylon) at 5%, while other synthetic fibres combined for an additional 5%. Plant-based fibres made up about 25% of the global fibre market in 2023. Cotton was the second-most produced fibre globally, with 24.7 million tonnes, representing 20% of total fibre production. Non-cotton plant fibres, including hemp, flax, and jute, held a 5% share, contributing 6.7 million tonnes. Manmade cellulosic fibres (MMCFs) accounted for 6% of global production, totalling 7.9 million tonnes, with viscose representing 5% and other MMCFs holding a combined 1.3%. Animal fibres comprised just 1% of global production, with wool at 0.9%, and other animal fibres (beyond wool) contributing only 0.07%.

AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors. But not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street’s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities. Covering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology. So, let’s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank’s choice as the superior AI stock to buy. Meta Platforms We’ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world’s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience – at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world’s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted. Meta’s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company’s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta’s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms – as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion – a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations. Solid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world – and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.

        "body": "By Helen Reid LONDON (Reuters) - IKEA annual sales fell 5% after the Swedish budget homeware retailer cut prices in a bid to attract more shoppers and maintain its share of a shrinking home furniture market, but it expects a recovery next year. Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores globally, reported 39.6 billion euros ($43.3 billion) in sales for its financial year ended Aug. 31. \"In all our markets we experienced a slowdown of the economy and a slowdown of the home furnishing industry, almost simultaneously,\" said Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group. \"We never experienced anything like that since 2008, to be honest.\" After seeing a decline in store visits and sold quantities, IKEA decided to cut prices, which boosted footfall and the amount of products sold, Brodin said. Ingka Group said it invested more than 2.1 billion euros in price cuts across its markets, and its share of the global home furnishing market stayed steady at 5.7%. IKEA has benefited from households trading down as a global property slowdown hurt confidence, said Tolga Oncu, retail manager at Ingka Group. For 2025, IKEA expects a boost to sales as lower interest rates drive more people to move house, which usually prompts buying of beds, sofas, and bookcases. Store visits increased by 3.3% to 727 million this year, slower than the 7.4% growth seen in 2023 and new openings fell to 41, from 60. Ingka plans 58 new locations worldwide in its 2025 financial year. Its share of sales made online increased to 28%, up from 26% in 2023. NOT GOING OUT AT CHRISTMAS This holiday season, like last year, Oncu expects people to spend more time hosting at home rather than going out, with budgets still constrained by inflation. Inter IKEA Group, which owns the IKEA brand and manufactures the products, reported annual sales of 45.1 billion euros ($49.3 billion) across all franchisees, of which Ingka Group is the biggest. That was down 5.3% compared to 2023, largely due to price cuts as the cost of raw materials like wood fell. Inter IKEA CEO Jon Abrahamsson Ring said more price reductions were planned for its 2025 financial year, which started on Sept. 1, but likely not as significant.

The changes included replacing CFO Natalie Knight with China COO Doug Ostermann. The company said the changes were made to \"redouble\" its focus on key priorities and address global challenges facing the industry.  Stellantis (STLA) shares lost ground in early trading Friday after the \"Big Three\" automaker announced an executive shakeup as it tries to recover from a sales slump. The parent of the Jeep, Chrysler, and other brands said CFO Natalie Knight is leaving the company, and will be replaced by the firm’s China COO Doug Ostermann. Alfa Romeo brand CEO Jean-Philippe Imparato will also become CEO of the Enlarged Europe division, succeeding Uwe Hochgeschurtz, who is also departing. Antonio Filosa, head of South American operations, will be North America COO, succeeding Carlos Zarlenga, “whose next position will be subject to a further announcement.” Other changes included appointing Gregoire Olivier COO in China and Santo Ficili as CEO of Maserati and Alfa Romeo. Stellantis said the moves were designed “to redouble the Company’s focus on its key business priorities and confront head-on the global challenges facing the industry.” CEO Carlos Tavares called this a “Darwinian period for the automotive industry,” and said the new management team is expected to help “tackle the challenges ahead.” Stellantis has been reeling from a slowing car market, excess inventory, and Chinese competition. Last month, the automaker cut its outlook. Last week, it posted a significant drop in U.S. sales. Barclays downgraded the stock following the news, warning it sees no real recovery for Stellantis until at least the first half of next year. Shares of Stellantis were down about 3% in early trading Friday and have lost more than 40% of their value since the start of the year. TradingView Read the original article on Investopedia. ",

China-based BYD is known for producing vehicles like the budget-friendly Atto 3 electric SUV, the Dolphin electric hatchback, and the Seal battery-electric mid-size sedan, among other vehicles. In addition to cars, BYD is also active in various industries, including the production of rechargeable batteries and mobile handset components. Meanwhile, Rivian is known for the R1S electric SEUV, the R1T electric pickup truck, and its electric delivery van, the EDV. American Depository Receipt (ADR) shares of BYD have surged 23% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date return to 38% and their one-year gain to 25%. Importantly, each ADR share of BYD traded over the counter in the U.S. is worth two H shares traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In contrast, Rivian Automotive stock has plummeted 36% over the last three months, dragging its year-to-date plunge down to 55%. The stock is off 47% over the past year. The market’s opposite reactions to these two stocks may have some investors wondering if Rivian offers a buy-the-dip opportunity. However, there’s more to both stocks than it appears. Let’s take a look. BYD is strongly tied to the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets right now. As such, this stock could continue to encounter significant volatility in light of what’s happening in those stock markets. Thus, a bearish view looks appropriate. First, an understanding of BYD’s business is helpful. As already stated, the company doesn’t just sell EVs, so there is much more to consider with the Chinese automaker. Additionally, BYD offers exposure to both battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids, which is critical right now as most of the growth in the clean-energy vehicle space is in hybrids rather than BEVs. Turning to the current issues with Chinese stocks, China’s stock market has gone through significant ups and downs recently. The latest news is that China’s central bank revealed a US$70 billion financing facility to fund institutional buying, which sent the Hang Seng Index up 3% at the market close on Oct. 10. Despite some recovery, the index remains down 6.5% for the week ending Oct. 10, following an earlier drop. All eyes are now on the weekend as investors hope for even more stimulus from the People’s Bank of China. If the central bank falls short, Chinese stocks could tumble further. Conversely, if more stimulus is introduced, they could rally, potentially driving BYD’s stock higher, pushing it beyond an attractive buy price.               ",

The company garnered negative coverage in July when a flawed software update caused worldwide tech outages, but RBC said CrowdStrike is successfully moving past the incident. Delta Air Lines said it continues to seek compensation from CrowdStrike related to the incident.  Shares of cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) added more than 5% on Thursday, notching the S&P 500's top performance of the day, after RBC Capital named the company one of its top investment ideas in North American software for 2025. CrowdStrike drew scrutiny in mid-July when the firm's defective software update caused widespread technology outages across the world. Fallout from that incident sent CrowdStrike shares tumbling, and it's still below the levels seen after those events—but the stock has been on a path of recovery since printing a low in early August. According to analysts at RBC, the negative headlines about the midsummer software update and subsequent technological interruptions generated \"short-term noise\" surrounding CrowdStrike stock, but the company appears poised to emerge from the situation in a strong position. RBC believes CrowdStrike could be on track to achieve $10 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company's management team recently reiterated its goal to achieve this ambitious milestone by fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike's ARR for fiscal 2024 came in at over $3.4 billion. CrowdStrike continues to face issues stemming from the July incident. When Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported lower-than-expected sales and profits in its quarterly report released Thursday, the carrier cited the negative impact of the CrowdStrike outage, which resulted in the cancellation of thousands of flights. According to Delta, the incident caused a $380 million hit to revenue in the quarter. The airline's CEO said Delta continues to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft (MSFT) related to the outages. Following Thursday's gains, CrowdStrike shares are trading around 23% higher year-to-date but remain around 21% below the all-time highs seen this summer before the incident.

But the stock has been climbing lately, about doubling from September lows. The shares can be volatile, trading on views regarding former President Donald Trump's political fortunes as well as company news.  Shares of Truth Social's parent company jumped Thursday, rising as the company announced some product news that helped the stock touch its highest level in months. Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) stock recently was up more than 16% to around $24. The move comes as the shares have risen off lows below $12 per share touched last month. Today's move likely was spurred in part by the company's announcement that a new app for watching its streaming video offering is now available in Google's Play Store. But the stock generally has risen in recent weeks, moving off lows driven by investor questions about whether the expiration of lock-up agreements governing some investors' trades would be followed by widespread selling by former President Donald Trump, its majority owner, or other big investors. That, for the most part, hasn't happened. That extended a run of volatility that has lasted nearly as long as the stock, which hit the public markets earlier this year via a merger with a blank-check company, has been publicly traded. The shares—which trade in part on investors' read on whether Trump might be re-elected—are still well off 2024 highs near $80, though now back at levels last seen in August.

Analysts are upbeat about the next-gen Blackwell chip and Nvidia's web of enterprise partnerships. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are among the banks that have raised price targets in recent weeks. Nvidia stock is trading at record highs, but that's not deterring top Wall Street analysts from being bullish. Bank analysts have been hiking their price targets for the chip titan in recent weeks, predicting more upside even as the stock has seen a meteoric rise over the past year. Shares traded above $142 each on Monday, hitting a fresh record as investors gear up for the company's next earnings report on November 20. The stock is up 193% year-to-date. But Nvidia still has plenty of room to climb, according to forecasters. They point to signs of frenzied demand for the company's AI-enabling GPU chips and a long list of partnerships with enterprise \"hyperscalers.\" Here's what some of Wall Street's top forecasters are saying about their bullish outlook for the stock. BofA strategists raised their price target for the chipmaker to $190 from $165 per share last week, implying another 35% upside from the stock's current levels. The upside will be driven by Nvidia's competitive advantage over other chipmakers, as well as the \"generational opportunity\" in the AI market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion, analysts said in a note. \"Driven by our increased NVDA Data Center Compute outlook, we now see the AI accelerator market growing to $280bn by CY27E (and over time toward $400bn+) from just ~$45bn in CY23. AI models (demand) continue to evolve,\" the bank added. Strategists pointed to positive signs for Nvidia's future chip demand, including commentary from other tech firms and comments from CEO Jensen Huang, who described the demand for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip as \"insane.\" Nvidia, meanwhile, also has a number of \"underappreciated\" business partnerships with firms like Accenture and Microsoft, which should contribute to the upside potential. \"We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice,\" the bank said. \"NVDA's engagements span multiple verticals (e.g., Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft), and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side.\"            ",

        "body": "By Casey Hall SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's second-hand and grey markets for luxury goods are booming, as price hikes from luxury brands in a weak economy are prompting some shoppers to look for cheaper ways to buy them, deepening concerns for the likes of LVMH. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, reported a 3% fall in quarterly sales last week, undershooting estimates in its first decline in quarterly sales since the pandemic as demand in China and Japan weakened. Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo also reported a fall in quarterly revenue, hit by a slowdown in demand from China. \"The elephant in the room is that, in China, as long as price gaps (between China and other countries) exist, there is the opportunity for price sensitive consumers to go to the grey market,\" said Max Piero, CEO of luxury intelligence consultancy Re-Hub, which tracks grey market luxury purchases in China. That market, estimated to be worth $57 billion a year, has been fuelled in recent years by the rise of platforms such as DeWu, where luxury products, often sourced overseas, are sold at discounts from 20% to over 50% to prices at Chinese flagship stores. Re-Hub estimates that sales across 48 brands on DeWu rose 19% year on year in the second quarter to more than 7 billion yuan ($984.4 million). China's retail sales, a gauge of consumption, grew a subdued 3.2% in September and the weakness is a bad sign for global luxury giants as China accounts for around 25% of worldwide revenues for the sector. Growing consumer interest in both the second-hand and grey markets is adding a headache to top-end brands seeking to defend their sales in China. \"The rising prices of those luxury brands is definitely one of the reasons that more and more consumers are turning to the secondary market,\" said Yi Kejie, a 28-year-old marketing content manager and luxury consumer. SECOND-HAND OVER-SUPPLY Following the release of their third quarter sales, executives of LVMH, home to Louis Vuitton and Dior, defended their labels’ upmarket push and said they did not plan to introduce new ranges of more affordable products. They also said they had no intention of getting involved in the second-hand market, noting that the tight control their brands hold on distribution makes them less exposed to parallel markets. But China's second-hand market is also fuelled by the country's slowing economy, as more people are looking to make some cash off their luxury collections. \"The number of sellers is growing really fast, and the majority of them are selling luxury items for the first time. But for the buyer's side, it's pretty steady,\" said Zhu Tainiqi, founder of second-hand luxury goods marketplace ZZER.        ",

        "body": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock closed at a record high on Monday as Wall Street analysts held firm on their bullish positions on the stock ahead of its earnings report in November. Shares of the leading AI chipmaker rose over 4% to close at $143.71 per share. The move comes as Wall Street analysts reiterate their Buy ratings on the stock. Citing strong demand for artificial intelligence, Bank of America (BAC) on Friday raised its price target from $165 to $190 (go inside the call with analyst Vivek Arya below from the Opening Bid podcast), while investment research firm CFRA raised its price target for Nvidia last week from $139 to $160. Overall, analysts see shares rising to $148.37 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. In addition to growth in the AI market at large, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya said Nvidia’s strength in the enterprise AI space — i.e., its partnerships with companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Accenture (ACN) — is another factor contributing to his higher price target. Arya said “NVDA is the partner of choice” for enterprise AI hardware and software. Wedbush analyst and Nvidia bull Dan Ives echoed that sentiment in a note to investors Sunday, writing that there is “a tidal wave of enterprise spending as AI use cases explode,” with Nvidia leading the market. Ives forecasts the AI infrastructure market to grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies spending $1 trillion on AI capital expenditures in that time frame. “In a nutshell, we believe the stage is set for tech stocks to see another 20% move higher in 2025 with this tech bull market just hitting its next phase led by the AI Revolution,” Ives added. “In our opinion as the Fed and Powell have kicked off its aggressive rate cutting cycle, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector.” Despite a short-lived tumble last week and looming fears of an AI spending slowdown, Nvidia shares have risen nearly 3% over the past week and more than 20% in the last month. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said there is “insane” demand for its AI chips, which are used in data centers by Big Tech companies to power generative artificial intelligence software. Recent positive news from the company's industry partners has also boosted AI stocks across the board, including Nvidia. Micron (MU), which supplies memory chips used in Nvidia’s GPUs, and TSMC (TSM), which manufactures Nvidia’s AI chips, both surpassed Wall Street’s expectations in their recent earnings reports.

        "body": "It seems likely that a small group of traders (or possibly a lone individual) have pushed up former President Donald Trump’s odds on Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market, by heavily betting on the Republican nominee. There has been a good deal of handwringing about this, both from supporters of vice president and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on X (formerly Twitter) who have an obvious incentive to call the markets manipulated, and from the mainstream press. “[T]he surge might be a mirage manufactured by a group of four Polymarket accounts that have collectively pumped about $30 million of crypto into bets that Trump will win,” The Wall Street Journal speculated. Indeed, there may be a lone bettor who has gone very long on Trump. But that's not necessarily evidence of something sinister. Aubrey Strobel is a communications partner at Bitcoin app developer Trust Machines and the host of The Aubservation podcast. First, the obvious point: it’s not just Polymarket where Trump is rallying. Trump \"yes\" shares are trading at around 59.9 cents on Polymarket right now, indicating the market sees a 59.9% probability he will win. (Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.) Predictit – a U.S. platform with strict betting limits (which would in theory be immune to the Polymarket whale) – has Trump at 56%. Kalshi, a U.S.-based, regulated platform, has Trump at 58%. If you think this price action constitutes “manipulation,” you would have to wonder why Kalshi – a platform where manipulation would be reportable – is trading in line with Polymarket. The online bookies also have Trump ahead: 59% at BetOnline, 55% at Betfair, and 60% at Bovada to name a few. And Trump is also trending up in the poll aggregates, so it’s not inconceivable that his true odds of winning are also increasing. Trump’s rally in the prediction markets coincides with Harris’ rough Fox News interview and new polls show Trump trudging upward. Secondly, the fact that a single anonymous entity has made large bets is not by itself evidence of “manipulation,” as many Harris supporters are claiming. Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine flatly says: “this does not look like market manipulation: Fredi9999 is not buying sloppily with the effect of pushing up the price, but rather buying carefully, in a manner that seems designed to get him a lot of Trump contracts for his money.” The simplest possible explanation is that a trader simply thinks Trump is underpriced and is willing to bet heavily on it. The mere existence of a large buyer does not imply manipulation. The entire premise of markets is that prices compress available information by rewarding those who take risk to express their views. The identity of the traders or the distribution of trades is irrelevant; in theory, everyone has a motive to extract information from markets by betting when their belief about the fair value of an asset diverges from the market’s value. Markets don’t need to be democratic in order to be reliable. They just need the most informed participants to financially express a view. Individual traders having concentrated ownership of an asset doesn’t in any way delegitimize the price. No one questions the price of Apple stock because Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a lot of it.          ",

Netflix shares surged after the streaming giant reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales, profits, and subscriber numbers. Shares of grain processors Bunge and Archer-Daniels-Midland lost ground after an analyst said low crop prices and weak farmer sentiment weighed on the agriculture industry.  Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher on the final day of a trading week that included a series of earnings reports from key companies. After major financial firms disclosed mostly upbeat results earlier in the week, Netflix (NFLX) took the spotlight with a strong report that could be a positive signal for the tech and communications giants set to report in the coming weeks. On Friday, the S&P 500 added 0.4% to notch an all-time closing high. The Dow reversed morning losses to end the session nearly 0.1% higher, extending its streak of record closes to three. The Nasdaq was up 0.6%. Netflix shares scored the S&P 500's top daily performance, soaring 11.1% to an all-time high following the video-streaming giant's better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. Although the pace of subscriber additions slowed from the preceding quarters, 14% growth in total active subscribers was enough to edge out estimates. Analysts have indicated that the company's crackdown on password-sharing has helped boost subscriber numbers, but Netflix plans to discontinue the public release of subscriber data starting in 2025. Shares of Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) surged 10.2% after a securities filing confirmed reports that activist investor Jana Partners has acquired a stake of around 5% in the food processing company. Jana reportedly intends to encourage the maker of frozen french fries to consider the possibility of a sale as well as push for changes to its operations and capital allocation strategy.   An upbeat earnings report also helped lift shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which jumped 10% after the provider of robotic-assisted systems for minimally invasive medical procedures topped quarterly sales and profit estimates. The company disclosed an 18% uptick in the number of procedures performed using its da Vinci surgical system. In the wake of the strong results, analysts at Piper Sandler lifted their price target on Intuitive Surgical stock to $538 from $495. Agricultural stocks moved lower after Raymond James downgraded Canada-based grain processor Ag Growth International (AGGZF) to \"market perform.\" Analysts said soft crop prices and weak sentiment among farmers amounted to significant headwinds for the global agricultural industry. Shares of fellow grain handler Bunge Global (BG) dropped 6.3%, the steepest decline in the S&P 500 Friday, while peer Archer-Daniels-Midland's (ADM) shares slide 3.8%. Ag Growth International's American depositary receipts (ADRs) were down 10.7%.    ",

The firm cited valuations, extreme market concentration, and more-regular economic contractions. The stock market's decadelong golden age will soon be a thing of the past, Goldman Sachs said. A new report from the firm's portfolio-strategy research team forecast that the S&P 500 would see an annualized nominal return of 3% over the next 10 years. That would put it in the 7th percentile of performance since 1930. It would also badly lag the 13% annualized figure put up by the benchmark index over the prior decade, Goldman data showed. \"Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are towards the lower end of their typical performance distribution relative to bonds and inflation,\" the analysts wrote. As an extension of this forecast, Goldman also sees stocks struggling to outperform other assets over the next 10 years. By its calculation, the S&P 500 has about a 72% chance of trailing bonds and a 33% probability of lagging inflation through 2034. Five factors underline Goldman's lackluster outlook: First, a historically stretched stock-market valuation implies lower future returns, the bank said. Current valuations are indeed elevated, with the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio at 38 times, or in the 97th percentile. The S&P 500's CAPE ratio has averaged 22%, Goldman said. Second, market concentration is near its highest level in 100 years, Goldman said. \"When equity market concentration is high, performance of the aggregate index is strongly dictated by the prospects of a few stocks,\" the analysts wrote. These stocks include tech large caps such as Nvidia and Alphabet, whose performance has driven the S&P 500 more than 20% higher year to date. While that's led the index through a string of record highs this year, it fosters a market mired in volatility risk and in need of diversity. \"Our historical analyses show that it is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time. The same issue plagues a highly concentrated index,\" Goldman said. While some may find reason to argue why tech stocks will maintain growth momentum, history suggests that revenue will slow. Goldman said that S&P 500 firms that had consistently generated over 20% revenue growth underwent a sharp drop off after 10 years.      ",

        "body": "The Victorian Government of Australia has announced a significant stamp duty concession for off-the-plan property purchases, with an aim to construct more houses in the state of Victoria. The new change will reduce upfront costs, accelerate building projects, and enhance affordability across the board. Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan unveiled the one-year stimulus at a new apartment complex in North Fitzroy. Under the current system, first-home buyers and owner-occupiers are entitled to a stamp duty concession for off-the-plan purchases, with construction costs deductible from the sale price for tax calculations. However, the benefit is capped at a post-deduction value of A$750,000 ($501,157) for first-home buyers and A$550,000 for owner-occupiers. The new policy, designed to spur housing construction, extends the concession to all buyers of apartments, units, or townhouses off-the-plan, eliminating the previous value thresholds. Effective yesterday (21 October) for a duration of 12 months, it permits a full deduction of remaining construction and refurbishment costs when assessing stamp duty liabilities. The savings potential varies with the construction stage, but typically, an off-the-plan apartment buyer could pay roughly one-fourth of the stamp duty compared to without the latest concession. Meanwhile, a Victorian purchasing a A$620,000 apartment before construction could see stamp duty costs plummet from approximately A$32,000 to roughly A$4,000, saving nearly A$28,000. Allan said: “More apartments and townhouses getting built means more homes for young people and families to rent or buy.\" Victoria's treasurer Tim Pallas added: “This will significantly reduce upfront costs - it’s a huge win for all buyers and builders.” To qualify, the property must be part of a strata subdivision, which includes shared areas such as driveways or hallways. Non-strata properties such as house and land packages remain ineligible for the new concession, though existing concessions for first-home buyers and owner-occupiers still apply. This initiative responds to industry concerns regarding the impact of current interest rates on sales and project launches. By reducing upfront costs for a broader buyer demographic, developers can anticipate increased presale activity, fulfilling financing prerequisites more swiftly and kick-starting construction sooner. The concession complements other government efforts, including the construction of new social and affordable homes and the Suburban Rail Loop with its housing precincts. \"Victorian Government announces stamp duty cuts to boost housing market\" was originally created and published by World Construction Network, a GlobalData owned brand.

Oil Forecasts for oil consumption next year from three main forecasting groups have taken a bearish turn since July, largely driven by weakness in China. Those pared down projections have added a layer of gloom over the market that helped overshadow the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East. The International Energy Agency continued the trend last week, cutting its forecast further, with its estimate of a persistent glut next year contributing to crude’s sizable decline for the week. Oil gained Monday amid tensions in the Middle East. Hurricanes This year’s Atlantic hurricane season has logged 15 named storms so far, thanks to the appearance of Nadine and Oscar on the weekend. That’s approaching an average year, though the numbers can be deceiving: With five hurricane strikes on mainland US — including Helene and Milton that hit two weeks apart and devastated swaths of the South — may leave 2024 as one of the costliest storm seasons. The true scope of damages could take months to fully evaluate, but for context Katrina in 2005 caused $200 billion in inflation-adjusted damages and Harvey in 2017 racked up $160 billion in costs. Orange Juice Orange juice prices are up about 50% this year as drought and disease undermine output from Brazil, the world’s biggest supplier of the juice, while Florida’s citrus groves continue to dwindle. Futures reached fresh records last month, and Hurricane Milton has underpinned higher prices after the storm felled fruits and trees in the top juice-producing US state. The US Department of Agriculture had already expected Florida’s production this season to be the lowest since 1933 — but adding Milton’s impact could deal an even bigger blow to the harvest. Futures extended declines on Monday. Iron Ore The world’s two biggest suppliers of iron ore, Rio Tinto Group and Vale SA, boosted output of the steelmaking ingredient in the third quarter, even as demand from China faces headwinds due to the nation’s unresolved property crisis. Rio’s quarterly output has climbed from earlier this year, while Brazil’s Vale churned out its highest volume since late 2018, ahead of a dam-collapse disaster that triggered yearslong disruptions. The world’s top iron ore miners continue to beef up supplies, with their large-scale operations safeguarded by per-ton costs that remain far below current spot levels.            ",

U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday to cap off their sixth winning week in a row, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying to new records. For the week, the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.9%, the blue-chip Dow climbed 1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%. Source: Investing.com The week ahead is expected to be an eventful one as investors assess the outlook for the economy, inflation, interest rates and corporate earnings. Most important on the economic calendar will be Thursday morning's release of initial jobless claims figures at 8:30AM ET, as well as a pair of flash PMI surveys. That will be accompanied by a heavy slate of Fed speakers, with the likes of district governors Neel Kashkari, Lorie Logan, Mary Daly, and Patrick Harker all set to make public appearances during the week. Source: Investing.com Some 88% of market participants expect the Federal Open Market Committee to cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at its November 7 policy meeting, while nearly 12% expect no change, according to Investing.com’s Fed Monitor Tool. Meanwhile, third-quarter earnings season shifts into high gear, with reports expected from several high-profile companies, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Boeing (NYSE:BA).

Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, October 21 - Friday, October 25. I foresee a strong performance for GE Aerospace stock this week, with a potential breakout to a fresh multi-year high on the horizon. The primary catalyst for GE Aerospace is its third-quarter earnings report, set to be released before the market opens on Tuesday at 6:30AM ET. Market participants expect a sizable swing in GE stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 5.3% in either direction.

Despite experiencing some volatility in late summer, the NASDAQ index has climbed 24% year-to-date and remains on a generally upward trajectory. While industry giants like Nvidia have dominated headlines, Berenberg analyst Nay Soe Naing is turning attention toward under-the-radar names in the chip software space. To delve deeper, we’ve leveraged the TipRanks data platform to gauge Wall Street’s sentiment on two such stocks recommended by Naing. Both come with Buy ratings and promising upside potential. Let’s dive into the details, along with key insights from the Berenberg analysis. Synopsys (SNPS) The first company we’ll look at here, Synopsys, is a specialist in electronic design automation, with a focus on silicon design, the important first step in the manufacturing process for silicon semiconductor chips. The company offers solutions for silicon design and verification, silicon intellectual property, and systems verification and validation, and bases its solutions on artificial intelligence (AI) and software-defined systems. Synopsys boasts that its technology, and the tech and software solutions that it provides, make possible the innovations behind many of today’s big headline generators – autonomous vehicles, machine learnings, and high-speed communications, among others. In recent weeks, Synopsys has made announcements showing that it is both expanding and streamlining its business. On the streamlining side, the company sold off its optical solutions group to Keystone Technologies, a leader in the field of design and emulation test solutions. The terms of this deal were not disclosed. And on the expansion side, Synopsys at the end of September entered into an agreement with TSMC, the world’s second-largest chip maker by market cap and third-largest by revenue, to provide advanced EDA and IP solutions to support TSMC’s most advanced technological process and manufacturing lines. Synopsys may not be a household name, but it is big business. The company has more than 35 years’ experience, and employs over 19,000 people – and brought in over $5.8 billion in revenue for calendar-year 2023. In its most recently reported quarter, for fiscal 3Q24, the company brought in $1.526 billion at the top line, for a 13%-plus year-over-year gain and beating the forecast by $10 million. The company’s bottom line, by non-GAAP measures, came to $3.43 per share, growing 27% year-over-year and beating expectations by 14 cents per share. Synopsys followed these sound results by guiding toward 15% y/y revenue growth for fiscal 2024; achieving that would be a company record.                ",

The CIO said the market has suffered from \"invincibility syndrome.\" Grant said stocks could soon enter a period of weak returns, possibly for \"many years.\" The bull market in stocks looks like it's close to the top, according to an investment chief. Michael Grant, the co-CIO of Calamos Investments, thinks large-cap stocks could be on track for one of the best years over the last century, before the market tips into a period defined by subpar returns. That's because stocks are flashing signs of \"invincibility syndrome,\" with investors falsely believing that nothing can stop further gains, he said in a note this week. \"The most significant feature of this investment year is the perception that US equities are virtually invincible. This 'Invincibility Syndrome' historically signals a crescendo when markets are in the process of summiting a major peak,\" Grant wrote. \"In our view, the paradox of this rewarding year is its underlying warning of low future returns for 2025 and beyond,\" he later added. The precarious state of the market can be seen in a slew of data points that measure valuation, sentiment, and positioning, he noted. A handful of valuation measures suggest stocks are at historically expensive levels, Grant said. For instance, the median price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is 28, the most expensive stocks have been relative to earnings since around the dot-com bubble. Meanwhile, the standard Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio — which smooths out outlier P/E data — has climbed past 35, the highest level on record. Sentiment and position indicators are also flashing signs investors are overexcited about the stock market, Grant said. Households appear to be the most bullish on stocks since the dot-com era. The percentage of consumers who expect stock gains over the next year has climbed to its highest levels recorded since 1987, according to the three-month moving average of responses to the Conference Board's monthly survey. Households also have a lot of cash allocated to investments. US households held a record $42.43 trillion in corporate equities and mutual fund shares over the second quarter, Federal Reserve data shows. Meanwhile, the amount of cash held by non-bank investors as a percentage of equity mutual funds has dropped to nearly 30%, around historic lows. That suggests there's little \"cushion\" in the event the stock market declines or experiences a shock, Grant said.       ",

Analysts at Bradesco BBI saw similar gains. Bank of America favored Brazil over Mexico amid estimates for slowing US growth, while Banco Itau BBA forecast a banner year on the back of attractive valuations and earnings growth. Instead, Brazilian equities have been among the world’s worst performers, sending one valuation measure to the lowest among major stock indexes and near the lowest relative to the emerging-market benchmark in more than a decade. They’re trailing far behind most peers, beaten down by a government that’s blown out the budget deficit and forced policymakers into a hawkish stance to contain inflation expectations. Higher interest rates — the 10.75% benchmark is more than double the Fed’s target — are pushing investors away from stocks and into government bonds that promise double-digit returns with little risk. “Higher interest rates in Brazil are going to keep local investors on the sidelines,” said Josh Rubin, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “There’s no reason to go buy equities.” The Ibovespa has lost 2.8% this year, among the 10 worst performances in the world, but the losses are even bigger in dollar terms: a whopping 17% plunge. That’s even as the MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 15% when factoring in dividends and the S&P 500 Index returned 24%. The market dynamic is set to continue, with traders betting on at least 2 percentage points of additional rate hikes in Brazil this year even as they predict the Fed will cut at least half a point. Brazil is one of the only major central banks in the world in the midst of a hiking cycle; the vast majority of its global counterparts are reducing borrowing costs. Brazil analysts raised their 2025 year-end interest rate forecasts for the second straight week, according to a weekly central bank survey published Monday. “Stocks are very cheap and it’s been like this for a long time,” said Nikolaj Lippmann, Morgan Stanley’s chief Latin American equity strategist. “It’s probably going to remain like this until we find a way to get interest rates down.”                    ",

        "body": "Looking back on sales and marketing software stocks’ Q2 earnings, we examine this quarter’s best and worst performers, including Upland (NASDAQ:UPLD) and its peers. The Internet and the exploding amount of data have transformed how businesses interact with, market to, and transact with their customers. Personalization of offerings, e-commerce, targeted advertising and data-empowered sales teams are now table stakes for modern businesses, and sales and marketing software providers are becoming the tools of evolving customer interaction. The 23 sales and marketing software stocks we track reported a strong Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Thankfully, sales and marketing software stocks have been resilient with share prices up 8.7% on average since the latest earnings results. Founder Jack McDonald’s second software rollup, Upland Software (NASDAQ:UPLD) is a one stop shop for sales and marketing software, project management, HR, and contact center services for small and medium sized businesses. Upland reported revenues of $69.34 million, down 6.9% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.3%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a mixed quarter with revenue guidance for the next quarter falling below analysts' expectations. \"In Q2, we beat our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoints and posted Core Bookings in excess of Core Churn for the second quarter in a row,\" said Jack McDonald, Upland's chairman and chief executive officer. Upland delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 4.1% since reporting and currently trades at $2.40. Is now the time to buy Upland?

A $30 million bet on Trump has raised questions about how big bettors can swing the odds. With the presidential election less than three weeks away, polls indicate former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a virtual dead heat. But the election odds look somewhat different in the prediction markets, where people can bet money on the outcome of a race, and the constantly changing odds of a Harris or Trump win on these marketplaces are being closely watched by politicos. Since the start of October, there's been a notable divergence between the betting markets and the polls. Despite numerous polling averages showing a close race between Harris and Trump, with all major battleground states within the margin of error, the betting markets have moved decisively for Trump. Rumblings have grown that a single person or a consortium of people could be tipping the scale for Trump on the betting platform Polymarket, with a series of big bets totaling $30 million, in a bid to boost the narrative that he's a shoo-in for president. Here's what you need to know. Polymarket is a crypto-based predictions market that has become one of the most popular venues for placing online bets on upcoming elections. It was founded in 2020 and requires users to place bets via stablecoins. Stablecoins are crypto tokens pegged to a fiat currency like the dollar and rarely deviate from their value. Polymarket allows investors to bet on yes or no questions. For example: Will Donald Trump win the 2024 US presidential election? Polymarket also allows its users to \"trade\" its bets, or sell out early for profits or to cut their losses. This year, Polymarket has seen $1.75 billion worth of trading volume, according to data from The Block, with betting activity exploding on US election outcomes. In October alone, the betting market has seen $1.24 billion in trading volume. Before 2024, Polymarket's monthly trading volume rarely topped $10 million. Polymarket investors include the early Facebook backer Peter Thiel, ethereum's cofounder Vitalik Buterin, and Airbnb's cofounder Joe Gebbia. The company has raised a total of $74 million, according to data from Crunchbase. Trump has a massive lead over Harris in the betting markets. As of 11:55 a.m. on Friday, Polymarket odds showed Trump had a 60.1% chance of becoming the 47th president, compared with just 39.8% for Harris.                  ",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8%, shedding over 300 points. The Nasdaq Composite, however, rose 0.2%, fueled by Nvidia's 4% surge to an all-time high. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.18%, the highest level since July, putting pressure on rate-sensitive stocks, particularly in real estate and utilities.

Technology has been a double-edged sword in real estate services. On the one hand, internet listings are effective at disseminating information far and wide, casting a wide net for buyers and sellers to increase the chances of transactions. On the other hand, digitization in the real estate market could potentially disintermediate key players like agents who use information asymmetries to their advantage. The 14 real estate services stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 13.1% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Luckily, real estate services stocks have performed well with share prices up 13.8% on average since the latest earnings results. Founded by Expedia co-founders Lloyd Frink and Rich Barton, Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) is the leading U.S. online real estate marketplace. Zillow reported revenues of $572 million, up 13% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 6.3%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin and earnings estimates. Interestingly, the stock is up 53% since reporting and currently trades at $61.76. Is now the time to buy Zillow? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free. Founded in Toronto, Canada in 2014, The Real Brokerage (NASDAQ:REAX) is a technology-driven real estate brokerage firm combining a tech-centric model with an agent-centric philosophy. The Real Brokerage reported revenues of $340.8 million, up 83.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 28.9%. The business had an incredible quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings estimates. The Real Brokerage scored the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 5.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $5.16.                ",

        "body": "According to GlobalData's ‘Apparel Country Snapshot: Türkiye’ report, the value and luxury segment are both set to outperform the Turkish apparel market from 2023 to 2028. Value's share is forecast to rise by 7.1ppts to 31.6%, with a CAGR of 34.6%, driven by consumers seeking affordable options from players such as fast fashion giant Shein and sports and athleisure wear brand Decathlon amid economic pressures. However, the luxury segment is also expected to see its share rise from 5.2% to 6%, at a CAGR of 31.4%, as luxury shoppers remain relatively immune to financial pressures. The report explained that this market polarisation is projected to cause the premium and mass market segments to lose share. Premium's share is forecast to decline a significant 6.9ppts to 16.4% between 2023 and 2028, with a CAGR of 19.3%, reflecting consumers' shit towards either more affordable or more exclusive offerings. Meanwhile, the mass market will see its share slightly decline by 1.1ppts to 46% by 2028, with its CAGR standing at 27.3%, however, it will remain the \"largest\" segment due to the board appeal of these players. The report further revealed that in 2023, the sportswear market rose by 59.6% to reach ₺133.6bn ($3.90bn), marginally underperforming the growth of the wider apparel industry. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30.0% from 2023 to 2028, increasing its share of the total apparel market by 1.4ppts to 17.5%, fueled by a rising interest in fitness and the ongoing popularity of casual, versatile fashion. GlobalData pointed out that global brands like Nike and Adidas are driving this with their strong market presence and targeted marketing strategies, while local players such as Lescon are also gaining traction. On the other hand, resale apparel in Türkiye experienced a robust CAGR of 62.1% between 2018 and 2023, driven by consumers' growing interest in sustainability and affordability. Although GlobalData believes the market has slowed as it has become more developed, it continues to show strong growth, with a projected CAGR of 31.2% from 2023 to 2027. This surge is said to be largely fueled by online platforms, with major players like Dolap, Vestiaire Collective and Letgo gaining share, as consumers increasingly turn to them due to their wide accessibility Another report by GlobalData published recently, unveiled that footwear is set to drive market growth in Türkiye from 2023 to 2028, fuelled by growing demand for a wider range of styles. \"In data: Value, luxury, sportswear set to drive Turkish apparel market\" was originally created and published by Just Style, a GlobalData owned brand.

Revenue beat Bloomberg consensus estimates of $9.78 billion to hit $9.83 billion in Q3, Netflix reported after the market close on Thursday, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. The growth came as the streamer continued to lean on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to last year's price hikes on certain subscription plans. Netflix guided to fourth quarter revenue of $10.13 billion, a beat compared to consensus estimates of $10.01 billion. For full-year 2025, the company sees revenue hitting between $43 billion and $44 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $43.4 billion. This would represent growth of 11% to 13% from the company's expected 2024 revenue guidance of $38.9 billion. It expects full-year operating margins to hit 27%, an increase from the previous 26%, after the metric hit nearly 30% in the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) also beat estimates in the quarter, with the company reporting EPS of $5.40, above consensus expectations of $5.16 and well ahead of the $3.73 EPS figure it reported in the year-ago period. Netflix guided to fourth quarter EPS of $4.23, ahead of consensus calls for $3.90. Subscribers also came in strong with another 5 million-plus subscribers added on the heels of breakout programming like \"The Perfect Couple\" and \"Nobody Wants This.\" Subscriber additions of 5.07 million beat expectations of 4.5 million and follows the 8.05 million net additions the streamer added in the second quarter. The company had added 8.8 million paying users in Q3 2023. \"We expect paid net additions to be higher in Q4 than in Q3’24 due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate,\" the company said, citing upcoming releases like \"Squid Game\" Season 2, the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. Investors have praised the company's foray into sports and live events. Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction, accounting for over 50% of sign-ups in the countries where it's offered during the third quarter. \"We continue to build our advertising business and improve our offering for advertisers,\" the company said in the earnings release. \"Ads membership was up 35% quarter on quarter, and our ad tech platform is on track to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025.\"              ",

        "body": "Netflix shares powered higher into the close of Friday trading, notching their biggest single-day gain in a year, following a solid set of third quarter earnings and a host of Wall Street price target changes for streaming media giant. Netflix  (NFLX) , which along with Alphabet-owned  (GOOGL)  YouTube produces more streaming minutes than all their major competitors combined, is looking to grow its share of revenue from ad-supported tiers on its platform following its crackdown on password sharing last year. The move was designed to keep viewers from leaving to other platforms by offering cheaper alternatives to Netflix's ad-free offering and has enabled the group to continue adding paid subscribers while opening a new revenue stream from advertising markets worldwide. The pace of those subscriber gains is slowing, however, and Netflix has said that starting next year it will no longer publish details of the additions starting from next year. That leaves investors to focus on revenue growth in its ad-supported tiers and on profit margins tied to its broader platform sales and the money it spends on new content and technologies. Future Publishing/Getty Images That said, Netflix still added around 5.1 million new subscribers over the three months ended in October, a tally topped Wall Street's 4 million consensus forecast and included around 2.5 million people opting for the ad-free tier where it was available. The Los Gatos, Calif., group also beat Wall Street's profit forecast with a bottom line of $5.40 a share and posted stronger-than-expected third quarter revenues of $9.83 billion, a 15.1% increase from the same period last year. Adding to the bullish thesis, Netflix also said subscriber gains over the final three months of the year would grow even faster than they did over the third quarter, thanks in part to new live sports offerings and the return of the hit South Korea-made drama 'Squid Game.' \"We are in the subscription and entertainment business. And you can see in our results it's a pretty good business, and it appeals to a very large segment of consumers and fans,\" Co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on a conference call late Thursday. \"Our top 10 films that premier on Netflix all have over 100 million views, among the most-watched films in the world,\" he added. Related: Netflix hints at when subscriber rates may rise What the group didn't deliver, however, was a change in the pricing of either its ad-supported tier, which starts at $6.99 in the U.S, or its main ad-free platform, which costs $15.49 per month.

The Mexican peso weakened, extending its worst weekly plunge since August. The gains chipped away at an otherwise rough week for developing-world currencies. But strategists are warning the relief may be short-lived. A flurry of factors that propelled the greenback still loom, including the prospect of Donald Trump’s return to the White House, data that points to a resilient US economy and lackluster China stimulus measures. “There will likely be a broad aversion towards EM given Trump risks, but some currencies may enjoy offsetting factors that allow them to outperform” said Juan Manuel Herrera Betancourt, a strategist at Scotiabank in London. “Were optimism around Chinese stimulus to improve, we would likely see a boost from metals prices to the Peruvian sol and Chilean peso.” One-month implied volatility for emerging-market currencies rose for a fourth week, the longest streak since August. Citigroup strategists including Luis Costa said emerging currencies could become more vulnerable around the time of the election, particularly as rate cuts in many emerging markets have eroded their real yield cushion against developed-market peers. Latin American currencies, which had been some of investors’ favorite to pick up higher yields, were hit particularly hard this week. Even as prices of iron ore and copper recovered Friday following China’s central bank announcement, currencies from Brazil and Chile sank more than their peers. The Brazilian real traded at the lowest level in over two months versus the dollar as traders brush off government plans to contain fiscal spending. Chile’s peso, meantime, continued its free-fall, despite higher copper prices, after the central bank cut rates and signaled further reductions to come as the economy struggles to gain traction. The Mexican peso, meantime, sank 3.1% this week, the worst performance since August. It briefly weakened past the 20-per-dollar level Thursday, and ended the Friday session just shy of that at 19.88.               ",

Analysts were predicting Netflix would add 4.52 million subscribers. The shares surged 11% to $763.89 on Friday in New York, the biggest gain in a year. The stock has more than quadrupled since May 2022, when a slowdown in the company’s growth led to a major selloff and spooked investors about the entertainment business. Since then, Netflix has added more than 60 million customers, thanks to a crackdown on password sharing and the introduction of a lower-priced subscription with advertising. The company finished the quarter with 282.7 million subscribers. “We’re feeling really good about the business,” Co-Chief Executive Officer Ted Sarandos said on a call with analysts. “We had a plan to re-accelerate growth and we delivered on that plan.” Most analysts believe the boost from the password crackdown is temporary, and that Netflix will soon need to find another way to grow. The company has yet to see material financial returns from its investment in advertising or video games, and some on Wall Street now worry the stock is overvalued. Subscriber growth “does seem like it’s slowing back down,” according to Dave Heger, an analyst with Edward Jones. Yet Netflix continues to deliver stronger growth than expected, and its leadership has sought to reassure investors by saying the company will benefit from the crackdown on password sharing in the years ahead. The company on Thursday predicted sales next year will increase between 11% to 13% — to as much as $44 billion — through a mix of new members and price increases. Netflix will increase prices in Spain and Italy on Friday, and said it will phase out one of its cheaper-priced plans in Brazil later this quarter. Two regions — Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the Asia-Pacific — accounted for almost all of the company’s new customers. Netflix lost customers in Latin America for the first time since early 2023. New subscribers in the current, fourth quarter will exceed the third-quarter total, the company also said.

        "body": "By Nora Eckert DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors continued to defy Wall Street's expectations this year, posting third-quarter results ahead of analyst projections on the back of steady gasoline-engine truck and SUV sales and a focus on keeping inventories lean. GM is targeting annual earnings at the top end of its previous forecast, and Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson brushed off economic concerns for customers. “The consumer has held up remarkably well for us,” he told reporters, adding that interest rate cuts would further improve demand next year. GM started the year expecting to make $12 billion to $14 billion in pretax profit and raised the forecast in midyear to $13 billion to $15 billion, buoyed by strong pricing and consumer spending. On Tuesday, it said it was on track to deliver between $14 billion and $15 billion in pretax profit. GM's adjusted earnings per share were $2.96 for the quarter, outpacing analysts’ forecast of $2.43 per share. Revenue for the three-month period was $48.8 billion, beating Wall Street’s expectation of $44.6 billion. CEO Mary Barra has been focusing on a message of stability, saying earlier this month that the automaker's profit next year is expected to look similar to this year, a relief for investors who are worried about a potential decline in the auto industry's earnings. GM has said pricing could be softer next year but it expects results to be supported by costs cuts on SUVs and EVs and improvement in China. A weak spot in otherwise strong earnings was China, where operations regressed from a powerhouse to a loss of $210 million in the first half of this year. GM lost another $137 million in the region during the third quarter, and it is planning a restructuring of operations there. \"We really haven't instituted any of the real restructuring yet,\" Jacobson said, adding that sales in the region are up and inventory down. Investor concerns persist that historically high interest rates and economic fears will catch up with consumers and dampen sales of new cars, despite the resilience seen for much of the year. Shareholders are also queasy about automakers’ EV losses as Chinese rivals pump out affordable electric vehicles abroad and Tesla continues to dominate battery-powered vehicle sales in the U.S. While Chinese automakers have not yet penetrated the U.S., large automakers like GM see a threat from low-cost and high-tech vehicles, executives have said. GM's stock is up 36% year-to-date, outpacing rivals Stellantis and Ford Motor, whose shares have both decreased over the same period. Ford has struggled with costly quality problems and Stellantis with decreasing sales and revenue in North America after it raised prices and held back on incentives.     ",

But it's been swapped with a different bullish sentiment, one we all know very well: the strength of a hot economy, which has helped power the market all year — until that cut. While inflation and economic reacceleration concerns have returned after a string of hot data (the September jobs report, the Consumer Price Index, hot retail sales, and calmer weekly jobless claims), the strength has done nothing if not buoy the market. It has done just fine (thank you very much) under the past few years of high interest rates and endless no-landing comments. A hot economy is good for stocks. All this has kept the S&P 500 floating around its all-time high all week, now well over 5,800, as the index passes more and more year-end forecasts — and their subsequent upward revisions, like UBS's 5,850 figure that it published Tuesday. The mood feels different than a month ago. But as our Chart of the Week shows, not a whole lot has actually changed in terms of expectations — especially to the downside. The latest Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey shows the soft landing potential may have slightly decreased. But the hard landing respondents faded just as much, falling into the single digits for the first time since June, with just 8% seeing a recession in the next 12 months. Checking in with the CME's FedWatch tool also shows little change. The belief that the Fed will continue to cut interest rates in November is still overwhelming, with the tool showing a 91% chance of a 25 basis point cut on Friday. Reconciling these two things — another potentially reaccelerating economy and a rate cut the market is almost certain of — sounds tough. But it's not when you remember how high rates still are, as we wrote earlier this week in Chart of the Day. As Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said this week, rates are still \"overall restrictive.\" Jason Furman, the former Council of Economic Advisers Chairman under President Barack Obama, told Yahoo Finance that he sees inflation as a bigger problem than recession right now. But the current Harvard professor mused that while \"the Fed needs to have tight policy, it just doesn't need to have policy being as tight as it was last year.\"     ",

The lawsuit is the latest salvo in a bitter ongoing battle between publishers and tech companies over how the latter may use copyrighted content without authorization to build and operate their AI systems. \"This suit is brought by news publishers who seek redress for Perplexity's brazen scheme to compete for readers while simultaneously freeriding on the valuable content the publishers produce,\" according to the lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York by Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones and the NY Post. Perplexity did not immediately respond to emails from Reuters seeking comment. The AI company is among the leading startups attempting to uproot the search engine market dominated by Alphabet’s Google. It assembles information from webpages it deems to be authoritative, then provides a summary directly within Perplexity’s own tool. Perplexity uses a variety of large language models (LLMs) to generate its summaries, from OpenAI to Meta's open-source model Llama. It provides citations in those results, though Perplexity's own marketing promotes the notion that its interface enables users to “skip the links.” Google likewise now shows AI-generated summaries similar to those offered by Perplexity, though most publishers grudgingly accept that arrangement because opting out would also mean having their content removed from Google's search results, which would render them virtually invisible online. The news publishers seek to differentiate Perplexity from search engines, which they argue allow for the discovery of their work, not a substitution for it, according to the lawsuit. In the suit, the News Corp-owned publishers say their journalists investigate and write stories under tight deadlines and unpredictable circumstances. There is high demand for high-quality news presented in a timely, digestible format, and these publications rely on the sale of advertising and subscriptions to underwrite the cost of journalism, they argue. The news organizations allege Perplexity’s AI-generated “answer machine” has ingested its copyrighted news stories, analysis and opinion in an internal database used to generate responses to users’ questions. In its quest to provide answers, Perplexity copied \"vast\" quantities of the publishers' work into a database, which uses an AI technique known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide answers to users' queries, the suit alleges.

Moller-Maersk said on Monday it had raised its full-year forecasts on the back of strong third quarter results, robust demand and the continuing disruption to shipping in the Red Sea. Maersk said it had revised its outlook for global container market volume growth in 2024 to around 6% from a range of between 4% to 6% seen previously. Maersk reported preliminary underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $4.8 billion for the third quarter. Analysts had forecast EBITDA of $3.7 billion for the period, according to LSEG data. Revenue was $15.8 billion, beating the $14.4 billion forecast by analysts. Attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Iran-aligned Houthi militants have disrupted a shipping route vital to east-west trade, with prolonged re-routing of shipments pushing freight rates higher and causing congestion in Asian and European ports. Maersk now expects full-year underlying EBITDA of between $11.0 billion and $11.5 billion, up from a previous range of $9 billion to $11 billion, the group said. Earnings before interest and tax for 2024 were meanwhile seen at between $5.2 billion and $5.7 billion, up from $3 billion to $5 billion earlier.

        "body": "Netflix (NFLX) stock closed at a record high just above $772 on Monday as the streamer continued to ride positive momentum from its better-than-expected quarterly results last week. Netflix beat across every major financial metric in its third quarter results last week and projected sales for the current quarter that came in ahead of Wall Street's expectations. On Friday, the streaming giant notched a previous record close of just below $764. \"In our view, Netflix remains one of the best positioned companies within media and has several growth drivers,\" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note following the report, citing the company's booming advertising tier, along with its initiatives in gaming, sports, and live events. The analyst reiterated her Buy rating on shares and raised her price target to $800 from the prior $740. But with the stock up nearly 60% since the start of the year, its high valuation has caused some concerns. Investors have rewarded Netflix for diversifying its revenue streams, with its ad tier now accounting for over 50% of sign-ups in the countries where it's offered. The company's top-line growth has not only benefited from ads but also from the streamer's crackdown on password sharing, which analysts say is almost complete. The completion of the crackdown should lead to fewer subscribers compared to previous quarters, with future price hikes likely to offset the slowdown. \"Revenue growth in 2025 and beyond should continue to be a function of slower subscriber growth and a return to a more normal pricing cadence as the company has largely made its way through the [password-sharing crackdown],\" Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft said on Friday. Wall Street analysts have noted a price hike would be a positive catalyst for the stock in the near term, citing the company's pricing power relative to competitors. \"Given Netflix’s low cost per viewed hour, we see scope for the firm to raise US prices by 12% in 2025,\" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said in a note ahead of the report. Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the company will continue to \"evolve\" the pricing of its tiers, but that it \"love[s] the low price point and increased accessibility that comes with our ad plan,\" which costs $6.99 in the US. Still, Netflix recently revealed year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices. \"With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a note to clients following the report. \"Netflix’s stock is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025.\" Last week, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% to 13% in 2025.

Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Volatility is elevated for options on stocks, bonds and currencies alike as investors pay up for protection. The risks are clear: a hotly contested US election, interest-rate decisions in the US and Europe, the threat of a wider Middle East conflict and quarterly earnings. In the stock market, implied volatility is outpacing actual swings, and puts protecting against a selloff are favored over bullish calls. “The buyside has been forced to over-hedge by risk management for a bunch of events occurring simultaneously,” Nomura cross-asset strategist Charlie McElligott said last week. “Investors everywhere are obsessing and fixated upon ‘Worst-Case Scenario’ left-tails.” Statistically, the market always performed well when said over-hedging occurs, with stocks on median up 13% a year later, he added. With the volatility shock from early August still fresh despite indexes reaching record highs, market players haven’t returned to the level of calm seen in the first half of the year, when hedging was shunned as a drag on performance. Trading has overall been muted, and some investors have even pulled back: Open interest in futures for the Nasdaq 100 Index sank by $5.7 billion notional value in one day last week. Yet if the market gets past the gauntlet of the November events with ripples rather than a tsunami, traders might find themselves with too much protection and too little exposure, leading to yet another episode of chasing a rally as it unfolds. The underperformance of hedged portfolios is already playing out: Since Aug. 5, the Invesco S&P 500 Downside Hedge ETF is down 1.1%, compared with a total return of 13% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. When the protection is unwound or just expires, dealers on the other side needing to adjust their trading books will add to the buying. While the Cboe Volatility Index and other measures of options costs remain elevated, one-month S&P 500 realized volatility has fallen by more than half since mid-August to near a three-month low. The lower readings, especially as the wild swings from early August drop out of the calculations, are poised to bring systematic investors back into the market, creating another tailwind. That group alone could buy some $160 billion in stocks over the next three months, according to Nomura estimates.               ",

        "body": "Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang, two of tech’s wealthiest and most famous executives, saw their net worth grow this year by more than anyone else's on the planet. The net worth of Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, increased by $76.5 billion so far this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. Just behind Huang was Facebook cofounder and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth rose by $76 billion in 2024. That is equal to or exceeds the entire market cap of some companies, such as fellow tech juggernaut Spotify and the spirits maker Diageo, which both have a market cap of $76 billion, as well as CVS ($73 billion), Target ($70 billion), and Capital One ($60 billion). Zuckerberg and Huang are now the third and 11th richest people in the world, respectively. Zuckerberg, who is behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder and executive chair Jeff Bezos on Bloomberg’s rich list, has a total net worth of $204 billion, while Huang is worth $121 billion. Both Zuckerberg and Huang benefited tremendously from the standout stock performance of the companies they helm. Since the start of the year, Nvidia’s share price has surged 192% and Meta’s went up 65%. Both Meta and Nvidia are part of the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap tech stocks that have powered much of the past year’s market rally. Investors have rewarded both companies for their solidified market positions—Meta in digital advertising and Nvidia in chip manufacturing—along with their AI-focused innovation pipelines and the steady leadership provided by their executives. The two executives control substantiation portions of their companies’ shares. Zuckerberg owns about 13.5% of Meta stock, amounting to about 345 million shares. Meanwhile, Huang owns between 3.5% to 4% of Nvidia, totalling about 861 million shares. Nvidia’s stock underwent a 10-to-one stock split in July. Earlier this year, Huang announced his intention to sell up to 6 million shares by the first quarter of 2025. To do so, Huang adopted a prearranged plan meant to avoid spooking investors and finished selling the 6 million shares in September, ahead of the 2025 date he had previously announced, according to regulatory filings.

        "body": "Wrapping up Q2 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the engineered components and systems stocks, including Park-Ohio (NASDAQ:PKOH) and its peers. Engineered components and systems companies possess technical know-how in sometimes narrow areas such as metal forming or intelligent robotics. Lately, automation and connected equipment collecting analyzable data have been trending, creating new demand. On the other hand, like the broader industrials sector, engineered components and systems companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies’ offerings. The 13 engineered components and systems stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.9% below. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Thankfully, engineered components and systems stocks have been resilient with share prices up 9.8% on average since the latest earnings results. Based in Cleveland, Park-Ohio (NASDAQ:PKOH) provides supply chain management services, capital equipment, and manufactured components. Park-Ohio reported revenues of $432.6 million, up 1.1% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with some shareholders anticipating a better outcome. “We are proud to have delivered record revenue results and improved profitability during the second quarter. We achieved these results against a stable but mixed revenue backdrop, with particular strength coming from our aerospace and defense market as well as benefiting from significant backlogs in some of our long cycle businesses. While we expect mixed demand in global industrial markets to continue, our diversification and improved cost structure will help us achieve year-over-year revenue growth with improved profitability and free cash flow through the business cycle,\" said Matthew V.

Let’s take a look at how APi (NYSE:APG) and the rest of the construction and maintenance services stocks fared in Q2. Construction and maintenance services companies not only boast technical know-how in specialized areas but also may hold special licenses and permits. Those who work in more regulated areas can enjoy more predictable revenue streams - for example, fire escapes need to be inspected every five years–. More recently, services to address energy efficiency and labor availability are also creating incremental demand. But like the broader industrials sector, construction and maintenance services companies are at the whim of economic cycles as external factors like interest rates can greatly impact the new construction that drives incremental demand for these companies’ offerings. The 13 construction and maintenance services stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Luckily, construction and maintenance services stocks have performed well with share prices up 14.2% on average since the latest earnings results. Started in 1926 as an insulation contractor, APi (NYSE:APG) provides life safety solutions and specialty services for buildings and infrastructure. APi reported revenues of $1.73 billion, down 2.3% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 3.3%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin estimates but a miss of analysts’ organic revenue estimates. Russ Becker, APi’s President and Chief Executive Officer stated: “APi delivered strong financial results in the second quarter and the first half of the year. The business continues to perform well, with double digit U.S. Life Safety inspection growth, record adjusted EBITDA margin, and record free cash flow generation. I believe our leaders’ can generate continued momentum in the business, build on historically strong execution, consistently drive margin expansion, and return to historical levels of organic growth in the back half of the year and into 2025. We believe we can create sustainable shareholder value by focusing on our long-term value creation targets and we feel confident in our ability to achieve our 13% or more adjusted EBITDA margin target in 2025. \"                     ",

That compares with 13% in the last decade, and a long-term average of 11%. They also see a roughly 72% chance that the benchmark index will trail Treasury bonds, and a 33% likelihood they’ll lag inflation through 2034. “Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are toward the lower end of their typical performance distribution,” the team wrote in a note dated Oct. 18. US equities have rallied following the global financial crisis, first driven by near-zero interest rates and later by bets on resilient economic growth. The S&P 500 is on track to outperform the rest of the world in eight of the last 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, this year’s 23% bounce has been concentrated in a handful of the biggest technology stocks. The Goldman strategists said they expect returns to broaden out and the equal-weighted S&P 500 to outperform the market cap-weighted benchmark in the next decade. Even if the rally were to remain concentrated, the S&P 500 would post below-average returns of about 7%, they said. The latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey showed investors expect the US equity rally to extend into the final stretch of 2024.

The implications of the new Medicare payout levels, in fact, prompted the Louisville-based group to file a lawsuit in federal court last week, accusing the government of being “arbitrary and capricious” in calculating its reimbursements for the country's second-largest Medicare Advantage provider behind UnitedHealth  (UNH) .

Related: Humana hit by troubling Medicare Advantage change The payments, which reimburse insurers for treatments of U.S. patients over age 65, will be effectively lower than current levels when adjusted for costs and inflation. UnitedHealth shares fell more than 5% last week after it reported a big jump in its medical-cost ratio, a gauge of the amount the group is collecting from premiums against the payouts it needs to make to customers, and issued a muted 2025 profit forecast. CVSHealth  (CVS) , meanwhile, slumped nearly 10% after it slashed its full-year profit forecast in May and posted a near 6 percentage-point surge in the benefit-expense ratio at Aetna, its health insurance unit. To arrest that rise and boost sales and profits at its retail pharmacy division, CVS said Friday that it had replaced CEO Karen Lynch, who was appointed in 2021, with CVS Caremark President David Joyner.

Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares jumped nearly 40% in premarket trading Monday as markets reacted to a late-Friday filing that saw the discount carrier say it has extended the deadline on a debt refinancing plan with credit card processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). The deadline for the refinancing originally was extended from September to Monday, but Spirit said in the filing that the deadline has been extended again to Dec. 23. The company said it \"remains in active and constructive discussions with holders of its senior secured notes due 2025 and convertible senior notes due 2026 with respect to their respective maturities.\" Spirit also said it has borrowed the entire $300 million available from a revolving credit line, and expects to end the year with at least $1 billion in liquidity.

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks edged back from their all-time highs Monday as some of the steam came out of Wall Street’s long, record-breaking rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, coming off a sixth straight winning week, its longest such streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 344 points, or 0.8%, from its own record that was likewise set on Friday, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. Trading was mixed in markets around the world. Crude oil prices rose to regain some of last week’s sharp losses, while U.S. Treasury yields climbed and stock indexes mostly fell in Europe after finishing mixed in Asia. The rise in yields helped knock down stocks that tend to get hurt by higher interest rates, such as big dividend payers and businesses in the housing industry. Real-estate stocks fell to the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 index, while homebuilders Lennar and D.R. Horton both fell at least 4.3%. Home Depot’s 2.1% drop was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. The declines mean at least a pause in Wall Street’s rally to records, which was built in large part on optimism that the U.S. economy can make a perfect escape from the worst inflation in generations, one that ends without a painful recession that many investors had worried could be inevitable. With the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, the expectation among optimists is that stocks can rise even further. But critics are warning that stock prices look too expensive given how much faster they’ve climbed than corporate profits. That puts pressure on companies to deliver growth in profits to justify their stock prices, and more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to give details this week about their performances during the summer. That includes such heavyweights as AT&T, Coca-Cola, IBM, General Motors and Tesla. Tesla slipped 0.8% ahead of its report. Its stock has been shaky recently, including a tumble after an update on its highly anticipated robotaxi included fewer details than investors were hoping for. Boeing is reporting its latest results on Wednesday. It rose 3.1% after reaching an agreement with the union representing its striking machinists on a contract proposal. The union’s members could vote Wednesday on the deal, which could end a costly walkout that has crippled production of airplanes for more than a month. Spirit Airlines soared 53.1% after the carrier was able to extend a credit-card processing agreement. Coming into the day, the airline’s stock had lost 91% in the year so far following the cancellation of its planned merger with JetBlue.           ",

        "body": "“Bear” and “bull” are two terms used to describe different parts of the market cycle, and they can tell investors a lot about what’s going on in the economy. A bear market is a prolonged decline in stock prices. A bull market is a prolonged rise in prices. Understanding what a bull market looks like compared to a bear market can be helpful when it comes to making informed investment decisions. Here’s a breakdown of what each type of market entails, how bull and bear markets work, and how to invest during both. A bull market is the opposite of a bear market and occurs when asset prices rise significantly over a long period of time, commonly defined as a 20% or more increase from their most recent low. A bull market can also refer to a price spike in a specific market. Bull markets typically happen alongside a growing or strong economy, a solid gross domestic product (GDP), rising corporate profits that lift stock prices, and lower unemployment. In the same way a bear market can shake investor confidence, a bull market can boost investor confidence, thus driving returns higher too. Bull markets tend to be longer than bear markets, lasting an average of five years. Over the years, the stock market has seen many bull runs, which happen on average every six years. The longest bull market to date started in March 2009 and ran through February 2020. The S&P 500 has had 13 bull markets since 1946. There isn’t a hard-and-fast rule, but some analysts describe a bear market as a decline of 20% or more off recent highs in the market across a broad range of asset classes. A bear market might also be confined to an asset class. Bear markets tend to occur before an economic downturn and may signal a recession. Some notable bear markets include the Great Depression, the dot-com bubble, the Great Recession and as the pandemic started in February 2020, which is one of the shortest bear markets at 33 days. Bear markets can be caused by a slowing or sluggish economy, high inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical instability, substantial shifts in the economy and other factors that impact investor sentiment and create uncertainty. Bear markets tend to be shorter than bull markets, lasting about 10 to 12 months on average in the S&P 500. There have been 13 bear markets in the S&P 500 since 1946, an average of one every six years. It can be helpful to think of bull and bear markets as generally opposites to one another, but here’s a side-by-side look at what each type entails.                              ",

You Would Be Surprised “When Trump was elected, expectations were that technology would underperform and financials and energy would outperform,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments. “The exact opposite was true.” That isn’t stopping investors from trying to get an edge. Here are some of the ways they are trying to profit from—or hedge against—the outcome. Betting markets that let people wager on election outcomes aren’t new. A recent court ruling legalized them in the U.S. Prediction markets such as Kalshi and Interactive Brokers’ ForecastEx let investors purchase contracts that pay out about $1 if a chosen candidate wins, or nothing if the bet is wrong. Contract prices fluctuate based on demand and the perceived odds of a candidate’s winning. Some prediction markets have shifted sharply in favor of former President Donald Trump since the beginning of October, when they showed the presidential race was nearly deadlocked. On Polymarket, a platform that isn’t open to Americans, a contract that pays out if Trump wins cost around 60 cents on Friday, compared with 40 cents for Vice President Kamala Harris. In theory, betting markets offer a real-time look at election-outcome expectations, with real money on the line. But a recent flurry of wagers among four big accounts on Polymarket are raising questions about who is behind them. The latest polls show the two candidates are nearly deadlocked in the key swing states that will decide the election. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, the Trump-backed parent company of Truth Social, have been a volatile playground for traders who are trying to predict the outcome of the race. Often referred to by the ticker DJT, the company’s nearly $6 billion market value belies its fundamentals, which include less than $2 million in reported revenue in the most recent quarter. DJT has achieved meme-stock status, attracting day traders, and its performance has often been tied to Trump’s perceived election chances.                      ",

        "body": "Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) will release earnings results for its third quarter, before the opening bell on Tuesday, Oct. 22, Analysts expect the New York-based company to report quarterly earnings at $1.18 per share. That’s up from $1.11 per share in the year-ago period. Verizon projects to report revenue of $33.43 billion for the recent quarter, compared to $30.48 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. United States Cellular Corporation (NYSE:USM) recently agreed to sell part of its retained spectrum licenses to Verizon for $1 billion. With the recent buzz around Verizon, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Verizon offers an annual dividend yield of 6.16%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 67.75 cents per share ($2.71 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Verizon, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Verizon $2.71 dividend: $6,000 / $2.71 = 2,214 shares So, an investor would need to own approximately $97,394 worth of Verizon, or 2,214 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.71 = 443 shares, or $19,488 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. View more earnings on VZ Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. VZ Price Action: Shares of Verizon gained by 0.3% to close at $43.99 on Friday.

Let’s take a look at how electrical systems stocks fared in Q2, starting with OSI Systems (NASDAQ:OSIS). Like many equipment and component manufacturers, electrical systems companies are buoyed by secular trends such as connectivity and industrial automation. More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products. The 14 electrical systems stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Luckily, electrical systems stocks have performed well with share prices up 10.8% on average since the latest earnings results. With a name reflecting its initial focus on optical sensors, OSI Systems (NASDAQ:OSIS) is a designer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems and components. OSI Systems reported revenues of $480.9 million, up 16.8% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.9%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ Security revenue estimates and full-year revenue guidance exceeding analysts’ expectations. Deepak Chopra, OSI Systems’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter financial results as outstanding performance in the Security division led to record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share. Fiscal 2024 was a great success for the Company. With a backlog near all-time highs and visibility into a robust pipeline of opportunities, we believe we are well positioned for a strong fiscal 2025.” OSI Systems delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 3.7% since reporting and currently trades at $150.03.                    ",

In fact, JPMorgan predicted the S&P 500 would drop sharply this year. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley expected an average year with returns in the single digits, not a repeat of double-digit gains. Fast forward to today, and the S&P 500 is already up 23% so far in 2024, nearly matching last year's advance. That's despite the Fed beginning its rate-cutting cycle later than hoped and with fewer cuts anticipated for the year. Instead of being fueled by Fed rate cuts, the stock market rally has had other catalysts: the economy has continued to defy expectations with its robustness, corporate earnings have come in strong, and the AI boom still has legs. In recent weeks, Wall Street has been warming up to the idea of another big gain. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said the S&P 500 would hit 6,000 by the end of the year and 6,300 a year from now. That was up from Goldman’s earlier predictions that the S&P 500 would reach 5,600 by year’s end and 6,000 over the next 12 months. If the broad stock market index hits that target, it would represent an increase of 26% for the year. Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, has been saying for months that the S&P 500 would end the year at 6,000. That assumes the U.S. election produces a divided government, which is more likely to lead to stable regulatory policy and lower government spending, he reiterated in a recent note. And on Friday, Sandra Cho, founder and president of Pointwealth Capital Management, told CNBC that she sees the S&P 500 finishing the year at about 6,000. \"We're in the soft-landing camp,\" she said. \"We definitely feel like the Fed has done a pretty good job. There's been a couple of hiccups, but [it] has done a pretty good job as far as factoring in inflation and managing what's going on, especially with the geopolitical events happening.\" Of course, not everyone is convinced that the good times will keep on rolling. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who wrote the book The Black Swan about unpredictable events, said the current environment is similar to what existed during previous collapses, pointing to complacency in the market and the earlier era of low rates that taught people to avoid conservative investments.

He advised investors to pay attention to key sectors and add \"insurance\" to their portfolios. A number of Wall Street forecasters have been warning of a stock bubble as the market climbs to a series of fresh highs in 2024 — and investors worried about such a scenario should be putting their money in a handful of assets to protect themselves from the eventual bursting. That's according to David Rosenberg, a top economist and the founder of Rosenberg Research, who's been warning of a potential craash in stocks for months. In the past, he's warned of a 39% correction to stocks, among the more extreme predictions on Wall Street, where most investors are feeling optimistic about a soft landing amid a robust economy and easing interest rates. \"Watching the market these days is like watching a clown blowing up a balloon (or Chuck Prince dancing the ballroom), knowing the inevitable,\" Rosenberg said in a note to clients on Friday. \"When this mega-bubble pops, it will be spectacular.\" Investors need to exercise caution and avoid following the \"herd mentality,\" Rosenberg said, pointing to the fervor for mega-cap tech stocks. Instead, he said, investors should focus on stocks with strong business models, strong growth, and good prices, and add some \"insurance\" to their portfolios. Below are his top investment ideas for to prepare for the potential bursting of a market bubble. Healthcare and consumer staples Investors should gear their investments towards what people will always need in the future. In particular, Rosenberg recommended that investors pay attention to options in the healtcare and consumer staples sectors. \"Focus on where people are going to focus on what they need, not what they want,\" Rosenberg wrote. \"Anything related to e- commerce, cloud services, and wiring up your home to become your new office has been in a budding secular growth phase.\" Utilities Utility stocks also look promising. Other forecasters have predicted huge upside for utility firms, due to the growing need for power and data centers stemming from the AI boom. \"Utilities, as we have been saying for a long time, are as close to a 'no brainer' as there is, given their yield attributes and their being re-rated for 'defensive growth' owing to enhanced earnings visibility through the strong and secular outlook for US power needs,\" Rosenberg said.

Stocks ended mixed on Monday, with a modest decline for the S&P 500, a larger pullback for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a gain for the tech-focused Nasdaq as bond markets returned to their recent volatility. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, rose 11 basis points on the session, while adding another in overnight trading, and were last marked at a three month high of 4.208% heading into the New York session. Merrill Lynch's MOVE index, which tracks fixed income volatility and is known as the 'VIX for bonds', is trading at the highest levels of the year and is up nearly 48.6% from its early July lows. Messaging from Federal Reserve officials that suggested a slower pace of rate cuts, election uncertainty and the prospect of higher deficits regardless of who wins the White House and renewed inflation concerns tied to the outperforming economy have all combined to drive yields higher. The moves are sapping risk sentiment in markets around the world, and driving the dollar index to multi-month highs against a basket of its global peers. That's being played out in this mornings premarket session, where futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 suggest a 28 point pullback, with the Dow called 200 points lower and the Nasdaq poised of a 130 point decline.

The aerospace giant has struggled with manufacturing problems, management turmoil, horrible financial results, and, since September, a crippling labor strike. Boeing saw a little ray of sunshine on Oct. 21. Over the weekend, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said its 33,000 members will vote on a new contract from Boeing  (BA) , which is among the most iconic of U.S. companies. Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter The vote will come Oct. 23, and there's hope — but hardly any certainty — that the contract will pass. Indeed, some analysts think it won't pass because of the negative comments from Boeing workers that they've seen on social media. Related: Goldman Sachs reveals long-term S&P 500 outlook Nonetheless, Boeing shares were up 4.8% to $159.82 on Oct. 21, their highest close since Sept. 4. The stock was the top performer of stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and third best among stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Boeing shares, however, are still down 38.6% on the year and more than 40% from their 52-week high reached in December 2023. The union agreed early on Oct. 19 to put Boeing's latest proposal — its third in less than two months — to its membership, saying that it was \"worthy of your consideration.\" The strike began on Sept. 13 after 94% of union members rejected an offer supported by union management. The union refused even to consider a second Boeing offer. The new proposal calls for 35% salary increase over four years, up from 30% offered earlier by Boeing. It also boosts the ratification bonus to $7,000 from the previous $6,000 offer. The one demand Boeing refused to consider was re-establishing its traditional pension plan. Boeing has said that average annual pay for machinists is currently $75,608. The strike by workers in Washington, Oregon, and California has halted production of Boeing 737s including the 737 Max, and 767s and 777s. Boeing is continuing to build 787 Dreamliners at a nonunion plant near Charleston, S.C. The strike is costing Boeing an estimated $1 billion a month, and new CEO Kelly Ortberg is working to keep the company afloat. Boeing is raising up to $25 billion through stock and debt offerings. It's arranging a $10 billion credit agreement with major lenders amid a production and regulatory crisis. Bloomberg/Getty Images Analysts at JP Morgan, led by Seth Seifman, kept their rating on Boeing at overweight with a $195 price target. But the group noted the deal, if passed, will boost Boeing's costs by at least $1 billion a year.               ",

Let’s take a look at how Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) and the rest of the cybersecurity stocks fared in Q2. Cybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location. The 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. In light of this news, cybersecurity stocks have held steady with share prices up 3% on average since the latest earnings results. Founded in 2000 with the idea that network security comes before endpoint security, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) provides software as a service that helps companies understand where they are exposed to cyber security risks, quickly detect breaches and respond to them. Rapid7 reported revenues of $208 million, up 9.2% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with accelerating customer growth and full-year revenue guidance exceeding analysts’ expectations. “Rapid7 delivered solid second quarter results in line with our expectations, growing ARR by 9% year-over-year to $816 million, and continuing to innovate to bring customers the strongest security operations data platform,” said Corey Thomas, Chairman and CEO of Rapid7. Interestingly, the stock is up 20.4% since reporting and currently trades at $39.80. Is now the time to buy Rapid7? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.

Nvidia  (NVDA)  has been the big kahuna. The dominant provider of semiconductors for AI applications has seen its stock price more than triple during that period. 🐂 Free Newsletter From TheStreet - TheStreet 🐻 Some experts, such as Harvard economist Larry Summers, consider AI equal in importance to the Industrial Revolution. MANDEL NGAN/Getty Images “This offers the prospect of not replacing some forms of human labor, but almost all forms of human labor,” he said at Fortune's Innovation Forum earlier this year. “AI will substitute for a doctor making a difficult diagnosis … before it substitutes for a nurse’s ability to hold a patient’s hand when the patient is frightened,” he said. But not everyone is convinced AI will be such a big deal. It’s certainly not a big factor yet, says Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs. “We're a couple years into this, and there's not a single thing that this is being used for that's cost effective at this point,” he said in a Goldman podcast. Related: Nvidia stock hits record high as key AI player smashes Q3 earnings Trillions of dollars are set to be spent on developing AI infrastructure, such as data centers and applications, Covello noted. So what trillion-dollar problem is AI going to solve, he asks. This technology transition differs from any he’s seen in the last 30 years. “Historically, we've always had a very cheap solution replacing a very expensive solution,” Covello said. “Here, you have a very expensive solution that's meant to replace low-cost labor. That doesn't even make any sense from the jump.” If you do want to invest in AI, “keep buying the infrastructure provider stocks,” he said in the June-July podcast. Related: Open AI is burning cash (and losing billions!) “Is it really expensive? Absolutely. But I've never seen a stock that goes down only because it's expensive. It got expensive for a reason. People believe in the fundamental growth outlook.” Covello said if the stock drops, it will be due to a growth problem, not because of the valuation. Investment legend Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO money management firm ($66 billion of assets), takes an inverse view to Covello. Grantham thinks AI is a huge deal in the long term, but he thinks AI stocks are overdone in the short term.             ",

Cigna’s stock dropped as much as 3.2% at the New York market open Monday following a Bloomberg News report late Friday that the insurance giants had revived discussions. Humana shares rose as much as 3.1% on Monday. The companies abandoned merger talks late last year after the sides couldn’t agree on a price, Bloomberg reported in December. Since then, however, Humana’s shares lost more than 40% of their value through Friday’s close, as the Medicare-focused insurer struggled with rising care expenses and stricter federal payment policies. The company’s stock price plunged this month on a surprise downgrade to crucial Medicare quality scores linked to billions in government payments. The insurer is contesting those ratings. Humana “may want to get paid for a view that the inherent earnings of the business is materially higher” than an offer based on its current stock price would reflect, Leerink Partners analyst Whit Mayo wrote. A deal would draw attention from antitrust regulators, who might try to block it, TD Cowen analyst Ryan Langston wrote. “Any formal announcement before the presidential election seems highly unlikely,” he wrote. Cigna, meanwhile, is exiting the Medicare market and has been a bright spot during a difficult year for US health insurers. Its shares rose about 30% since the merger talks ended last year through Friday’s closing price. “Strategically, we think this deal make sense, the financial part is harder to support,” Mayo wrote.

They see the AI market growing to $400 billion, giving Nvidia a \"generational opportunity.\" They point to Nvidia's strong lead among competitors, helped by its enterprise partnerships. Nvidia stock has been on a tear all year, but investors can brace for even more gains ahead, Bank of America analysts say. In a Thursday note, the analysts raised their price objective on the stock from $165 to $190. That implies a 38% upside from its price of about $138 a share at midday on Friday. The analysts point to exponential growth in the AI market in the coming years, which they say will give Nvidia a \"generational opportunity\" as the chip titan continues to strengthen its lead in the market. The analysts see the AI accelerator market growing to $280 billion by 2027, and toward upwards of $400 billion over time — marking huge growth from $45 billion in 2023. As AI models continue to grow rapidly—with developers like OpenAI, Google, and Meta launching new large language models several times per year—the need for computing will only grow, the analysts predict. Each new major LLM generation, especially those developed for larger size and better reasoning capabilities, will require greater training intensity, they add. \"We continue to see the pace of new model development increase. LLMs in particular are being developed for both larger size and better reasoning capabilities, which both require greater training intensity,\" the analysts said. They also point to Nvidia's strong partnerships with enterprise customers like Accenture, ServiceNow, Oracle, and others, which show the growing presence of AI at big companies and Nvidia's role as partner of choice. \"NVDA's engagements span multiple verticals (e.g., Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft), and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side,\" the analysts said. The analysts also said Nvidia's financials are set up well for future gains. Given its free cash flow generation at 45%-50% margins, which is nearly double that of other Magnificent 7 stocks, Nvidia will be able to generate $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, they wrote. Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed this year, up 187% as AI continues to boom after a brief sell-off over the summer. The sector has since recovered, with chip stocks like Nvidia and TSMC trading at or near all-time highs in recent weeks. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) — The trading debut of Tokyo Metro Co., which runs one of the world’s largest subway systems, is set to support the bull case for the Japanese stock market after an oversubscribed public offering. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance Japan’s biggest listing in six years got more than 15 times demand, some of the underwriters said Tuesday. The sale is a key gauge of appetite for Japanese shares just days before a crucial election that may shape expectations for further interest-rate rises. The initial public offering of Tokyo Metro, which runs an extensive network of underground train services in the world’s most-populous metropolitan area, raised ¥348.6 billion ($2.3 billion) as investors were attracted by its reputation for safety and reliability. The IPO priced at the top of the range, indicating hot demand for a stable stock with a juicy dividend yield that drew in retail buyers. The listing brings into focus the contrast between Tokyo’s efficient, government-owned subway system, and counterparts in major global cities such as New York and London, which are weighed down by debt and aging infrastructure. “This is an attractive asset with brand recognition,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at financial-advisory firm Astris Advisory Japan. “The financials are generally stable, not a lot of volatility.” Foreign investors in particular sought more than 35 times the amount of shares on offer to them, the underwriters said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The IPO price of ¥1,200 and Tokyo Metro’s estimated dividend of ¥40 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2025 gives a 3.3% yield. That compares with less than 2% for ground transport companies in Japan, according to data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as of end-September. On top of that come perks for investors such as free train tickets and golf, which Hiroaki Tomori, executive fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., estimates would increase the dividend yield to 4.9%. That’s an attractive in a country where years of ultra-low rates have starved investors of returns. “Investors who have had no experience in stock trading felt that it was like a festival and wanted to apply for the commemorative issue,” said Yutaka Tokushige, manager of the business promotion division at the head office of FFG Securities Co., one of the underwriters.

To me, everything has a place. Awesome desk organization, awesome outcomes, is how my head works. But I broke this rule slightly by the close of trading on Friday. Going forward, I will have a paper cutout of Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang in his trademark leather jacket thumbtacked to the wallboard (see pic below). And I'll tell you why. For one full day this week I forgot to check Nvidia's stock price my usual 10 times a day — only checking in five times. I let myself (and you all) down because, in the blink of an eye, Nvidia's stock went from a quick sell-off from the Monday record highs back to those same highs come the end of the week. I missed it! The stock is up 13% in October, dusting the 1.4% gain for the S&P 500. AMD's (AMD) stock is down by 5% this month, similar to Intel (INTC). So Jensen's face on my desk is a reminder to check in with Nvidia's stock price and fundamentals numerous times a day. And to ask everyone I encounter about Nvidia, even people not in the chip space (as I did at one annual CEO dinner this week hosted by ServiceNow's (NOW) CEO Bill McDermott). Here's what I was reminded of by recommitting to an Nvidia obsession: Something insanely bad from a company-specific perspective will be the only thing taking this market darling down for any prolonged period of time. To be honest with you, I don't see where that insanely bad stuff would sprout from over the next few quarters. Neither do the array of plugged-in characters I chat up each week. \"I don't think when you get to Nvidia, there is any hype at all. I have known Jensen for decades, and he is the real deal. What these guys are doing is very real and very powerful,\" C3.ai (AI) founder and CEO Tom Siebel told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). Hey Sam Altman, you should watch what Siebel thinks about your latest valuation... Anyhow, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Antonio Neri has known Jensen for ages. I didn't get the sense Nvidia's products were anything but super hot sellers in a chat with him, yours truly, and Seana Smith on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. \"When you think about the large-scale [cloud] providers, what they want is to come to market with the latest technologies. And obviously, Blackwell is a key component of that as they go from air-cooled to the liquid cooling, more power density and more performance, and they are on track to do that,\" Neri said about Nvidia.

        "body": "By Iain Withers and Sinead Cruise LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's commercial property market is returning to life after its post-pandemic freeze, albeit largely at much lower prices. Some big-ticket office properties now on sale will show just where the market is likely to bottom out and how briskly UK deal volumes will recover - especially in the hard-hit office market. How that plays out could in turn signal what awaits other countries still gripped by a deeper downturn. Real estate investor Nuveen has put a 21-storey City of London tower it completed in 2019, informally known as the \"Can of Ham\" due to its rounded shape, up for sale for 322 million pounds ($419 million), below about 400 million pounds it had sought in 2022, a person familiar with the matter said. Canada's Brookfield is seeking around 500 million pounds for its nearby Citypoint tower, according to industry data provider CoStar. That compares with its most recent formal valuation of 670 million pounds, and its 560 million price tag when last sold in 2016, according to CoStar. New office buildings are seeing robust demand, with investor M&G's new office towers at 40 Leadenhall in the City of London more than 80% let. But a recent tour showed what it needed to do to attract tenants, with the building offering saunas, treatment rooms, a hair salon, a yoga room, Peloton fitness suite, a cinema room and a library - most for the exclusive use of office tenants. \"We had a conviction that tenants would want to upgrade their space,\" said Martin Towns, deputy global head of M&G Real Estate. Some out-of-favour older offices would have to be converted into other uses like housing, or demolished, he said. The COVID-19 pandemic pummelled global commercial property markets by driving up inflation and financing costs, while causing a shift to hybrid and remote work that meant most tenants wanted less, but higher quality office space. The cost of building prime offices in London has risen to more than 500 pounds per square foot now from less than 400 pounds before the pandemic, construction consultancy Turner & Townsend alinea said. Half of that increase was down to inflation, with the rest down to better amenities and green credentials, it said. While some properties, such as older out-of-town offices, remain near-impossible to sell, the British market is improving for prime offices, rental housing and logistics, investors said. A global retreat in inflation and interest rates is starting to ease financing costs and improve properties' appeal relative to other investments.               ",

        "body": "The French media giant behind the Paddington films is seeking a valuation of up to €8bn (£6.7bn) when it lists on the London Stock Exchange, which would make it the largest debut listing of the year. Canal+, which owns Paddington producer StudioCanal, is expected to appear on the LSE in mid-December as part of a spinout by its parent company Vivendi. City sources said the debut is likely to value Canal+ in a range between €6bn and €8bn – which would give the embattled market a much-needed boost. London has faced a dearth of new companies coming to the market this year, with the £540m Raspberry Pi float and £400m listing of Applied Nutrition the only notable debuts. A listing of Canal+ would be the largest deal for the London market since 2022 when healthcare giant Haleon was spun out by GSK and Pfizer in a £31bn deal. Canal+ would be big enough to be in the FTSE 100, although it is unclear if the group will join the blue chip index. Much like Sky in the UK, Canal+ operates a pay-TV service which combines its own channels with access to streaming platforms such as Netflix, Disney and Apple TV. It also owns StudioCanal, a major production business behind films including the Paddington series, Bridget Jones’s Diary, Johnny English and About a Boy. Canal+ operates in more than 50 countries worldwide, with almost two thirds of its subscribers now outside of its home market in France. It is currently in the process of taking over MultiChoice, Africa’s largest pay-TV operator, in a deal worth almost $3bn (£2.4bn) that will expand the group’s international footprint further. Canal+ is understood to have chosen the LSE because of its appeal to international investors. The listing forms part of a wider break-up of Vivendi, the French media conglomerate controlled by billionaire Vincent Bolloré. Vivendi plans to float its Havas advertising agency in Amsterdam, while also creating a new investment division centred on its publishing subsidiary Lagardère. The final part of Vivendi will remain listed in Paris and oversee a portfolio of investments, most notably the group’s 10pc stake in Universal Music Group, the world’s largest record company. The break-up plan has been orchestrated by Mr Bolloré, the 72-year-old industrialist and corporate raider who is Vivendi’s largest shareholder. The patriarch stood down as chairman in 2018, handing over control to his son Yannick. However, he still exerts a strong influence over the business, which has been struggling for direction since the blockbuster flotation of Universal in 2021. Vivendi has said it hopes the break-up will boost its valuations. The company has argued it suffers from a “significant” share price discount because of its status as a sprawling conglomerate.           ",

The price target represents ~8 times Moley’s new 2026 revenue EPS estimate (up from ~7 times 2026 previously) to reflect the incremental revenue opportunity presented by adding index options & futures. Last week, Robinhood hosted its first inaugural Robinhood Markets Summit 2024 and introduced several new products to its customer base. Also Read: Microsoft, Salesforce Battle Heats Up As AI Agent Technology Takes Center Stage In addition to the latest web-based trading platform (“Robinhood Legend”), Robinhood Markets reiterated plans to launch index options and futures trading in the coming months and revealed details on pricing. In index options, Gold subscribers will pay $0.35 per contract, and non-gold subscribers will pay $0.50 per contract. In futures, Gold subscribers will pay $0.50 per contract, and non-gold subscribers will pay $0.75 per contract. Given these pricing disclosures, the analyst raised his 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates by ~5%. He increased his 2025 and 2026 EPS estimates by 4 cents each from $0.67 and $0.87 to $0.71 and $0.91. Moley’s base case for 2025-26 assumes index options are ~10% accretive to Robinhood Markets’ total options volume, futures trading accounts for ~5% of Robinhood Markets’ total DARTs, and Gold customers account for 75% of volumes in both index options and futures trading, as for Moley. This is uncharted territory for Robinhood Markets, which built a brand as the zero-commission online broker for the masses, he added. The more compelling near-term opportunity for Robinhood Markets could lie with active retail traders on competitor platforms drawn in by Robinhood Markets’ lower prices. Moley noted that these product launches for Robinhood Markets will likely put pricing pressure on the incumbents in both index options and futures trading. Moley summed up that while Robinhood Markets’ offering might not be as robust as its competitors, the combination of its new web platform, incentive match programs, and lower pricing on popular tools for active retail traders might just be enough to win market share among more sophisticated, active retail traders.

Per Reuters, Wall Street expects the company's third-quarter adjusted earnings per share to come in at $6.50 on revenue of $17.28 billion, the latter of which is a 2.8% year-over-year increase. Ahead of the event, LMT is up 0.4% at $614.04, and earlier touched a record high of $618.95. Over the last two years, LMT finished post-earnings sessions higher five times, and averaged a 3.3% pop, regardless of direction. This time around, the options pits expect a next-day swing of 5.6%. Speaking of the options pits, Lockheed Martin stock is seeing higher-than-usual intraday put volume before the earnings call. Around the session's halfway point, 6,156 calls and 4,545 puts have traded hands, with bearish bets running at double the amount usually seen at this point. New positions are opening at the most active, weekly 10/25 540-strike call. Over the last 12 months, the security cleared marked several significant achievements including conquering early 2024 resistance at the $460 level and a mid-summer post-earnings rally that set it on a path of higher highs. LMT now boasts a 35.4% year-to-date lead. Despite LMT's outperformance, analysts still aren't on board. Relative to its current perch, the stock's 12-month consensus target price of $588.77 is a 4.2% discount, and nine of 21 covering brokerages rate it a \"hold\" or worse. This negative sentiment could shift if Lockheed Martin stock grabs more record highs in the event of a quarterly beat. ",

Dan Howley reports: The smartphone industry is banking on AI to reaccelerate device sales after years of slowing growth. But to do that, it’ll have to give consumers a reason to pony up for new phones more often.

On Monday, Qualcomm shares were down almost 2%. Read more here. An early trend is emerging through the first part of quarterly earnings reports.

General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) are among several other big names on the earnings docket this week. Boeing (BA) stock jumped as much as 4.5% in Monday's premarket on news that the aircraft manufacturer has reached a tentative labor deal with workers who have been on strike for more than one month. The contract would raise pay 35% over four years and increase Boeing's 401(k) contributions, but it would not reinstate pension plans — a major union demand. Analysts estimate the contract could lead to an additional $1 billion in wage-related expenses for the company. The union will vote on the contract on Wednesday, the same day Boeing reports its quarterly earnings. Analysts expect the plane maker to report a loss per share of $1.50, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Boeing has struggled since an airplane part ripped off one of its 737 Max 9 planes during a flight in January. Shares are down over 40% this year. Of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg, some 19 recommend buying shares, while 11 have a Hold rating, and three say to sell.

Equity valuations are stretched, corporate bond spreads are tightening and gold is at a record.

Alongside all the prudence, though, a vocal subset of managers has emerged whose outlook is decidedly less wary. Despite the headwinds facing investors at this point in the economic cycle, they say there’s reason to believe it’s still early in the bull run for risky assets. One is Nancy Tengler, who helps oversee $1.4 billion for Laffer Tengler Investments in Scottsdale, Arizona. Convinced corporate earnings growth is greater than it seems thanks to a steep falloff in inflation that is also bolstering consumers, she’s pushing clients out of Treasuries and into a broader list of bets on municipal bonds, electrical equipment makers and utilities. “The growth is there and it’s still driven by the consumer,” she said. “Earnings season will be pretty robust. We will see more surprises to the upside than to the downside. We are very bullish.” Stocks rose again this week, with the S&P 500 climbing almost 1% for its sixth straight gain, the longest streak since December. Ten-year Treasury yields were little changed after a four-week advance spurred by the unwinding of bets on outsized interest-rate reductions. In credit, the iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF started the week with its best three-day advance since mid-September, while oil had its first weekly decline this month. The simplest case for optimism remains the economy, where Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve is undoing two years of restrictive policy as inflation subsides. Data this week showed both the US consumer and labor market are holding up, while bank executives issued almost unanimously positive outlooks as earnings broadly beat expectations. On Thursday, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracking estimate saw another upward revision, and is now forecasting third-quarter GDP at 3.4%. To Philip Camporeale, a multi-asset portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, it’s almost as if the economic cycle is “aging backwards and extending, because the Fed is easing policy with a very low probability of recession,” he said. “Macro volatility is lower today than it’s been over the last two years,” he added. Camporeale maintained the overweight in stocks relative to bonds he’s had all year and is adding riskier bets such as emerging markets equities.                ",

        "body": "Many Gen Zers and millennials today are forced to rent (or live with their parents) because of the sheer cost of buying a house—and the lucky few who did get on the housing ladder are now stuck in their starter home sweet home. Baby’s first home has some staying power, not unlike Fisher Prices’ other non-biodegradable heirlooms, according to new research by Edelman Financial Engines. High interest rates are keeping Americans tied to their abode: Over a third (36%) of homeowners report feeling stuck in their house and unable to move for said reason. This rises to nearly 50% for homeowners under 50, who are mostly made up of Gen Z and millennials. But even some young Gen Xers in this group are finding themselves in dire straits. Last year, the Fed raising interest rates sent mortgages to a 22-year high. While the rates have since ebbed, many homeowners are feeling still a little burnt by the market. Many (72%) Americans report being concerned about the current rates, rising to 81% for those under 50. Part of the issue is that because the market is so thorny, many young Americans are forced to pour all their money into their first home. To afford a median-priced starter home, prospective buyers must earn about $80,000 a year, per Redfin. Then their salary isn’t rising enough to keep up with their desire to move from an apartment to that three-bedroom house with a garage, like their parents did. “Americans need to earn more than a year ago—and much more than before the pandemic—to afford a starter home because mortgage rates are elevated, and home prices are near record highs,” reads the report. Most Americans are, therefore, priced out. Just over half of households (50.1%) earn $75,000 or less, according to U.S. Census data, points out Fortune’s Alena Botros The situation is so dire that wannabe presidents have taken note in order to curry favor with Americans. “I’ve been doing housing for a long time. It is the first time that I could remember where both sides are talking about housing,” Fannie Mae CEO and president Priscilla Almodovar said at Fortune’s MPW Summit of the presidential election, noting that it demonstrates the “affordability crisis” at large. It all means that once Americans can finally get their hands on a home, they’re not able to release. With so much liquidity in one investment, it can be hard to re-enter the market and afford increasingly expensive property. And on the other hand, older homeowners are often not looking to move and give up their relatively low mortgage rates they once had.           ",

Analysts are also boosting their end-of-year targets for the benchmark, which is now within just 2.5% of a 6,000-point mark that seemed impossible to scale just a few months ago. 🐂 Sign UP Today: Free Newsletter From TheStreet - TheStreet 🐻 The long bull rally, which began more than two years ago, however, faces a key test from the bond market over the coming weeks. Investors have marked up Treasury yields in the face of resurgent inflation risks and reckless fiscal spending promises from both Presidential candidates that threaten even larger debt and deficit levels. Benchmark 10-year paper hit the highest levels since late July in early Monday trading, changing hands at 4.138% extending a slump that has added more than 50 basis points to the most important interest rate in world financial markets. It must be noted that that move followed an outsized 50 basis points rate cut from the Federal Reserve in mid-September, a decision that some investors are now wondering may stoke inflation pressures. The economy continues its above-trend growth, oil prices remain elevated amid geopolitical tensions in the Persian Gulf region, and the job market consistently surprises to the upside. For the moment, however, stocks are poised to extend their longer-term run despite trading at 22 times future earnings estimates, a valuation level that is considered expensive in historical terms. \"October's stock market is bucking the historical trend with remarkably little volatility,\" \"While there are plenty of reasons why stocks should be choppy, from election uncertainty to rising geopolitical tensions, the market is overlooking all of these worries as it's become clear that a soft landing is upon us,\" said David Laut, chief investment officer at Abound Financial in Granite Bay, California.

Lucid shares were down 3% on Monday after falling sharply last week following the stock sale.

Silver futures (SI=F) gained more than 3% before paring gains, briefly topping $34 per ounce, the highest level in 12 years. The two precious metals have outperformed the broader markets, with bullion rising 26% year to date and silver gaining 35% during the same period, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of 19% since the start of 2024. Gold purchases by central banks, which hit a record in the first quarter of 2024, have been one of the biggest drivers of the precious metal's rise this year. BofA analysts estimate gold has surpassed the euro to become the world's largest reserve asset, second only to the US dollar. Investors have also flocked to physically backed gold exchange-traded funds, with inflow up three months in a row, according to the World Gold Council. \"I think it's the declining inflation expectation and also the rotation of assets that tend to perform well with a more dovish Fed,” Phil Streible, Blue Line Futures chief market strategist, told Yahoo Finance on Monday morning.

JPMorgan analysts cited sentiment at the recent London Bullion Market Association/London Platinum and Palladium Market conference, with attendees forecasting an average year-ahead price of $45 per ounce for the grey metal. \"This bullish view is driven by a sense that silver is undervalued vs gold, less crowded, and supported by multifaceted, versatile demand applications,\" wrote JPMorgan analysts on Friday. Silver is used across different industries, from electronics to fuel cells in automobile components and solar panels. The analysts see uncertainty ahead for the metal if former President Donald Trump were to win the presidential election. \"We are bullish silver ourselves, though for this strong silver outperformance to eventuate, we likely need to see industrial metals prices continue to rally in 2025, something that could get complicated under a Trump presidency and a hard line on tariffs early next year, despite Chinese stimulus,\" said the note.

APE ecosystem's governance and utility token APE has doubled in value to $1.50 since the weekend, leading the broader market higher. Options activity on PowerTrade, a crypto exchange focused on derivatives tied to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), suggests that the recent strong bullish momentum is expected to persist in the short term. Open interest, or the number of active APE options contracts, surged by over 800% to 263,000 ($394.5K) in one day, PowerTrade told CoinDesk Monday, adding that call options or derivatives, offering an asymmetric upside potential, account for over 80% of the tally. Call buyers are implicitly bullish on the underlying asset. Most activity is concentrated on the Oct. 22 and Oct. 25 expiry contracts, with traders buying higher strike out-of-the-money (OTM) calls at strikes as high as $2.2 or nearly 50% higher than APE's going market price. The activity in APE options is noteworthy, considering the token has a market capitalization of just $1 billion and represents growing sophistication in the altcoin space. That said, open interest and volume are way lower than the billions of dollars locked in BTC and ETH options contracts listed on the leading exchange Deribit. The bullish expectations likely stem from the Apechain mainnet launch and LayerZero's integration. PowerTrade offers European-styled USD-settled options with one contract representing 1 APE as underlying. The exchange debuted the request-for-quote (RFQ) model for the options market in late 2022, allowing the execution of multi-legged strategies as a single instrument.

        "body": "As the Q1 earnings season comes to a close, it’s time to take stock of this quarter’s best and worst performers in the environmental and facilities services industry, including Veralto (NYSE:VLTO) and its peers. Many environmental and facility services are non-discretionary (sports stadiums need to be cleaned after events), recurring, and performed through longer-term contracts. This makes for more predictable and stickier revenue streams. Additionally, there has been an increasing focus on emissions and water conservation over the last decade, driving innovation in the sector and demand for new services. Despite these tailwinds, environmental and facility services companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact commercial construction projects that drive incremental demand for these services. The 15 environmental and facilities services stocks we track reported a mixed Q1. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Thankfully, environmental and facilities services stocks have been resilient with share prices up 7.9% on average since the latest earnings results. Spun off from Danaher in 2023, Veralto (NYSE:VLTO) provides water analytics and treatment solutions. Veralto reported revenues of $1.25 billion, up 1.5% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.6%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ operating margin estimates and a decent beat of analysts’ earnings estimates.

But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products.

While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.

Cikos noted that GitLab has expanded its product offerings, with Ultimate gaining traction due to innovations like Duo Pro Enterprise and Dedicated. The analyst expects increased adoption of Ultimate compared to Premium, driven by stronger Enterprise sales and GitLab’s compliance and security features, which large organizations value. Also Read: GitLab Stock Climbs On Q2 Results, Strong FY 25 Guidance He said premium SKU pricing changes will also contribute to revenue growth, providing a tailwind into fiscal 2026. Cikos noted that strong incremental margins, currently around 40%, support the company’s ability to surpass revenue expectations for the October quarter. The analyst said that the debate over Premium versus Ultimate is less relevant in the current landscape, where Enterprises have larger budgets and favor Ultimate. Recent data from GitLab shows that seven out of the company’s top 10 deals in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were for Ultimate, and 65% of new dollars from $100,000-plus customers came from this tier. Innovations like Dedicated and Duo Pro, exclusive to Ultimate, further enhance its appeal. He added that enterprises offer more significant potential for cross-selling and expansion as they have larger budgets than SMBs. Cikos’ analysis indicates GitLab could exceed subscription revenue estimates for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and beyond. The analyst noted that the premium price increase, customer retention, and churn improvements should contribute to continued growth. Additionally, he anticipates operating margin expansion driven by cost discipline and leverage in the subscription model. In fiscal 2024, GitLab’s revenue grew by $155.6 million, with $85.8 million translating to adjusted operating profit, demonstrating incremental solid margins. Cikos noted that GitLab is well-positioned in a large market, sharing it with Microsoft’s GitHub. However, the analyst noted that GitLab’s focus on security and compliance gives it an edge over organizations prioritizing these features. The company also benefits from its flexible deployment options, which cater to Enterprises at different stages of their cloud journey. As a neutral vendor, GitLab attracts businesses looking to diversify their tech stack and reduce dependency on Microsoft.

Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says Hauser was speaking Monday in Sydney after rates traders pushed back the expected timing of the first RBA cut to April from February, following strong employment data on Thursday. They had previously been pricing a decent chance of an easing late this year. “I’m not making a comment about whether the absolute level of the curve is priced in the right place or not,” Hauser said at a Commonwealth Bank of Australia conference. “That’s for everyone in this room to make a judgment on but the response of rates to the data does seem to be quite encouraging.” While the RBA raised interest rates to a 12-year high of 4.35%, it has moved more cautiously than many international counterparts. That’s sparked questions over whether it has done enough to cool demand. Hauser said the central bank’s message is that policy is ready to respond in either direction, leaving the door open to a possible late-cycle hike. Underpinning economy-wide demand, data out last week showed the nation’s powerful stretch of hiring extended into September with unemployment holding steady at 4.1%. Australia’s labor market has outshone other developed world peers where tighter monetary policy has pushed jobless rates much higher. Hauser reiterated that the RBA’s strategy is to bring CPI down slowly to protect the labor market, adding inflation in Australia is still “too high.” As a result, he said, RBA rates won’t fall as much or as early as those of other central banks. Economists generally expect the RBA to be a laggard in the global easing cycle, predicting the central bank will start on an easing cycle in February. Last week’s jobs data, along with third-quarter inflation due later this month, will be important inputs for the RBA’s November policy meeting, where it’s expected to leave rates unchanged yet again. “We are data dependent but we’re not data obsessed. We have to take that number in the context of everything else,” Hauser said, referring to the employment release last week. “Activity has been weak, very weak and we haven’t seen the inflation number for the third quarter yet.”           ",

        "body": "Welcome to this week’s installment of “The Short Interest Report” – The Fly’s weekly recap of short interest trends among some of the most widely followed high-short-float stocks. Using the data from our partner Ortex.com, which utilizes the latest information from stock lenders to estimate short interest changes for thousands of publicly traded companies, this report will screen for some of biggest changes in short interest as a percentage of free float and days-to-cover ratios while also considering the short interest data on some of the more volatile and heavier-traded names of the week. Based on the availability of data from Ortex, the report tracks the trading period that covers prior Friday through Thursday of this week, excluding holidays. As a basis of comparison for stocks discussed below, the S&P 500 index was up 1.0%, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%, the Russell 2000 index was up 4.2%, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) was up 4.0%, and the Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) up 4.4% in the five-day trading session range through October 17. SHORT INTEREST GAINERS Estimated short interest on Spirit Airlines (SAVE) has continued its year-long upward climb, reaching a new all-time high this week with a four percentage point increase to 34%. It’s been an especially volatile couple of weeks for the discount airline – two Fridays ago, the stock sank nearly 40% following a Wall Street Journal report that in the wake of its failed merger with JetBlue (JBLU), the company was in discussions over the terms of a bankruptcy filing. Shares of Spirit were still down about 32% over the period of the last two weeks and down 11% in the five-day span through Thursday, though the stock bounced higher by 30% afterhours on Friday as it was able to reach a deal with creditors, extending the deadline for a debt restructuring to December. Ortex-reported short interest on Westrock Coffee (WEST) had consolidated a 24 percentage point ascend to 73% from early August through mid-September with about a ten percentage point retreat, though bearish positioning has once again been on the rise over the past two weeks. This week, shorts as a percentage of free float on Westrock were up just over four points from 66.6% to 70.8%, even though the stock appears to have found its footing. Shares had fallen 47% from July-end to their 2024 lows on October 7th, though the stock has since bounced 29% and was up 26% in the five-day period covered through Thursday. Ortex-reported short positioning on CompoSecure (CMPO) saw an upside breach of 60% in mid-September followed by a two-week period of retreat to about 45%. This week however, shorts as a percentage of free float jumped again, rising from 45.1% all the way to 63.1% – a record high. Bearish exposure is tracking the stock price higher as short look to fade the stock advance to its all-time high on Wednesday. CompoSecure shares were up 11% in the five-day period covered through Thursday, and the stock is now up 179% year-to-date.           ",

        "body": "TOKYO (AP) — Global shares mostly declined in cautious trading Tuesday ahead of earnings reports around the globe, as Wall Street’s long, record-breaking rally lost steam. France's CAC 40 lost 0.3% to 7,516.20, while the German DAX rose 0.4% to 19,526.85. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.5% to 8,281.14. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.3%. In Asian trading, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 1.4% to finish at 38,411.96. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.7% to 8,205.70, while South Korea's Kospi slipped 1.3% to 2,570.70. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.1% to 20,498.95 and the Shanghai Composite rose 0.5% to 3,285.87 following a cut to interest rates that took effect on Monday. “The next two weeks are set to be a wild ride. Volatility has surged across stocks, bonds, and currencies as investors brace for a perfect storm of risks: a hotly contested U.S. election, critical interest-rate decisions in both the U.S. and Europe, the looming threat of a wider Middle East conflict, and the ever-present pressure of quarterly earnings,” Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. On Monday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% and the Dow dropped 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. Wall Street’s rally to records this year has been based on hopes the U.S. economy can escape from the worst inflation in generations without a painful recession that many investors had worried could be inevitable. With the Federal Reserve now cutting interest rates to keep the economy humming, optimists hope stocks can rise even further. But critics are warning stock prices look too expensive given they’ve climbed much faster than corporate profits. That puts pressure on companies to deliver growth in profits to justify their stock prices, and more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to give details this week about their performances during the summer. That includes such heavyweights as AT&T, Coca-Cola, IBM, General Motors and Tesla. The Bank of Canada will also announce its latest decision on interest rates Wednesday, where it could cut by half a percentage point. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 20 cents to $69.84 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 18 cents to $74.11 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 150.99 Japanese yen from 150.69 yen. The euro rose to $1.0829 from $1.0819. ",

He pushed the drugmaker to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine at lightning speed. The Greek-born CEO’s bold bet paid off. The shot turned Pfizer into a household name, while ringing up tens of billions of dollars in sales. Bourla’s cellphone hummed with calls from leaders around the world. The experience, he said in a commencement speech afterward, showed the virtue of “setting ambitious goals that are seemingly impossible.” A Mystery $30 Million Wave of Pro-Trump Bets Has Moved a Popular Prediction Market You’re Not Paranoid. The Market Is Out to Get You. The $14 Billion Question Dividing OpenAI and Microsoft In Sports, American Socialism Is Beating European Capitalism Regulator Investigates Tesla’s Automated-Driving Feature After Fatal Crash But now Bourla is under attack because Pfizer’s stock price is way down, in part because it miscalculated demand for its Covid-19 vaccine, and some of the ambitious goals Bourla has set in the years since the pandemic have yet to pan out. An activist investor is leading the charge. Starboard Value, a hedge fund that has waged fights in recent months against Autodesk, Salesforce and Tinder parent Match Group, recently took a roughly $1 billion stake in Pfizer. The sides held their first meeting on Wednesday, after Starboard accused the company of pressuring two former executives who had been working with Starboard to express support for Bourla. It’s a moment of reckoning for Bourla, 62, a veterinarian by training who joined Pfizer in his early 30s from academia and moved all over the globe for the company as he climbed the corporate ladder. Bourla enjoys strong support from Pfizer’s board of directors, according to people familiar with the board’s thinking. Members recognize Bourla’s success spearheading the Covid-19 vaccine, and steps he has taken to right the ship over the last year, including multibillion-dollar cost-cutting programs. The CEO has also reorganized the company, creating a separate cancer-drug research unit in a bet that breakthroughs there will bring in billions in new sales. But Pfizer so far has been unable to escape its postpandemic slump. After the Covid-19 emergency receded, sales of the company’s vaccine and antiviral tanked, much more than executives forecast. New drug launches under-delivered. Pfizer’s first stab at the booming anti-obesity market flamed out. Wall Street noticed, sending Pfizer stock down. Today Wall Street values Pfizer at roughly $166 billion, roughly half its peak during the pandemic.                                     ",

        "body": "The ASEAN Light Vehicle (LV) market dropped by 7% YoY in August and 7% YoY from January to August 2024. This negative sales performance was weighed down by double-digit declines in Indonesia and Thailand. In Indonesia, sales plunged by 15% YoY in August and 17% YoY in the first eight months overall. According to Daihatsu’s management, the market was impacted by tightened credit approvals and lower purchasing power. Furthermore, many consumers and businesses adopted a wait-and-see approach around the presidential election in February, and many are likely still waiting until the new president takes office on October 20, 2024, and potentially announces incentives for vehicle sales. Key developments for the Indonesian market include GAIKINDO’s request for a tax cut policy in early October, following the current government’s rejection of GAIKINDO's proposal for tax cut measures in August, as well as the central bank’s surprise interest rate cut from 6.25% to 6.0% in September. However, the interest rate cut is not expected to have a significant impact on LV sales, as it remains high compared to the rate of 3.5% that was seen during the COVID-19 era, and the financial sector may not loosen credit approvals due to high nonperforming loans (NPLs). Due to this negative sentiment, the country’s LV sales will drop by 14% YoY to 799k units in 2024. In Thailand, LV sales continued to decline by 24% YoY in August, resulting in a 23% YoY decrease from January to August. By vehicle type, Passenger Vehicle (PV) and Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) sales fell by 14% YoY and 38% YoY, respectively, in the first eight months. This downturn can be attributed to a weak economy, with financial institutions tightening car loan criteria to mitigate the risk of NPLs, as high household debt undermines consumer purchasing power. It is important to note that household debt has escalated to nearly 90% of GDP from approximately 80% prior to the pandemic. Additionally, the delayed approval of the government budget has resulted in postponements of public projects, adversely affecting LCV sales. The overall outlook for the Thai LV market continues to pose challenges, with sales anticipated to encounter persistent obstacles in the short term. Projections for 2024 now indicate a decline of 24% to 580k units, which would be the lowest level recorded since 2009. Moreover, the severe floods affecting the north and northeast of the country are likely to have adverse effects on agriculture, tourism, and the broader economy. In contrast, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam all experienced sales growth. Malaysia's LV volumes increased by 8% YoY from January to August, with LCVs (accounting for 7% of total sales) dropping by 9% YoY, while the larger PV segment (accounting for 93% of total LV sales) surged by 9% YoY. This indicates that Malaysia’s LV sales were primarily driven by PVs, thanks to the large backlog of orders created by the government's temporary tax cut measures and automakers’ policies to compensate buyers whom companies could not deliver to before the policy expired—particularly the market leader, Perodua.

That’s exactly what she did this week. Investors and analysts are split on Cathie Wood, arguably the most famous investor after Warren Buffett, the legendary billionaire behind Berkshire Hathaway. Supporters hail her as a tech visionary, while critics argue she’s a mediocre money manager with subpar performance. Affectionately dubbed \"Mama Cathie\" by fans, Wood became famous with a staggering 153% return in 2020, gaining popularity through her accessible media appearances. Related: Cathie Wood's net worth: The Ark Invest CEO's wealth & income But her longer-term performance isn't Buffett-esque. Berkshire Hathaway's annualized returns averaged about 20% since inception, approximately double the S&P 500's return over the same time period. However, Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF  (ARKK) , with $5.6 billion in assets, is down 10% in 2024, and returns have been negative 26% for the past three years and only 3% for five years. That pales in comparison to the S&P 500. The benchmark index posted positive annualized returns of 36% for one year, 11% for three years, and 16% for five years. Getty Images / SOPA Images Cathie Wood focuses on disruptive innovation and invests in high-growth tech sectors like artificial intelligence, genomics, and blockchain. Her strategy emphasizes long-term potential and cutting-edge technologies despite short-term volatility. Wood maintains that companies in those categories will be game changers, presumably with game-changing returns. However, high-growth stocks tend to be quite volatile, so the Ark funds’ values often fluctuate widely. Morningstar, one of the most popular companies evaluating mutual fund and exchange-traded fund performance, is critical of Wood and Ark Innovation ETF. Related: Cathie Wood buys $15 million of soaring mega-cap tech stocks Investing in emerging companies with slim earnings “demands forecasting talent, which ARK Investment Management lacks,” wrote Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold. “Results range from tremendous to horrendous.” In a July 2024 post on Ark’s website, Wood defended her strategy, admitting that “the macro environment and some stock picks have challenged our recent performance.” However, she emphasized that her “commitment to investing in disruptive innovation has not wavered,” noting that many of Ark’s stocks are now in “rare, deep value territory.”                ",

Nonetheless, Wall Street is optimistic about certain EV stocks due to their resilient performance in a tough business backdrop and improving financials. We used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to place Nio (NIO), Li Auto (LI), and Tesla (TSLA) against each other to pick the EV stock with the highest upside potential, according to Wall Street analysts. Shares of Chinese EV maker Nio are down more than 42% year-to-date even after witnessing a solid rally in September due to China’s stimulus measures and improving numbers. However, uncertainty about the Chinese government’s measures to support the EV sector and intense competition continue to drag down Nio stock. Despite a tough business backdrop, Nio reported solid deliveries in September. The company delivered 21,181 vehicles, reflecting a 35.4% year-over-year increase. Its Q3 deliveries grew 11.6% to 61,855 vehicles. The September numbers included 832 units of the company’s first mass-market model Onvo L60, which was launched on September 19. Recently, Nio announced that a group of Chinese investors will invest RMB3.3 billion in its subsidiary Nio China, while the company itself will invest an additional RMB10 billion. Reacting to the news, Daiwa analyst Kelvin Lau noted that Nio China is the core operational entity for the company and the cash injection by existing shareholders is a favorable development that supports the business operations. Lau has a Buy rating on Nio stock. HSBC analyst Yuqian Ding lowered the price target for Nio stock to $7.20 from $7.90 but maintained a Buy rating. The analyst has a constructive outlook on Nio’s volumes and margin growth, supported by strong NIO brand sales, the potential for volume expansion for ONVO L60, supply chain cost optimization, and better economies of scale. Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy recommendation on Nio stock based on eight Buys, four Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average Nio stock price target of $6.31 implies about 21% upside potential. See more NIO analyst ratings Shares of Chinese new energy vehicles (NEV) maker Li Auto have rallied about 22% over the past month due to the news on China’s stimulus measures and the company’s solid September deliveries. However, LI stock is still down more than 32% year-to-date. Recently, Li Auto reported about a 49% rise in September deliveries to 53,709 vehicles. Overall, the company’s Q3 deliveries increased 45.4% to 152,831. The company attributed the robust performance to solid order intake for Li L series and Li MEGA.            ",

        "body": "The housing market is showing signs of life. Listing activity and homes going under contract ticked up last month nationwide, the latest sign that some of the paralysis brought on by the rapid jump in mortgage rates in recent years is easing. But there’s a limit to how far the housing market can rebound as homeowners with ultra-low mortgage rates stay put instead of listing their homes and accepting today’s rates of 6% or more, a phenomenon known as the rate lock-in effect. “Generally, new listings and sales moved closer to pre-pandemic norms in September,” said Kara Ng, a housing economist at Zillow. “That’s still a long way to go in terms of normalizing supply.” In September, the biggest gains came in pricy locales like Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Jose, Calif. Those regions have higher proportions of buyers who finance their purchases and jumbo mortgages that hand homebuyers bigger monthly cost savings when mortgage rates fall. In some markets, listing prices have even dropped slightly. About 950,000 homes were on the market nationwide in September. That number has been steadily rising this year, though it’s still about 22% below 2019 levels. New listings rose by 25% or more last month compared to a year earlier in the Seattle, Silicon Valley, Denver, and Washington, D.C., areas, according to Realtor.com. Median listing prices in all of those markets top $599,000. In expensive parts of the country, any mortgage rate savings can help spark buyer interest, said Tim Nguyen, a real estate agent in Santa Clara, Calif., where the median home lists for more than $1.4 million. Average interest rates this year dropped more than a percentage point from as high as 7.22% in May to closer to 6% last month. “That always drives the market,” Nguyen said. “If you look at a $1 million home, for every percentage point drop it’s a little over $500 of savings every month. That’s significant when you need money to buy groceries.” Read more: Is this a good time to buy a house? Pending sales, a measure of homes under contract, were up by double digits in Portland, Ore., Seattle, and several California cities in recent weeks, according to Redfin. But the signs of improvement come off of a very low base — a year ago, homebuying was muted because mortgage rates were close to 8% and measures of homes under contract have remained near record-low levels for years. Nationwide, Redfin calculated that pending sales rose 3.2% year over year for the four weeks through Oct. 13. It was the biggest jump in more than three years. Troy Khuu, a San Jose-based agent, said the most desirable homes in his market — ones that are updated, located in strong school districts, and close to tech companies — are still selling above their asking price, sometimes in a matter of days. But buyers aren’t rushing to buy homes that don’t meet all of their specifications, he said.        ",

Stock-market performance is driven by profit growth, not political-landscape shifts, the bank said. Past policies have had unexpected impacts, highlighting the importance of sustainable profit growth. The outcome of the presidential election in November should have little impact on the direction of stock prices, Bank of America said. In a note on Friday, Savita Subramanian, a Bank of America strategist, said the stock market rarely cares about which political party controls the White House. Instead, investors' focus should be squarely on profit growth. \"Profits accelerating are far more important than who is sitting in the Oval Office,\" Subramanian said. Furthermore, targeted policies from lawmakers on Capitol Hill often have had the opposite impact on a sector than investors would have thought. For example, when Donald Trump took office in 2017, energy stocks were seen as a likely winner because of his friendly stance toward oil drilling, while renewable-energy stocks were seen as a likely loser. Instead, the energy sector was the worst-performing sector when Trump was in office, losing 29% even as the S&P 500 surged 83%. Meanwhile, the clean-energy sector rose 306% during Trump's presidency, according to data from YCharts. When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, many investors viewed the traditional energy sector as a likely loser because of the Democrats' typical unfriendliness toward oil companies, while clean-energy stocks were seen as likely winners. Today, the opposite is true: Traditional energy stocks have been the best-performing sector during Biden's presidency, rising 139%, while the clean-energy sector is the worst-performing sector, down about 55%. \"Even directed policies have sometimes had opposite outcomes vs expectations,\" Subramanian said, adding: \"There are nuances.\" This time around, Subramanian said investor expectations of stock-market implications based on who wins the presidency could once again fall flat. For example, while a Republican sweep of the White House and Congress may be viewed as favorable for Tesla stock, as CEO Elon Musk has warmly embraced Trump and the Republican Party, it could be a negative because electric-vehicle tax credits would likely be at risk. Ultimately, Subramanian and her team expect the stock market to rise in 2025 regardless of who wins the election in November. That's because she expects 13% year-over-year growth in the S&P 500's earnings per share next year, and profit growth has historically been the biggest driver of stock-market gains.   ",

        "body": "Despite significant fluctuations in Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales, particularly in the Chinese and European markets, Japan’s BEV market has been stable without experiencing sharp increases or declines in BEV sales in recent years. In 2023, Passenger Car BEV sales in Japan increased by 50% to 89k units, accounting for 2.2% of all Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales. Although this volume is relatively small compared to the overall market size, with the share remaining around 1-2% of total PV sales, BEV sales in Japan have been gradually increasing since 2018, when they totalled 27k units and represented 0.6% of the market. The increase in BEV sales in 2022-23 can primarily be attributed to the launch of new Kei car BEVs, specifically the Nissan Sakura and Mitsubishi eK X EV. Nonetheless, certain factors discourage Japanese consumers from purchasing BEVs. Three key ones are high vehicle prices, concerns regarding battery durability, and range anxiety. Kei car BEVs can mitigate these disadvantages, increasing their sales over the past two years. One typical use for Kei cars is daily commuting within the city. They are not intended for long drives, but rather for trips to work, school, and daily shopping. For these purposes, Kei car BEVs are convenient. If users charge the battery at night, there is no need to refuel at public charging stations. However, two years after these Kei car BEVs launched, their sales have begun to stabilise. Recognising the potential of Kei car BEVs in the Japanese market, Japanese carmakers plan to introduce new models, starting with Commercial Kei BEVs. These models were initially scheduled for launch earlier this year, but their introduction has been postponed by several months due to the need for additional preparation time. Notably, Daihatsu faced challenges related to vehicle testing irregularities earlier this year, which limited their ability to allocate sufficient resources to new models, including Kei BEVs. Over the next few years, Japanese BEV sales will likely continue their slow growth. In the meantime, hybrid models remain popular. Sales of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) are also expected to grow gradually. It will be many years before we know which vehicle type will dominate the Japanese market.

They identify Big Money signals. The BMI is a 25-day moving average of those signals netted, with the ultimate output being a ratio of buys to sells. When the BMI is between 0% and 25%, selling is rampant. These rare periods don’t last long and tend to precede broad market rallies. It’s one of the most powerful risk-on signals you’ll find. At the other extreme, a BMI above 80% means we’ve entered a period of runaway buying. Periods like this can last longer – 22 days on average, but sometimes 80 days or more – and come before pullbacks. One year ago, extreme oversold conditions ignited a rally for the ages. Today, stocks are in the rare overbought zone. Stocks go from oversold to overbought – what a year! For those keeping score, both the S&P 500 (represented by the exchange-traded fund SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)) and Nasdaq 100 (represented by the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)) are both up 35% since. But now stocks are overbought. Since 2018, the BMI has produced seven oversold readings and 10 overbought readings: The BMI has gone from oversold (point seven above) to overbought for a second time (point 10 above) in a year. Again, the market rose 35% in that time. But what happens now? Once the BMI drops – and it will eventually – dips tend to occur: It’s simple: when the tide goes out, equity prices fall. In fact, large- and small-cap stocks (represented by the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR)) are negative on average up to two months after the BMI leaves overbought territory: The chart above will come in handy once the BMI signals the bid for stocks is fading. Keep it close so you can keep your mind focused on the long-term prize – painful drops are when opportunity arises! Congratulations if you stuck with stocks the past year. An extreme reading (oversold BMI) lit a monster rally. Now we’re in the overbought area. If you’re new to the MAPsignals process and missed out on the outstanding gains the last year, don’t fret. As I showed in this piece, a buying opportunity is likely near. You just need a MAP to see it! Let the BMI be your guide.

        "body": "The exceptional stock market performance of the past ten years could be replaced by a decade of markedly lower returns, according to Goldman Sachs. During the next ten years, the S&P 500 (which reflects the broader market) could yield a nominal annualized return of 3%, analysts at the investment bank predicted in a note from Oct. 18. The analysts placed a negative 1% annualized nominal return at the low end of the range of likely outcomes, while a 7% return represented the upper bound. Yet, even the high end of the analysts’ range of estimates pales in comparison to the above-average 13% annualized total return the market has experienced during the last decade. “Investors should be prepared for equity returns during the next decade that are towards the lower end of their typical performance distribution relative to bonds and inflation,” the analysts wrote in the note. The Goldman analysts also penciled in a 72% chance the S&P 500 will underperform bonds during the next decade, while they pegged the odds of the stock market index underperforming inflation at about a third. There’s also a 4% chance stocks post a negative absolute return over the period, the analysts wrote. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com Goldman’s lower stock market return outlook for the next decade was influenced in part by its estimate that the U.S. GDP will contract over four quarters during the next ten years, or about 10% of the time. Another factor is the volatility risk that comes from a market heavily dependent on a handful of stocks. The market cap of the 10 largest companies on the S&P 500 account for more than a third of the overall index, the analysts wrote. Their annualized return estimate would be several percentage points higher were they not to account for how highly concentrated the index is, the note read. “As sales growth and profitability for the largest stocks in an index decelerate, earnings growth and therefore returns for the overall index will also decelerate,” the analysts wrote. Goldman’s lower returns forecast is below the consensus 6% average annualized return other market participants are expecting over the same period, and the analysts warned the estimate of many long-term investors like corporate and public pension plans are possibly too optimistic.

        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Tuesday, as a selloff in bonds pushed Treasury yields higher, pressuring rate-sensitive stocks, while investors awaited a deluge of corporate earnings for a clearer market direction. At 5:05 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were down 138 points, or 0.32%, U.S. S&P 500 E-minis were down 21.5 points, or 0.36%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 92.5 points, or 0.44%. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, as investors gauged the impact of the upcoming presidential election on fiscal policy, while reassessing the effect of a robust American economy on the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory. [MKTS/GLOB] The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose as high as 4.222%, continuing a steady climb higher since early October, after a bumper jobs report led investors to dial back expectations for monetary policy easing through the year. Traders are pricing in an 89% chance of a 25-basis-point interest-rate cut in November, according to CME's FedWatch. Rate-sensitive megacap stocks slipped in premarket trading, with Tesla down 0.7%, Apple falling 0.3% and Nvidia losing 0.5%. The primary focus, however, remained on corporate earnings, with more than 100 companies set to report this week. General Motors, 3M and Verizon are among those scheduled to report before the bell, while Baker Hughes and Texas Instruments are awaited after market close. BCA Research analysts said they expected third-quarter earnings to be strong enough to support hopes for a soft landing for the economy. \"Earnings season will also provide useful information on the US economy and consumer spending, the global growth slowdown, and the breadth of earnings growth outside of the mega-cap names.\" Stocks retreated from record highs on Monday, as investors took a breather following six consecutive weeks of advances for major indexes, although gains in Nvidia helped the Nasdaq edge higher. While indexes have rallied on the back of upbeat data and a favorable monetary policy outlook, the next few weeks are likely to be a volatile ride for equity markets, as investors assess earnings, fresh economic data and the results of the U.S. election in two weeks, followed by a central bank meeting. Estimated third-quarter year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 is 6.5% excluding the Energy sector and 4% overall, according to LSEG data. Futures tracking the economically sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 lost 0.6%. Remarks from Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker are expected later in the day.

        "body": "By Alexander Marrow (Reuters) -Amsterdam-based Nebius Group closed 5.6% higher on Monday, recovering from huge early losses when trading for the first time since February 2022, as the AI infrastructure firm's Nasdaq listing, formerly held by Yandex, often dubbed \"Russia's Google\", went live. Trading was suspended soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when the stock traded under Yandex's ticker through its Amsterdam-based parent company. In July, Nebius emerged following a $5.4 billion deal to split Yandex's Russian and international assets. The stock, which had last traded at $18.94 per share in February 2022, slumped 26% in pre-market trading, but recovered all losses to gain 5.6% on the day and close at $20 per share. Yandex once reached a market capitalisation of more than $30 billion, but with revenue-generating businesses in online search, advertising and ride-hailing siphoned off in Russia, Nebius, which targets a slice of the growing AI cloud market, presents a very different proposition. With a free float of 78.1%, mainly held by Western investors and funds, extremely high volatility is likely in the first few days, said Denis Buivolov, a personal investor in Nebius and head of research at BCS' venture capital and pre-IPO department. In an analysis published on financial website Seeking Alpha, Buivolov valued the company at $4.6 billion, or $23 per share, based on company plans and comparisons with firms such as CoreWeave, Lambda Labs and Sacra. Dr Jan-Oliver Strych, adviser to his family fund which invested in Nebius, said the stock's value would be determined by the positive liquidity shock from hyped AI investor demand versus the negative impact of impatient sellers. Nebius, whose core business involves providing Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI cloud as services, is anticipating sharp growth in those markets in coming years. The company expects its revenue to grow by three to four times in 2025 to $500-$700 million, it said on Friday, as it plans to spend between $600 million and $1.5 billion on capital expenditure to increase capacity at data centres in Finland, France and North America.

Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes Waaree Energies Ltd. is valued at $5 billion at the upper end of its price range of 1,427 rupees to 1,503 rupees. Its shares, which have attracted investments from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc., and Morgan Stanley, will start trading next week. The IPO drew strong demand from small and wealthy investors, with the 21.1 million shares on sale getting oversubscribed little over two times as of 2:12 p.m. in Mumbai. This underlines the frenzy for new issuances in a country that’s been a global hotspot for dealmaking in recent months. The backing by prominent Wall Street names underscores the appeal of India’s renewable sector, where stocks have rallied as much as 357% this year. Six of the top 10 best performers on Bloomberg’s World Energy index are Indian firms, including the gauge’s top performer. “Renewables is a large opportunity in India for the next three years,” said Ramesh Mantri, chief investment officer for equities at WhiteOak Capital Asset Management Ltd. The public offering aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal to boost renewable energy production to 500 gigawatts by the end of the decade — a more than two-fold increase from now. The sector may need investments of $2.2 trillion by 2050, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. Still, there are challenges. This space has been struggling with high leverage due to its rapid growth rate and weak cash flows, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report. Meanwhile, the country is still boosting investments in thermal power projects to meet its booming energy demands. That hasn’t stopped the company’s shares from fetching a premium of 1,480-1,510 rupees over the price band in the country’s gray market, according to brokers aware of the deals, who didn’t want to be identified as the information is private. In the unregulated gray market trading, investors enter into informal contracts to trade shares at a pre-determined price before their actual debut. “With solar energy emerging as a key global theme in the transition to renewable energy, Waaree Energy is best placed to capitalize on the growing opportunity,” Shiwani Kumari, an analyst at Monarch Networth Capital, said in a recent note.

        "body": "Tesla (TSLA) has underperformed over the past few weeks following a disappointing production report and negative market reactions to its long-awaited Robotaxi event. As the company prepares to report its Q3 earnings results next week, I maintain a Hold stance on TSLA. I believe that as the market’s attention increasingly shifts to the bottom line, the company’s margins are likely to come under pressure in Q3 due to ongoing headwinds in the auto industry. This could lead to a negative reaction, although some surprises may emerge, such as regulatory credits and strong growth in its energy storage business. Tesla is scheduled to report its Q3 earnings on October 23. However, part of my neutral stance ahead of the earnings release stems from the fact that Tesla’s earnings day often feels less impactful. The company provides its production and delivery results before its financial reports, giving investors a significant preview of its performance. In early October, the company reported 462,890 deliveries, a 6% increase compared to the same period last year but slightly below analysts’ expectations of 463,310. However, I believe this discrepancy is part of a short- to medium-term trend that investors have come to anticipate. The reasons for not meeting expectations can be attributed to significant macroeconomic pressures, particularly the high interest rate environment, which has affected car sales on financing options—a situation that has only recently started to improve. The auto industry as a whole has faced challenges, with weak sales reports from traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). However, there is more to consider. Tesla’s broader strategic shift towards autonomous ride-hailing and humanoid robots may also be impacting production. Such a significant change in strategy is likely to result in periods of contraction in its traditional electric vehicle deliveries and production numbers. While I view Tesla’s current situation as cautious, one major area where the company seems to hold significant long-term potential is in its AI initiatives, particularly its shift toward autonomous ride-hailing and humanoid robots. The long-awaited Robotaxi event, which had been rescheduled several times, finally took place on October 10. Although I see the event as a pivotal moment for the company’s next stage of growth, the market’s reaction was less favorable, likely due to a lack of detailed information. During the event, Musk announced that the company would begin manufacturing Cybercabs before 2027, but he also acknowledged his tendency to be overly optimistic about timelines.              ",

Gas and liquid handling companies possess the technical know-how and specialized equipment to handle valuable (and sometimes dangerous) substances. Lately, water conservation and carbon capture–which requires hydrogen and other gasses as well as specialized infrastructure–have been trending up, creating new demand for products such as filters, pumps, and valves. On the other hand, gas and liquid handling companies are at the whim of economic cycles. Consumer spending and interest rates, for example, can greatly impact the industrial production that drives demand for these companies’ offerings. The 12 gas and liquid handling stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9%. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. In light of this news, gas and liquid handling stocks have held steady with share prices up 3.9% on average since the latest earnings results. Powering fluid dynamics since 1934, Gorman-Rupp (NYSE:GRC) has evolved from its Ohio origins into a global manufacturer and seller of pumps and pump systems. Gorman-Rupp reported revenues of $169.5 million, flat year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 3.8%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. Scott A. King, President and CEO commented, “Incoming orders have continued at a solid pace and on a year-to-date basis are up over 6% compared to the first half of last year, resulting in an increase in backlog since the end of 2023. In addition, our pricing strategies contributed to improved gross margin and increased adjusted earnings. We are focused on top line growth through backlog reduction in the second half of the year, as well as delivering strong gross margin and earnings. We are also pleased that our previously announced refinancing is expected to result in significant interest savings going forward.”                     ",

        "body": "By Andrew Mills, Marwa Rashad, Emily Chow and Yuka Obayashi (Reuters) - Qatar is finding it hard to agree new deals to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan and South Korea as rising competition from the U.S. and elsewhere with more flexible contract terms challenges Doha's decades-old dominance of the market. Qatar was once the top LNG supplier to Japan and South Korea, but buyers are showing preference for supplies from the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. These suppliers all offer shorter-term contracts and unlike Qatar do not restrict the cargoes' final destination. This gives buyers flexibility to sell cargoes elsewhere in the future if they no longer need the cargoes. Negotiations between Japanese and South Korean buyers and Qatar have stalled over Qatar's insistence on destination clauses, the sources said. \"The Qataris try to achieve a lot in how they sell their LNG, in terms of retaining control over the market, whereas (others such as) the UAE's ADNOC and Oman are kind of happy to just get a good price,\" a senior trading source said. \"ADNOC has taken advantage of the current situation, which is that people want diversification of supply,\" the source added. If state-owned QatarEnergy (QE) does not sign new agreements with Japan and South Korea - the world's second and third largest LNG importers after China - Qatar's role would be further diminished. It was knocked off the top spot as global LNG supplier by the United States in 2023. Qatar's major 4.92 million tons-per-year deal to supply Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) expires this year. Another 2.1 mtpa supply deal expires in 2026, official data showed. QatarEnergy said it does not comment on market speculation. Japan's LNG demand is falling due to nuclear reactor restarts, more renewable energy and a slowing economy. Imports fell to 66 million metric tons in 2023, from 83 tons in 2018, Japan customs data shows. Qatar's market share in Japan fell to 4% in 2023 from 12% in 2018. Meanwhile, the United States' share in Japan rose to 8% from 3% during the same period. Qatar's share of South Korea's market fell to 19% in 2023 from 32% in 2018, with Australia's share rising to 24% from 19% and Malaysia's growing to 13% from 8% in the same period, data from consultancy Energy Aspects showed. TOUGH TALKS QatarEnergy is working to sign deals to supply European and Asian buyers with fresh supplies of LNG expected to come onstream from its North Field expansion, which will boost its overall production by 85%.

As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 13.8% below. The Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. In light of this news, leisure facilities stocks have held steady with share prices up 4.5% on average since the latest earnings results. Owner of CycleBar, Rumble, and Club Pilates, Xponential Fitness (NYSE:XPOF) is a boutique fitness brand offering diverse and specialized exercise experiences. Xponential Fitness reported revenues of $76.52 million, down 1.1% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 8.5%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates. “During my first six weeks, I’ve enjoyed the opportunity to meet with many of our dedicated franchisees and employees,” said Mark King, CEO of Xponential Fitness, Xponential Fitness delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 24.8% since reporting and currently trades at $12.80. Read our full report on Xponential Fitness here, it’s free. With over 150 locations and gyms that include saunas and steam rooms, Life Time (NYSE:LTH) is an upscale fitness club emphasizing holistic well-being and fitness. Life Time reported revenues of $667.8 million, up 18.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 5.2%. The business had a stunning quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ same-store sales estimates.                 ",

Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says The S&P 500 Index (^GSPC) will approach 6,000 by year-end — a record milestone 2.3% above Friday’s close — based on the median estimate from 411 questionnaire participants. Three quarters of respondents expect this earnings season to give the benchmark a boost, and the strength of Corporate America’s results are seen as more crucial for the stock market’s performance than who wins the November vote or even the Federal Reserve’s policy path. US stocks face a big earnings hurdle this week, with roughly 20% of S&P 500 members scheduled to release results, including heavyweights Tesla Inc (TSLA). and IBM (IBM). About 70 companies in the gauge have reported already, with 76% announcing earnings that surpassed estimates, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. After Tesla, the other so-called Magnificent Seven members report starting later this month. Those technology behemoths — Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META) — have driven the brunt of the equities advance since last year. But they trailed last quarter as the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since 2020, supporting sectors like financials and utilities. Survey takers anticipate the tech giants will take the lead again. A combined 75% expect the Magnificent Seven to either beat or perform in line with the rest of the market this quarter, after the group started October with a 0.9% decline. One reason investors remain bullish is that the bulk of the S&P 500’s earnings growth still comes from the Magnificent Seven. “The catch-up in the Magnificent Seven after a lackluster quarter is a compelling trade to look at right now,” said Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital. The median survey respondent sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 5,977, up from Friday’s close of about 5,865. That would extend the index’s 23% gain in 2024, which has taken it to 47 record closing highs, including two last week.                ",

        "body": "A former owner of a pet shop and mahjong parlors in Japan has invested his way to eight figures — and earned the nickname Japan’s Warren Buffett. At 88, Shigeru Fujimoto of Kobe is photographed clad in unassuming pullovers while he sits before three computer monitors. But don’t be fooled. This octogenarian, much like the Oracle of Omaha, has invested for decades: since age 19, according to The Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper. He became a full-time investor in 1986 and a day-trader in 2015. He is famously frugal, too. Just as Buffett drives a 10-year-old Cadillac XTS, Fujimoto gets by without a cellphone or car. “My goal is Warren Buffett,” Fujimoto told the outlet. With a net worth of $14 million, per Bloomberg, he still has a very, very long way to go, given that Buffett’s net worth is an estimated $143.2 billion as of early October. Yet you can’t help but notice similarities. Buffett is 94, just six years Fujimoto’s senior. Both still keep to ambitious work regiments; Fujimoto begins his \"workday\" at 2 a.m.. And when he speaks, Japanese markets listen. After a regulatory filing revealed he had a stake of more than 5% built up in Storage-Oh Co., which manages storage units, its shares spiked 17%. Fujimoto stands out in a country where cash savings made up more than half of household assets in the second quarter of this year, which is attributed to the deflationary environment. That's over 1 quadrillion yen (15 zeroes) or roughly $7 trillion, according to the Bank of Japan. “It’s no use just remaining cautious and thinking to yourself, ‘Oh, that looks fine,’” Fujimoto said to The Asahim Shimbun, talking about the first time he was introduced to online day trading. “Zero times zero only makes zero. Your world is so small. There are so many things that you don’t know. Age doesn’t matter when you are making a new effort.” In declining health according to Japanese media, there’s a clear desire to learn his secrets before he passes away. A book of his teachings is labeled a bestseller on Amazon Japan. Meanwhile, he remains eager to keep trading, telling The Asahi Shimbun: “I will be retiring when I die.” Fujimoto has earned enough to retire multiple times. If he spent $3800 a day – enough to land a first-class flight, a five-star hotel and chump change for Kobe steaks – it would last him 10 years. He keeps score a different way. He rates his life “a 75 out of 100,” adding: ”I will go on pursuing the perfection of spirit, techniques and physical fitness, and my life may improve to 90 or 100 points.”       ",

As always, the key is identifying stocks poised to deliver solid returns, and Bank of America has highlighted strong choices for those seeking high-growth opportunities. BofA’s analysts aren’t limiting their focus to just one part of the market; they are looking across sectors at a diverse group of stocks – and they are looking ‘under the hood’ to find shares that are ready to jump. With that in mind, we turned to the TipRanks database to review two of Bank of America’s latest stock picks, both of which present strong upside — including one with a potential gain of nearly 390%. In fact, the banking giant isn’t the only one backing these names; both stocks are rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the broader analyst consensus. Let’s take a closer look and find out what the optimism is all about. Werewolf Therapeutics (HOWL) We’ll begin in the world of biotherapeutics, where Werewolf Therapeutics is developing new immunotherapy drugs specifically designed to reduce the common and severe side effects often associated with cancer treatment. The company has created a proprietary development platform, known as PREDATOR, to engineer conditionally activated molecules that stimulate both the adaptive and innate functions of the immune system. With this approach, Werewolf has successfully advanced two drug candidates into clinical trials. Both products are INDUKINE molecules, a proprietary development, and are designed to selectively activate in tumor tissues while remaining inactive in peripheral tissues, a feature intended to reduce the occurrence of unwanted off-target effects while maximizing the anti-tumor immune response. Werewolf’s goal is to create anti-cancer drugs with higher tolerability levels than existing treatments. Werewolf’s lead drug candidate, WTX-124, is being developed to treat solid tumors and is under investigation as both a monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda. The company is enrolling patients in a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter study – a first-in-human trial of the drug. At the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2024, the company shared new interim results from the monotherapy dose-escalation arm, along with early data from the combination arm. The latest data highlighted WTX-124’s clinical activity and its overall tolerability in patients. Dose escalation in the combination study section is ongoing, with updated data expected by year-end. The company’s second candidate, WTX-330, is focused on treating advanced or metastatic solid tumors as a monotherapy. Early data from its Phase 1 trial, also presented at ASCO, showed promising outcomes in patients with advanced solid tumors or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Werewolf plans to release further updates later in this quarter.                ",

The Israeli military is continuing its attacks against Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, with hundreds of Beirut residents fleeing their homes late on Sunday as explosions rocked the Lebanese capital. Gold prices surged to a record high on Monday and were little changed at $2,719.33 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.3% higher at $2,738.9. The benchmark S&P 500 and Dow finished lower, with defensive stocks including real estate and healthcare among the leading drags. The Nasdaq closed slightly stronger, with Nvidia finishing at a record high, ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.80%, to 42,931.60, the S&P 500 fell 0.18% to 5,853.98 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.27% to 18,540.01. The European shares index lost 0.66%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.37%. Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.5% lower. \"There's just tension around the earning season kicking off in earnest and then, of course, the elections two weeks away even though we haven't had the typical anxiety over elections that we normally see in September and October,\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California. Oil prices settled up nearly 2% after a more than 7% drop last week. Brent crude futures settled up 1.68% at $74.29 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were 1.94% higher at $70.56 a barrel. Markets are pricing in a 89.3% chance for a cut of 25 basis points (bps) at the Fed's November meeting, with an 10.7% chance of the central bank holding rates steady, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 11.9 basis points to 4.194%. The dollar climbed, buoyed by a rise in U.S. bond yields. The euro was down 0.46% at $1.0815, while the pound weakened 0.51% to $1.2982. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.86% to 150.79. The European Central Bank (ECB) last week cut rates for the third time this year. Data on Monday showed German producer prices fell more than expected in September. The dollar index, which tracks its performance against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro,rose 0.49% to 103.97. \"Between the combination of escalating or still-high Middle East tensions, and we're only a handful of days away from the (U.S. election), it could be that the market is getting nervous ahead of that and people are squaring some of their positions,\" said Wasif Latif, president and chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners.

Inflation will remain low enough to leave room for the Fed to cut interest rates, boosting stocks. The stock market is on track for another year of double-digit gains, according to UBS. Strategists at the bank made a bullish call for stocks in a note on Friday, predicting the S&P 500 would reach 6,600 by the end of next year. That forecast implies around 13% upside from the benchmark index's current levels, and the rise will be fueled by a \"no landing\" for the economy, the firm said. In that scenario, economic growth continues, the job market remains strong, while inflation and interest rates might remain slightly higher than markets had previously expected under a hard landing or a soft landing scenario. \"[T]he bottom line is that the improved US macroeconomic outlook increases our degree of certainty about our positive view of equities. We have upgraded US equities to Attractive from neutral,\" strategists said in a note on Friday, pointing to data that suggested the economy was on a solid bedrock. The job market is proving resilient, despite tighter financial conditions and higher interest rates. The US added 254,000 jobs in September, way more than the expected 147,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The jobless rate, meanwhile, remained near historic lows, with unemployment dipping to 4.1%. Economic activity also remains robust. Retail sales grew an above-expected 0.4% over the month of September, and GDP expanded 3% year-over-year in the second quarter. Inflation, meanwhile, is moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. Consumer prices grew 2.4% annually in September, while personal consumption expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, grew 2.2% year-over-year in August, its lowest reading since 2021. Cooling price growth sets the stage for the Fed to continue cutting interest rates, UBS said, which is bullish for stocks. Markets are pricing in a 72% chance the Fed will cut rates another 50 basis points by the end of year, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. The strategists added that while investors may see some volatility ahead of the November election, it's unlikely to interrupt more positive market catalysts. \"The US presidential election is unlikely to derail positive fundamentals. We expect volatility to rise in the runup to the election as neither party holds a clear advantage in any of the key swing states that will decide the outcome. But the election is taking place against a backdrop of Fed rate cuts, US economic momentum, and supportive secular trends like artificial intelligence (AI),\" the note added.   ",

        "body": "Nvidia has been one of the most hyped and closely followed stocks in recent memory as the fortunes of the broader market increasingly hinge on the AI chip leader. At one point this year, the stock accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500's gains, and some investors even held watch parties for Nvidia's earnings release. Nvidia's astronomical run to a $3 trillion company has also been somewhat divisive as many on Wall Street have doubted that the stock can sustain further gains while others see the AI boom fueling more upside. That's left investors asking, \"Should I buy Nvidia stock right now, or sell it?\" Analysts at Bank of America have an answer: In a note on Thursday, they reiterated their buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised their price target to $190 from $165, implying it could soar 38% higher from Friday's closing price. At $190 a share, Nvidia's market cap would also explode to $4.7 trillion, from $3.4 trillion today. In fact, BofA is so bullish on Nvidia stock that analysts called it a \"generational opportunity,\" estimating a total addressable market of more than $400 billion for AI accelerators. \"AI models (demand) continue to evolve, with the cadence of new LLM model launches now increased to 3-5 times/yr per developer (OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc.), and each new major generation requiring 10-20x compute requirement to train,\" analysts said. Their confidence in Nvidia has been boosted by others in the chip sector like Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML, which both recently signaled strong AI demand. BofA's meetings with executives at Broadcom and Micron as well as comments from AMD have yielded similar indications. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also touted huge demand for the company's next-generation AI chip. “Blackwell is in full production. Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane,” he told CNBC earlier this month. “Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.” Adding to BofA's bullish case for Nvidia is its underappreciated enterprise partnerships with the likes of Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft, and others as well as its software products that help reinforce Nvidia's dominance in hardware. They combine to create a deeper overall Nvidia ecosystem for AI. Plus, Nvidia could generate more than $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, rivaling even Apple, BofA estimated. Earnings reports later this month from tech giants that are developing AI technologies, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, should provide more insight into demand. And Nvidia is due to report Nov. 20.    ",

The yield on 10-year Treasuries added one basis point to 4.21% after an 11 basis-point surge at the start of the week. Investors are paring back their expectations for Fed rate cuts after central bank officials indicated a preference for reducing rates at a slower pace. The inflationary impact of a possible Donald Trump presidential win is also weighing, given his promised tax cuts and trade tariffs could ultimately entail higher rates. “This is very clearly linked to trading a victory of the Republicans — and therefore to an agenda which would be much more inflationist than that of the Democrats. We’re in a market that is betting on Trump,” said Christopher Dembik, senior investment adviser at Pictet Asset Management. “The rise in yields is starting to threaten equity markets.” Bonds Are Selling Off Everywhere as Traders Rethink Fed Pathway Gold rose — approaching Monday’s record high — with haven demand coming from traders focused on the conflict in the Middle East and the looming US vote. Despite the mounting risks, the current winning streak for US stocks ranks among the very best since 1928, according to data compiled by SentimenTrader. Should the S&P close with a loss on Tuesday, it would be the first back-to-back decline in about 30 sessions. According to Citigroup Inc. strategists, exposure to the S&P 500 has reached levels that were followed by a 10% slump in the past. Tough Call Even though US equities are expensive, going underweight is a tough call for investors in the environment where S&P 500 reached 47 record highs this year starting from January, said Vera Fehling, DWS Europe chief investment officer. “If you said then: ‘things are looking quite stretched’ — you would have massively underperformed,” she added. “It’s difficult to explain going into the end of such a year with a significant underweight in US equities.” European equities appear cheap by comparison. So far about 47% of MSCI Europe companies reported results below expectations while only 27% delivered beats, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. L’Oreal is set to report earnings later today, with analysts watching the impact of Chinese economic weakness on the stock.                                                ",

        "body": "Buy the dip. That was the mindset around chip stocks last week as investors scooped up beaten-down shares, sending Nvidia (NVDA) to a record high. A strong outlook for Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was enough to revive Wall Street’s enthusiasm for artificial intelligence as growing confidence in the AI boom overshadowed chip supplier ASML’s sluggish forecast and reports of export caps of advanced AI chips to some Middle Eastern countries. Nvidia closed the week above $138 per share, bringing its market value to $3.39 trillion. The stock was trading a touch higher, up 0.2%, in Monday's premarket trading. It’s now the world's second-largest company behind Apple (AAPL). But that might not be for long. Experts I spoke with this past week say there’s growing confidence the chip giant will be the first Big Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. “There's no question about it,” Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts (video above). “The demand for GPU chips is strong, and you're seeing early adopters starting to get some ROI.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang fueled the stock’s rally earlier this month after describing demand for the new Blackwell chips as “insane.” Even amid the stock’s dramatic outperformance, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Tony Wang told me investors still “continuously underestimate” Nvidia’s growth potential. He sees “exceptional” demand for AI making it “definitely possible” that the chip giant crosses that $4 trillion threshold first. In the coming weeks, earnings from fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" companies will give investors better insight into Nvidia’s market dominance. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), which account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue, have all pledged to continue investing in AI. Last quarter, spending by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft totaled more than $40 billion, while Amazon said spending in the second half of the year will likely surpass the $30 billion spent during the first half. BofA analyst Vivek Arya, who views Nvidia as a “generational opportunity,” cites capital expenditure commentary from top hyperscalers among the reasons that he sees Nvidia \"strengthening its position.\" Arya lifted his price target on the chipmaker to $190 last week, implying a rally of nearly 40% from Friday’s closing price. Arya and his team also cited Taiwan Semiconductor’s robust demand outlook as a positive. TSMC — a top supplier for Nvidia and other giants, including Apple — triggered a sector-wide rally after posting a more than 50% jump in net income for the third quarter and forecasting full-year revenue growth of nearly 30%.

But the country is still relatively new to the sort of funding that many observers associate with the term, with recent growth in involvement of local and global funds focused specifically on strategies including direct lending, special situations and mezzanine finance. Local firms are fueling competition with global giants such Cerberus and Oaktree Capital Management. India’s direct-lending market has yet to come through a full credit cycle and troubles at some players may eventually result in consolidation, according to Cerberus’s Ghosh. For now, India’s central bank chief is relatively sanguine about the outlook for the sector, though he expressed concern from a global perspective. “At the moment, we don’t see the kind of risk which we see at a global scale” for private credit in India, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said at the forum. At the global level, the “robustness and resilience of private credit is yet to be tested” and “every central bank or every regulator should be looking into” the possible risks, he said. The global private credit industry has more than doubled in size to a $1.7 trillion since 2019. The opaque nature of the market is attracting greater scrutiny from regulators, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England as higher borrowing costs weigh on weaker borrowers and trigger more bad loans. Current private debt returns fail to justify the growing risk in private credit, according to Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Mohit Mittal, chief investment officer for core strategies, who was speaking in a Bloomberg Intelligence Podcast. He warned of “more complacency” in private credit.           ",

        "body": "As the Q2 earnings season comes to a close, it’s time to take stock of this quarter’s best and worst performers in the home furniture retailer industry, including Arhaus (NASDAQ:ARHS) and its peers. Furniture retailers understand that ‘home is where the heart is’ but that no home is complete without that comfy sofa to kick back on or a dreamy bed to rest in. These stores focus on providing not only what is practically needed in a house but also aesthetics, style, and charm in the form of tables, lamps, and mirrors. Decades ago, it was thought that furniture would resist e-commerce because of the logistical challenges of shipping large furniture, but now you can buy a mattress online and get it in a box a few days later; so just like other retailers, furniture stores need to adapt to new realities and consumer behaviors. The 4 home furniture retailer stocks we track reported a strong Q2. As a group, revenues missed analysts’ consensus estimates by 1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 7.2% below. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal recently, leading the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent or 0.5%) in September 2024. This is the first cut in four years. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be debating whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Thankfully, home furniture retailer stocks have been resilient with share prices up 8.9% on average since the latest earnings results. With an aesthetic that features natural materials such as reclaimed wood, Arhaus (NASDAQ:ARHS) is a high-end furniture retailer that sells everything from sofas to rugs to bookcases. Arhaus reported revenues of $309.8 million, flat year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 1.4%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings estimates but a miss of analysts’ gross margin estimates. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 32.7% since reporting and currently trades at $9.32. Is now the time to buy Arhaus? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.

Block’s comments come amid renewed investor optimism toward the cohort of the top technology names — Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. — after a lackluster quarter when the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cut spurred a rotation into other sectors. The S&P 500 just capped a sixth straight week of gains thanks to a slew of solid corporate earnings and signs the world’s largest economy is holding up. The US benchmark gauge has notched 47 closing records this year, with nearly one third of its constituents notching 52-week highs last week. “As long as the labor market is reasonably strong in the US — which it is — you’re not going to see outflows,” he said. “You’re just going to continue to see inflows, especially in those most heavily weighted names in the S&P 500.” Meanwhile, Block reiterated his aversion toward China, a market he has been calling “uninvestable.” A long-time China skeptic and one of the most famous short sellers when it comes to the Asian nation’s stocks, he has instead preferred investing in Vietnam, where Muddy Waters has launched a long-only fund. Despite a recent rally spurred by Beijing’s stimulus blitz, Block said the issues of corporate governance, policy “capriciousness” and geopolitical issues remain big hurdles. “From a medium to long term perspective, I once again just still fail to see how having money committed to China makes sense,” Block said, adding that he doesn’t have an opinion on China on a short-term basis.

That’s not what the industry wants you to think Housing market report: 10 states where home prices have risen more than 600% since 1984 Over the past 40 years, U.S. home prices as tracked by the Freddie Mac House Price Index, have soared a staggering 494%. The 10 states with the biggest home price gains between March 1984 and March 2024 were Washington (828%), Oregon (699%), Rhode Island (668%), Massachusetts (664%), California (664%), Hawaii (639%), Utah (610%), Montana (608%), Idaho (607%), Maine (605%). During that 40-year span, overall inflation rose 203%, while median U.S. household incomes rose 233%. Despite the significant disparity between national home price growth and inflation/median incomes, housing affordability is a different story. Traditional housing affordability measurements—taking into account mortgage rates, median incomes, and national home prices—show that in 2024, the situation is only marginally worse than it was for national housing affordability in 1984. This is especially true for buyers who are financing their housing market purchases (although, those who could afford to pay all-cash in 1984 had a considerable advantage over all-cash buyers in 2024). The reason that 1984 and 2024 housing affordability are closer than incomes and prices alone suggest? Mortgage rates. In 1984, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was between 13.0% to 15.0%, whereas in 2024, it hovers around 7.0%. Of course, if you consider other factors like property taxes, home insurance, and down payment size, that could make 2024 housing affordability a little worse than traditional affordability metrics suggest. It's important to note that state-level home prices did not rise upward in a perfectly straight line over the past four decades; there were bumps along the way. And just because national home prices have soared by 494% over the past 40 years doesn’t mean the next 40 years will look the same.

Let’s take a look at how electrical systems stocks fared in Q2, starting with Atkore (NYSE:ATKR). Like many equipment and component manufacturers, electrical systems companies are buoyed by secular trends such as connectivity and industrial automation. More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products. The 14 electrical systems stocks we track reported a satisfactory Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. After much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much. Luckily, electrical systems stocks have performed well with share prices up 10.9% on average since the latest earnings results. Protecting the things that power our world, Atkore (NYSE:ATKR) designs and manufactures electrical safety products. Atkore reported revenues of $822.4 million, down 10.5% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with underwhelming EBITDA guidance for the full year and a miss of analysts’ operating margin estimates. “Atkore delivered Adjusted EBITDA margins over 25% on essentially flat volume compared to the prior year,” said Bill Waltz, Atkore President and Chief Executive Officer. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 24.8% since reporting and currently trades at $89.03. Read our full report on Atkore here, it’s free.

        "body": "With the presidential election in less than three weeks, you may be wondering about the impact the result will have on stocks. To some extent, the election outcome doesn’t matter. The S&P 500 has risen in 39 of the past 50 years, generating an average annual return of 11.9%, including dividends. 🐂 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 🐻 So, if history repeats itself, stocks should do well for whoever wins the presidency. To be sure, the market has done better with Democratic presidents than Republican ones. According to Ned Davis Research, from 1901 to 2024, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed an annualized 8.2% under Democratic presidents and 3.2% under Republican administrations. Perhaps that means Democratic presidents have implemented superior economic policy compared to Republicans. But it seems likely to me that much of the difference is random. The makeup of Congress shows the opposite result. With a Democratic-controlled Congress, the DJIA has gained an annualized 1.1% when adjusted for inflation. However, with a Republican Congress, the increase is 6.5%. Again, I think the results are more random than a reflection of the superior economic policy passed by GOP-led Congresses. Looking at the current market environment, some experts say a Trump victory has already been priced into the strong stock market. They think he would implement business-friendly policies that are good for stocks. Related: Major Wall Street firm lays out extreme possibility for S&P 500 in 2025 The betting odds of Trump becoming president have risen to 56%, according to data from several sources cited by JPMorgan Chase. Meanwhile, the odds of a GOP majority in the Senate have risen above 80%, and the odds of a Democratic House have slid from over 60% to around 55%. “The rising probability of a Republican sweep is seen in the market moves over the past two weeks,” Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director for global market strategy at JPMorgan, wrote in a commentary. Those moves include stronger stocks, particularly bank stocks, a stronger dollar, and higher U.S. bond yields. But market levels don’t imply as high a probability of a Republican presidency/Congress sweep as the 45% probability implied by betting markets, he said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 344.31 points, or 0.80%, to 42,931.60, the S&P 500 lost 10.69 points, or 0.18%, to 5,853.98. The Nasdaq Composite gained 50.45 points, or 0.27%, to 18,540.01, boosted by the chip heavyweight Nvidia, which rose 4.14% to close at a record high of $143.71. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury jumped as high as 4.17%, a 12-week high. \"The rise in the 10-year yield is causing confusion that maybe the economy is growing too rapidly and that employment remains too resilient,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"As a result, the Fed might end up being slower to lower interest rates.\" On Friday, the Dow and the S&P 500 both closed at record highs as all three major indexes posted a sixth consecutive week of gains, their longest winning streak this year. Many rate-sensitive megacap technology stocks slipped. Tesla was down 0.84%. After a fairly upbeat start to earnings season, the focus was on the 114 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report this week. These include Tesla, Coca-Cola and Texas Instruments. Ahead of a busy week for earnings, some investors likely took some profits, according to analysts. David Laut, chief investment officer at Abound Financial, said the market was looking at how stretched valuations are. Of companies that have reported so far, 83.1% beat earnings estimates, according to data compiled by LSEG on Friday. Monday's declines were broad, with almost all 11 major S&P 500 sectors in the red. The rate-sensitive Real Estate sector dropped 2.08% as yields rose, while the technology sector was lifted by the jump in Nvidia. The economically sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 dropped 1.61%. Investors also looked ahead to the U.S. presidential election, with polls showing chances improving for former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate.

As of June 30, 2024, the company operated 50 pharmacies that served approximately 174,000 residents in approximately 6,700 LTCFs across 36 states. Guardian Pharmacy Services priced its initial public offering of 8 million shares at $14.00 per share. The company started trading on September 26. Truist notes the sizable market opportunity of around $24.8 billion of U.S. institutional pharmacy revenue in 2024. The analyst observes strong industry trends driven by the aging U.S. population and an increase in residents at assisted living facilities, along with a rise in chronic conditions and multiple diagnoses. “Given these industry dynamics, we view Guardian as well positioned given their differentiated scale, suite of capabilities,” Truist analyst writes. The analyst sees a market share of over 12%, with a leading presence in many regions and an impressive assisted living resident adoption rate of approximately 88%. The analyst adds that Guardian has strategically targeted the more lucrative markets of assisted living and behavioral health facilities/group homes. The analyst initiates with a Buy rating and a price target of $22. Truist says the industry dynamics are advantageous, as the market is notably fragmented, and regulatory requirements create significant barriers to entry. Additionally, demographic trends are likely to provide a boost, particularly as the aging population increasingly relies on prescription medications. Stable margins have accompanied Guardian’s rapid membership growth, and the company’s strong cash flow and appealing financial flexibility will enable continued investments in growth and M&A, the analyst says. Lastly, Truist foresees ongoing expansion efforts in new and established markets via organically and M&A activities. Price Action: GRDN stock is down 1.13% at $17.48 at last check Monday.

        "body": "By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Investors are leaving exchange-traded funds tied to specific themes, such as artificial intelligence and video gaming, as they flock to funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks that are hitting record highs. The run for the exits, however, may slow if the broader market stumbles. While flows in equity ETFs overall continue to climb, thematic ETFs, which invest in companies tied to everything from solar energy to robotics and millennial consumers, are on pace for their third-consecutive year of net outflows, according to financial data and analysis company Morningstar. The category, which has total assets of $108 billion, has lost $5.8 billion in investor capital this year, greater outflows than the $4.8 billion for all of 2023, according to Morningstar. \"It's winter for thematic ETFs right now,\" said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs, an asset-management firm focused on this category. Returns from broad market indexes are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. The S&P 500, the benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has climbed over 22% this year, propelled by gains from influential stocks including Nvidia and Meta Platforms. The five-largest ETFs tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, another equity benchmark, have seen inflows of $170 billion this year. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust on Thursday became the first ETF to reach $600 billion in assets. \"It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out,\" said Aniket Ullal, ETF analyst at CFRA, a market-research firm. BAD TIMING Part of the challenge, said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar, is the nature of thematic investing itself. Investors often mistime investing in themes, according to a Morningstar study that found investors in thematic ETFs missed out on two-thirds of their returns in a five-year period. \"You have to pick the right theme, then be sure that the fund has picked the stocks that will benefit most from that theme, and then be right about the timing of when you buy the fund,\" Armour said. \"Getting that trifecta right is tough.\" Even some AI-themed ETFs with outsized exposure to market-darling Nvidia have struggled to retain assets. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF has seen net outflows of $89 million in the last 12 months, according to the firm. Despite the fund having nearly 13% of its portfolio in the AI chipmaker - almost double the S&P 500 weighting - it has performed only in line with the index, with both up about 39% in the past year.

He views any potential pullback as a \"buy the dip\" opportunity. The stock market looks poised for a 7% correction by mid-November, according to technical analyst Mark Newton of Fundstrat. Newton told clients in a note on Thursday that he is expecting the S&P 500 to see weakness heading into November as investor sentiment hits complacent levels just ahead of the general election on November 5. \"While intermediate-term bullish these remains very much intact, it's doubtful that US Equities continue to push up into and post-election without any consolidation,\" Newton said. Newton said the potential correction he expects in the stock market is likely to be a \"short-term correction only\" and \"not the start of a larger decline,\" playing into Fundstrat's Tom Lee's consistent message that investors should view any decline in the stock market as a \"buy the dip\" opportunity. Newton is monitoring the 5,900 level on the S&P 500 as potential resistance for the index. The S&P 500 traded at around 5,850 on Friday. \"The issues with near-term complacency (as judged by low Equity put/call levels), waning breadth, poor seasonal trends and cyclical projections for November as well as SPX's largest sector, Technology, not performing well of late, are all reasons to be alert for possible trend change in the weeks to come,\" Newton explained. One \"key reason\" Newton is turning bearish in the short-term is that the current rally in stocks that started in early August is 88 days long, which is exactly how long the April 19 to July 16 rally lasted before a sell-off materialized. From a time perspective, that's \"why this rally might 'run out of steam,\" Newton said. Other areas of technical weakness that Newton is monitoring includes negative divergences in momentum as measured by the RSI and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators, a lack of bearish investors as measured by the AAII investor sentiment data, and seasonal cycles that show a peak in the stock market in mid-to-late October followed by a sell-off through November. \"This market has seemingly 'dodged a bullet' thus far during one of the historically worst periods during most election years. However, investors should not take this to mean that the coast is clear for an interrupted rally higher all year,\" Newton said. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

        "body": "On Thursday, China unveiled new measures to prop up its struggling property market. The measures include quicker credit for developers and support for renovations in urban shantytowns. But analysts say the new measures aren't enough to solve the market's structural challenges. China officials have directed a wave of stimulus measures at the country's beleaguered property market, but the effort hasn't done much to impress Wall Street experts. On Thursday, China unveiled new measures to prop up its flailing housing market, including quicker access to credit for developers and renovations in run-down urban areas. The government's \"white list\" of unfinished housing projects eligible for government financing will now receive more funds to encourage banks to increase lending to those projects, the Ministry of Housing said in a press conference. The funds will amount to 4 trillion yuan ($550 billion) by the end of the year, almost double the current quota of 2.2 trillion yuan. The Housing Ministry also unveiled plans to update the country's run-down downtown areas, or \"urban villages,\" with a million apartment renovations planned. While the efforts appear to be a big swing attempt by Beijing to remedy an issue at the heart of its economic crisis, analysts on Wall Street have been underwhelmed. Experts from Goldman Sachs, BCA Research, and AXA Investment Managers this week struck a pessimistic tone on the potential for the new policies to revive China's property sector. Goldman Sachs analysts said the measures may slightly help real estate financing, home completions, home transactions, and prices in large cities, but they won't be enough to combat the market's structural issues. \"Given many structural challenges in the property sector and still-limited policy support for housing destocking, we maintain our view that there appears no quick fix for the nationwide property sector,\" Goldman Sachs said in a Friday note. Analysts from BCA Research echoed that view, saying the plan's details were \"underwhelming.\" They pointed in particular to the latest aims at the country's \"white list\" project loans, which they say haven't been successful so far amid a fragmented property market and banks' hesitation to lend to risky projects. They also said the apartment renovation plan lacks detail and mirrors a similar program introduced in 2015, which aimed to renovate 6 million units annually for several years. The latest plan, though, provides no clear timeline.          ",

Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen But while Reeves hopes to sell the package to bond markets and voters alike, she and Prime Minister Keir Starmer face a battle convincing cabinet members that they are taking the right approach to the fiscal statement on Oct. 30 that will set the tone for their administration. Senior ministers are in revolt over departmental savings required in a one-year spending review accompanying the budget, with some going over Reeves’ head to write formal protest letters to the premier. Party officials who requested anonymity to discussing internal ructions said the entire cabinet, bar a handful of ultra-loyalists, were at loggerheads with the Treasury, while Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner pressed a standoff with Reeves over spending at least two days past a Wednesday deadline. The dissent presents a fresh challenge to Starmer’s fledgling government, which secured a landslide election win on July 4, but has since become mired in a scandal about ministers accepting freebies and a gloomy narrative about the UK’s economic situation. The test for Starmer and Reeves is to persuade their restless party — which had been in opposition for 14 years — that short-term pain is needed to deliver long-term gains and ultimately reelection in five years’ time. For now, the rebellion has fallen on deaf ears in Downing Street. Starmer and Reeves are united behind the need for difficult immediate decisions on tax and spending in order to fix the foundations of the economy they inherited from the Conservatives, people familiar with their thinking said. Despite cabinet complaints that cutbacks to projects in 2025-26 are tantamount to returning to austerity — the policy of spending cuts pursued by the Tories last decade — Reeves will argue the Conservatives salted the earth by slashing taxes and baking in impossible future public spending cuts in a cynical attempt to hamstring their likely Labour successors.

Most Read from Bloomberg A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says Since the Fed kicked off its long-anticipated loosening cycle on Sept. 18 with a cut of 50 basis points, double the median forecast, emerging-market assets have traded as if borrowing costs in the world’s largest economy will remain high. That’s left developing world assets in limbo and headed for another span of underperformance. In little over a month, the Fed rate cut has been eclipsed by fresh risks that are keeping global investors shy on the asset class, overshadowing the gains that Fed easing cycles might usually be expected to bring. While the threats have taken different forms — higher Treasury yields, a stronger dollar, greater volatility in currency options — the underlying themes have been just two: the potential return of Donald Trump as US president and China’s inadequate stimulus measures. That means that once again, traders in emerging markets are positioning defensively for an inflationary US economy and a deflationary Chinese one. “We remain in a world with two potentially existential threats to EM – China weakness and Trump,” said Paul McNamara, investment director at Gam UK Ltd. in London. “A strong US economy without inflation is good for EM, but persistent inflation will not only postpone further cuts, but weigh on all risk assets into the medium term.” Though there was an initial boost to emerging markets from the Fed move, it was first interrupted by strong US data that revived fears of resurgent inflation, and later comments by presidential candidate Trump that exacerbated them. The Republican nominee has put tariffs and protectionism at the center of his agenda. If implemented, that’s likely to raise consumer prices in the US and undermine demand for exports from the developing world, according to many economists. “We’re just weeks away from a US election that might lead to a Trump economic assault on the biggest EM out there, China,” said Charlie Robertson, head of macro strategy at FIM Partners. “It’s close to a coin flip as to who wins the US election, and equally makes it hard to choose a local markets trade to like.”                               ",

The peculiar sight of a risk-loving rally in U.S. equity markets and corporate high yield debt alongside new records for the traditional safe haven of gold may speak something of the hedged outlook, with geopolitical and electoral risks coloring the booming domestic economy. And with neither candidate for the White House proposing any fiscal retrenchment ahead, trepidation about rising budget deficits during a period of such brisk growth is also adding investor anxiety. The U.S. budget deficit grew 8% to $1.833 trillion for fiscal 2024, the highest outside of the COVID era, as interest on the federal debt exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, the Treasury said on Friday. The shortfall amounted to 6.4% of gross domestic product, up from 6.2% a year earlier. A fiscal think-tank, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, recently estimated that Republican Donald Trump's plans would pile up $7.5 trillion in new debt, more than twice the $3.5 trillion envisaged in Democrat Kamala Harris's proposals. Shifting odds on post-election Congressional math, however, may have much to do with how any of those fiscal plans pan out. At 4.12%, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hovered close to 2-1/2 month highs on Monday even with another quarter-point Federal Reserve interest rate cut still near fully priced for next month. With the Atlanta Fed's real-rime \"GDPNow\" model indicating growth in excess of 3.4% and U.S. economic surprise index at its most positive in six months, the early Q3 earnings season is impressing again with 83% of the 71 S&P500 firms reported beating forecasts. While the blended annual profit growth estimate for the 500 has dipped to 4% from the 5% expected pre-season, according to LSEG data, revenue growth is holding to expectations and a return to brisk double-digit earnings expansions is still forecast for next quarter and right through next year. A heavy diary of updates this week spans industrial, defence, energy and financial sectors but Tesla's quarterly likely grabs many headlines mid-week. Overseas, attention was back on China on Monday as the latest official lending rate cuts there were mostly expected and met with a shrug by markets. The one-year loan prime rate was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.10% from 3.35%, while the five-year LPR was cut by the same margin to 3.6% from 3.85% previously.                ",

Though DOGE remains king of the week, with more than 30% in gains, its modest rise of 2% in a single day may hint at cooling off. Popcat's resurgence coincides with Bitcoin's breakout from the recent four-month slump. Notably, during the first ascension of Bitcoin, POPCAT reached its all-time high of $1.50, but it later settled at $1.37. Meanwhile, DOGE was boosted by investors looking for altcoin exposure and surged to $0.15 amidst the broader market rally. When the price touched $1.23, a local low just days after the all-time high, there was a chunky withdrawal of roughly $4 million worth of POPCAT tokens from exchanges last week. This coordinated movement may indicate accumulation by buyers after a strong DOGE rally. However, technical analysis indicators present a more confusing outlook for POPCAT’s immediate future. While the hourly charts give bearish indications, with the RSI and MACD indicators trending downwards, strong accumulation patterns and probable capital rotation from DOGE may support upward momentum. The established support line at $1.23 seems to sustain itself rather well and might form the ground for future gains. ",

The S&P 500 was up for a sixth straight week. The gauge’s equal-weighted version — one that gives Target Corp. as much clout as Microsoft Corp. — also rose to a record on hopes the rally will broaden out. Netflix Inc. jumped 11% on solid earnings. Apple Inc. climbed 1.2% as sales of its newest iPhones in China soared. American Express Co. sank 3.2% after trimming its revenue forecast. The bulk of the growth in S&P 500 earnings continues to come from megacaps, with the “Magnificent Seven” expected to show an 18% rise in third-quarter profits, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. While the other firms are seen posting an only 1.8% increase in earnings, their results are projected to accelerate to double-digit gains in the first quarter of 2025. “Earnings season is off to the races, and despite some mixed signals, appears to be in good shape,” said Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “We’re in the early innings though, and coming up on the final days before the election and the next Fed meeting. Never a dull moment.” With the odds tilting toward both Donald Trump winning the US presidential election and Republicans controlling Congress, investors have started ramping up assets which had thrived in the wake of the former president’s 2016 victory, according to Bank of America Corp. strategist Michael Hartnett. Price action in the past week shows banks, small caps and the dollar are “front-running 2016 bull moves,” Hartnett wrote in a note. US equities and the greenback surged in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s win over Hillary Clinton in November 2016. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, notching its 47th record in 2024.

Bucking the trend in the equities market was the European heavyweight software company SAP, which surged to an all-time high after raising its full-year targets. The MSCI All-World index ticked 0.2% lower, while U.S. futures pointed to another weaker start open after Monday's drop in the benchmark indices. \"We're getting very close to the U.S. election and the data in the U.S. has been strong. So there is a question about how much the Fed can do,\" said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The chances of the U.S. Federal Reserve delivering a quarter-point rate cut at its Nov. 7 meeting have receded to 87% from near certainty a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch tool. A host of data signalling U.S. economic strength have thrown cold water on bets over another outsized cut, following the Fed's decision to cut rates by half a point in September. Adding to the uncertainty was the looming U.S. election, where former Republican president Donald Trump and Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris are caught in a tight battle to win over some of the more competitive states ahead of the Nov. 5 voting day. Trump's lead in online betting polls has aided the dollar's recent rise to a 2-1/2 month high as his proposed tariff and tax policies could mean stronger inflation and keep U.S. interest rates higher for longer. The dollar index was just below that peak at 103.89. \"As neither party holds a clear advantage in any of the key swing states that could decide the outcome, the race remains too close for pollsters to call, and we expect volatility to pick up in the coming weeks amid elevated uncertainty,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer, UBS Global Wealth Management. Political and geopolitical uncertainty kept safe-haven gold pinned near record levels, up 0.6% at $2,735 an ounce. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose 2 basis points to 4.21%, extending a sharp move higher and hitting their highest since late July.

S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also slid 0.5%, while contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) led the way lower, down about 0.6%. Stocks are coming under pressure amid growing doubts that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut rates aggressively — or even hold steady in November. Strength in the economy, cautious Fedspeak, and concerns about the fiscal impact of an increasingly expected Trump election win are factors in play. Amid the uncertainty, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) steadied above 4.20% after Monday's sharp gains helped push it above that level for first time since July. The bond selling has weighed on rate-sensitive stocks such as real estate, with rising yields typically a catalyst for stock drawdowns. Earnings season picks up pace on Tuesday, with General Motors (GM) the highlight in a rush of reports. 3M (MMM), Verizon (VZ), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) are among the many top-tier results on deck. At the same time, anticipation is building for Tesla's (TSLA) and Boeing's (BA) earnings due Wednesday as both grapple with headwinds.

While a month with no consecutive down days may not sound like much, the current streak ranks among the very best since 1928, according to data compiled by SentimenTrader. “The index remains overbought across multiple time frames and is still vulnerable to profit-taking over the short run,” said Dan Wantrobski, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott. Wall Street faces a big earnings hurdle this week, with roughly 20% of the S&P 500 companies scheduled to report.

        "body": "The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Let’s take a look at how environmental and facilities services stocks fared in Q2, starting with Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK). Many environmental and facility services are non-discretionary (sports stadiums need to be cleaned after events), recurring, and performed through longer-term contracts. This makes for more predictable and stickier revenue streams. Additionally, there has been an increasing focus on emissions and water conservation over the last decade, driving innovation in the sector and demand for new services. Despite these tailwinds, environmental and facility services companies are still at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact commercial construction projects that drive incremental demand for these services. The 13 environmental and facilities services stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 2% below. Big picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled. Thankfully, environmental and facilities services stocks have been resilient with share prices up 6.3% on average since the latest earnings results. Originally founded to focus on Alaska’s oil pipelines, Tetra Tech (NASDAQ:TTEK) provides consulting and engineering services to the water and infrastructure industries. Tetra Tech reported revenues of $1.11 billion, up 12.4% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 2.8%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ backlog sales estimates and optimistic earnings guidance for the full year. Tetra Tech achieved the highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is up 16.2% since reporting and currently trades at $49.76. Is now the time to buy Tetra Tech?

The rapid emergence of new projects can dilute attention, leading to shorter lifespans for most tokens unless they can establish strong communities or unique utilities. Most memecoins rely solely on social media hype, and 97% fail shortly after launch. They often capitalize on media buzz and viral trends to gain rapid traction, but this approach lacks long-term sustainability and viability. As the buzz dissipates, vibrant and dedicated communities provide the much-needed staying power that the hype fails to deliver. Some memecoin projects are finding success with a community-based approach. The team behind LADYS recently announced a new roadmap, which marks a leap forward for its community-building efforts through novel initiatives and features. In fact, LADYS' significant achievements in the memecoin space date from its launch. A mention from Elon Musk on X triggered a notable price surge back in 2023. In 2024, LADYS was one of six memecoins to receive a nomination for CoinMarketCap's memecoin of the year. The second stage of the project's roadmap involved forming community partnerships and a token-gated Discord group, which enabled holders to connect and achieve community growth. In phase 3, the community grew to more than 100,000. The platform is further rolling out its community vision to enhance the memecoin’s visibility and accessibility. Most of the play-to-earn games launched during 2021's NFT craze are conspicously absent from the space. P2E is struggling for a number of reasons, including huge gaps in the tokenomics and playability aspects of NFT-phase Web3 games. Most existing P2E games either lack viable tokenomics or are unplayable, which isn't true for T2E games launched on Telegram. Many complicated on-chain actions are required to participate in P2E games. In comparison, anyone with a Telegram account can play TON ecosystem games. Banana attracted over a million players within 72 hours of being launched, and this number grew to eight million in a month. The T2E model’s ease of playability stands out. To start collecting rewards, a player need only click their device. Completing simple, straightforward tasks comes with additional incentives. These tasks include linking one's socials, joining related communities, and other community-related efforts. The model introduces a balanced rewards approach, reducing the risk of token oversupply.        ",

If approved by fund trustees the plan would expand on prior limitations on exploration and extraction investments by barring future investments in things like pipelines and LNG terminals in funds' private equity and infrastructure portfolios. “Climate risk is financial risk, and we have a fiduciary duty to our beneficiaries to take that risk seriously as we make long-term investment decisions,” Lander said in a statement e-mailed by a representative. Lander, who is running for New York City mayor, oversees a system that has been among the most aggressive in divesting from fossil fuel companies over climate concerns, a cause that has lagged with other public investment institutions. Among other things the main New York City funds have sold out of publicly traded fossil fuel reserve owners, making them \"the first sizable U.S. public pension system that has divested from both its active and passive publicly traded fossil fuel portfolio,\" according to Lander's office.

Brazil’s resources rank eighth globally, well behind Australia, Kazakhstan and Canada. The last assessment of Brazilian reserves took place 40 years ago, but elevated uranium prices are reviving the nation’s ambitions to seek out new deposits. Nuclear Industries of Brazil — or INB — is seeking to collaborate with global companies to carry out new research in regions known for their mineral potential. The state-owned company plans to call for bids from partners interested in exploring areas in Brazil’s northeast, midwest and south by year end. “We aim to move forward 40 years in four,” INB President Adauto Seixas said in an interview. “We have already received visits from companies from Russia, India, Korea, France, Australia, the United States and China.” Brazil’s push comes amid surging interest in uranium, with investors piling into a radioactive metal that underpins a global push to tap carbon-free energy in the form of nuclear power. Uranium prices this year peaked in early February and though they’ve since retreated, levels are still above the historical average. The Brazilian initiative is called the Uranium and Associated Mineral Resources Prospecting and Mining Partnership Program — or Prouranio. Exploration will be in areas that hold other minerals including copper, gold and rare earth elements that occur alongside uranium. INB’s strategy includes mining already mapped areas with help from private firms. Yet, Brazilian minerals research industry group ABPM argues that a partnership model doesn’t suit the private sector, which would want to operate independently. The group’s head, Luis Mauricio Azevedo, suggests that Brazil should open up uranium exploration and development — a move that could help boost global supplies. “If we have the reserves we imagine, Brazil could be a storehouse of energy for the world,” he said.

The Internal Revenue Service detailed the increases in its annual inflation adjustments announced Tuesday. For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately in tax year 2025, the standard deduction is rising to $15,000 — up $400 from 2024. For couples who file jointly, that standard deduction will be $30,000 for 2025, an $800 jump from the year prior. And heads of households will get a $22,500 standard deduction, up $600 from 2024. Income thresholds for all seven federal tax bracket levels were also revised upward. The top tax rate, which remains 37%, will cover incomes greater than $626,350 for single taxpayers in tax year 2025, for example — compared to $609,350 in 2024. The IRS makes such adjustments for each tax year to account for inflation, which has recently been on a downward trend. Last month, inflation in the U.S. dropped to its lowest point in more than three years, marking some encouraging economic news — but Americans are still feeling some key price pressures. “Core” prices, a gauge of underlying inflation, remained elevated in September, driven up by rising costs for medical care, clothing, auto insurance and airline fares. While taxpayers will again see higher standard deductions for 2025, the increases announced Tuesday are less than those seen in recent years. In tax adjustments announced last year, for example, the IRS raised single filers’ standard deduction by $750 between the 2023 and 2024 tax years — and by $1,500 and $1,100 for married couples and heads of households, respectively.

Intesa Sanpaolo is under investigation by prosecutors in the southern Italian city of Bari after it emerged that the accounts of around 3,500 customers, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and former Prime Minister Mario Draghi, might have been violated. The Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic (COPASIR) is closely following the data breach case involving Intesa, the people said speaking on condition of anonymity because such matters are confidential. COPASIR plans to collect information by summoning people who could have relevant information, but at present there are no scheduled hearings for Intesa executives, they added. Intesa issued a public apology for the episode on Oct. 13 after Meloni acknowledged the reported incident in a television interview, saying she expected the judiciary to investigate what happened and any possible conspiracy behind it. The bank's board last week named General Antonio De Vita, a former senior police officer who recently retired from the force, as its head of security, a new division it created after the breach. Banks' IT security is a major concern for the industry's supervisors. Intesa's rogue employee did not hack the system, another person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The employee had clearance to access clients' account data due to their role within the bank. By spreading the access over a period of roughly two years the worker was able to avoid triggering the control system, which would detect, for example, an unusually high number of data requests relating to one account over a short time. The official COPASIR agenda shows a hearing scheduled on Wednesday, Oct. 23 for Cabinet Undersecretary Alfredo Mantovano, a senior government official in charge of intelligence matters. Meetings of the committee are behind closed doors and no minutes of the topics discussed are published. (Reporting by Giuseppe Fonte; Editing by Keith Weir) ",

        "body": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Fishing regulators are delaying a plan for stricter fishing rules amid concerns about a decline in baby lobsters in the warming waters off New England. The regulators are looking to institute a new rule that fishermen need to abide by a larger minimum size for the lobsters they trap. The change is only 1/16th of an inch or 1.6 millimeters, but regulators have said it will help preserve the population of the valuable crustaceans, as many small lobsters will need to be tossed back to the ocean. Some fishermen have argued the change is unnecessary and will be disruptive to one of the country's most lucrative seafood industries when it is already stressed by warming waters, surging expenses and new rules to protect whales. They've argued for the new rules to be delayed or scrapped. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has said the minimum size must be changed because of a recent decline of more than 35% of the young lobster stock in the Gulf of Maine, a key fishing ground. But the commission voted Monday to push back the implementation of the change from Jan. 1 to July 1, 2025. Maine fishermen, who catch most of the country's lobster, remain opposed to the size increase, said Kevin Kelley, a spokesperson for the Maine Lobstermen's Association. However, the delay will help prevent U.S. fishermen from being put at a competitive disadvantage with Canada, which also has a large lobster fishing industry, he said. “We are hopeful that this will provide more time to address unintended consequences of an increase, specifically the fact that unless Canada also changes its gauge size, Canadian lobstermen will still be able to catch smaller lobster,” Kelley said. The size change applies to the Gulf of Maine, where commission officials have said the stock declined by 39% when comparing 2020-22 to 2016-18. Scientists have cited the warming of the Gulf of Maine as a potential stressor for lobsters. The revelation about the decline in young lobsters surprised many in the industry, and some fishermen have questioned the data. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat who represents the Maine coast in Congress and has advocated to block the new rules, called the data “outdated.” The concern about a drop in young lobsters arrived at a time of relative prosperity for the lobster industry. The value of U.S. lobster can fluctuate considerably from year to year, and topped $900 million for the first time in 2021. It remained well over $450 million, which is still a historically high number, last year. The decision to postpone the size requirements will protect the lobster population while also taking into account the market concerns raised by members of the industry, said Patrick Keliher, who is chair of the Atlantic States lobster board as well as commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources. “My hope is that the benefits of the gauge change combined with the increase in young-of-the-year lobsters we’re seeing in the settlement survey will result in a healthy, sustainable resource for future generations,” Keliher said.

He is also unconvinced such a tool would even help ECB messaging. “Given the prevailing evidence, I do not see a compelling case for introducing dot plots for the Eurosystem,” Nagel said at Harvard University on Tuesday. “On the other hand, I firmly believe that we can and should enhance how we account for uncertainty in our macroeconomic projections.” The remarks advance an ongoing debate among ECB officials on how to better frame their quarterly forecasts after a failure to accurately predict the spike in inflation during the pandemic. Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel said earlier this year that dot plots could help in this regard, while acknowledging that they have their own shortcomings. Other officials in the region have also been skeptical. ECB President Christine Lagarde said in July that this option won’t be discussed in a review of the central bank’s strategy that should be completed next year. Nagel proposed a focus on “more effective alternatives.” “One might be to enhance the communication of our existing measures of uncertainty,” he said. “Another might be to develop new measures, such as scenario and sensitivity analyses, as well as improved fan charts. We must carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each approach.” --With assistance from Mark Schroers.

        "body": "Following a string of controversies stemming from technical hiccups and licensing changes, AI startup Stability AI has announced its latest family of image generation models. The new Stable Diffusion 3.5 series is more customizable and versatile than Stability's previous-generation tech, the company claims — as well as more performant. There are three models in total: Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large: With 8 billion parameters, it's the most powerful model, capable of generating images at resolutions up to 1 megapixel. (Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer.) Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo: A distilled version of Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large that generates images more quickly, at the cost of some quality. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium: A model optimized to run on edge devices like smartphones and laptops, capable of generating images ranging from 0.25 to 2 megapixel resolutions. While Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large and 3.5 Large Turbo are available today, 3.5 Medium won't be released until October 29. Stability says that the Stable Diffusion 3.5 models should generate more \"diverse\" outputs — that is to say, images depicting people with different skin tones and features — without the need for \"extensive\" prompting. \"During training, each image is captioned with multiple versions of prompts, with shorter prompts prioritized,\" Hanno Basse, Stability's chief technology officer, told TechCrunch in an interview. \"This ensures a broader and more diverse distribution of image concepts for any given text description. Like most generative AI companies, we train on a wide variety of data, including filtered publicly available datasets and synthetic data.\" Some companies have cludgily built these sorts of \"diversifying\" features into image generators in the past, prompting outcries on social media. An older version of Google's Gemini chatbot, for example, would show an anachronistic group of figures for historical prompts such as \"a Roman legion\" or \"U.S. senators.\" Google was forced to pause image generation of people for nearly six months while it developed a fix. With any luck, Stability's approach will be more thoughtful than others. We can't give impressions, unfortunately, as Stability didn't provide early access. Stability's previous flagship image generator, Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, was roundly criticized for its peculiar artifacts and poor adherence to prompts. The company warns that Stable Diffusion 3.5 models might suffer from similar prompting errors; it blames engineering and architectural trade-offs. But Stability also asserts the models are more robust than their predecessors in generating images across a range of different styles, including 3D art.              ",

For further gains, Chief Executive Officer Fabian Kon says Milei’s administration needs to continue cooling price increases while dismantling regulations and capital controls that he sees holding back investment and growth. “Over the next 10 months, the government needs to get rid of restrictions in the economy. For example, controls on imports and allowing people to obtain foreign currencies,” Kon said in an interview Friday. “If all of that goes well, we’ll see inflation fall and credit increase.” Mortgages in particular represent a key opportunity for Argentina’s top banks to expand their lending portfolios after going dormant in 2018 at the start of the country’s economic crisis. Outside of a brief spike before the downturn, home loans haven’t existed for decades for most prospective buyers, who tend to pay for properties in stacks of US dollar bills. Galicia started offering up to 30-year mortgages this May at a measure of inflation plus 5.5% interest for its customers. “We’re discovering that we’re solving an issue for the first time in Argentina: Someone with a formal job can buy a property,” Kon said of the home loans, adding that 70% of the people who have taken out mortgages are below the age of 40. Galicia is enjoying the renewed wave of optimism in Argentina from Milei’s economic overhaul. Its US-listed shares have delivered 216% in returns to investors so far this year, outperforming more than a dozen other Latin American banks with American depositary receipts over the same span, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also tapped international debt markets this year for the first time since 2016, selling $325 million in bonds at a 7.87% yield, well below Argentina’s sovereign risk level near 1,100 basis points above benchmark US Treasury notes. A sustained demand for loans coupled with a stronger economy, Kon added, would push Galicia to issue even more debt in capital markets locally or abroad. Galicia, which acquired HSBC Holdings Plc.’s operations in the country earlier this year, is Argentina’s largest private bank measured by total assets, currently over $15 billion, according to central bank data.

Armed with $14 million from Nvidia and Boeing, Freeform aims to change that, building a new metal additive printing process that they say changes the game — and yes, there's an AI angle too. Co-founders Erik Palitsch (CEO) and TJ Ronacher (president) both worked at SpaceX, where they were principal architect and lead analyst, respectively, of the Merlin engines and other programs. While there, they saw the potential of 3D printing parts using metal, but also experienced the method's shortcomings firsthand. \"We saw the potential of metal printing; it has the potential to transform basically any industry that makes metal things. But adoption has been slow and success has been marginal at best,\" said Palitsch. \"Why is it not practical to use at scale? Fundamentally, because of three things: crappy and inconsistent quality; speed — commercial printers are very slow; and cost — the price for these printers is astronomical.\" They concluded that if they could operationalize the process to provide a printing service rather than sell a printer, they could crack the whole thing wide open. So they joined up with Tasso Lappas, former CTO of Velo3D, to start Freeform. The primary mistake companies were making was using the likes of CNC machines, which are commonly used in traditional manufacturing, as a model for the metal-printing business. In that case, you sell the machine and its software, and make it work with whatever shapes and processes you use. But metal additive is different, Palitsch said. \"The way these things work today is they're 'open loop' — they're basically playing back a file,\" he explained. \"They needed to be smarter than that, because the process by which you melt metal powder with a laser is extremely complicated, and in a way infinitely variable.\" Selling people a machine and saying \"become an expert to make it work, good luck\" isn't a recipe for success. \"But when you decide you're not going to build and package a printer into a box, when you have the freedom to build an automated factory from clean sheet, there's a lot you can do,\" Palitsch said. Their solution is to provide printing as a service using a closed-loop process in a custom machine that monitors the print on a microsecond scale, adjusting various factors to achieve the kind of print that is expected at a workplace like SpaceX.

Rob Nelson kicked off the discussion, saying, “You are going to be able to tokenize a pretty big property and fractionalize that investment and return opportunity at any scale you want.” He emphasized that tokenization could transform real estate investments, allowing individuals to own property without large upfront costs. Nelson also noted its potential in industries like entertainment and sports, saying, “The dream of tokenization is a lot of people don’t understand how many ways you could apply this.\" Charles Menke expanded on the conversation, noting the historical exclusivity of certain high-value assets. \"Like a Stradivarius or a Mona Lisa, it was strictly owned by the hyper rich always. Tokenization allows assets to be broken into smaller pieces, opening access to middle markets,\" he said. Menke also raised concerns about price volatility, adding, “I'm not sure if it's going to be for the positive or for the negative.” Rob Nelson then introduced the example of the Green Bay Packers, saying, “It's a billion-dollar asset, and you're going to hold it and pass it on to your family members.” He suggested that if ownership was more fluid, it could potentially affect the value, similar to the scenario Menke described with tokenized assets. David Packham offered a different perspective, saying, “There’s a high degree of emotional attachment from the fan base, so they are more likely to treat that less as an investment.” He further explained how tokenization could be structured in a way that wouldn’t necessarily impact the underlying asset, noting, “What you’re really trading is the active value of the asset and providing ways to tap that effectively without impacting the underlying asset at all.” ",

Over at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s asset and wealth-management divisions, analysts offer a more benign outlook. They’re anticipating that US large-cap equities — the big company stocks that have driven much of the recent gains — will remain a pillar of investors’ portfolios and return an annualized 6.7% over the next 10-15 years. While the rally has made prices a bit harder to justify when plotted against earnings — and the bank’s strategists say valuations will eventually need to go down — they anticipate that solid fundamentals will compensate for that. “We want to make sure that people do understand that we are assuming multiple contraction,” Monica Issar, JPMorgan Wealth Management’s global head of multi-asset and portfolio solutions, said at a round-table on Monday. “Multiple contraction will be offset with healthier macro and corporate fundamentals over the next 10 years, and that foundation is a sturdier point in time for investors to allocate capital.” Read: Decade of Big S&P 500 Gains Is Over, Goldman Strategists Say Still, the bank’s estimate for S&P 500 performance trails the long-term average of an annualized 11% since the benchmark’s inception in 1957 through the end of 2023. The diverging forecasts signal the broader uncertainty that’s hovering over Wall Street even after the Federal Reserve’s long-awaited pivot last month toward easing monetary policy.

It's Interface's first outside capital; the startup had been completely bootstrapped. \"Interface is trusted by more than 100 financial institutions across North America, processing millions of interactions every day,\" CEO and co-founder Srinivas Njay told TechCrunch. \"We're generating tens of millions in annual recurring revenue.\" Njay said that the inspiration for Interface came from his father, who owned a credit union in India. Previously, Njay worked at Microsoft as a product manager on the Bing advertising team and at EA as a senior product manager on mobile games. Njay teamed up with Bruce Kim, the founder of customer management and billing company Inovaware, in 2019 to launch Interface. \"The big national banks are investing heavily in AI to transform their banking operations,\" Njay said. \"But for many regional and community-based financial institutions, staffing and resourcing this capability is simply out of reach. Interface democratizes access to AI.\" Interface's core product is a collection of voice- and text-based AI agents designed to handle basic bank customer service requests. Powered by models trained on in-house data, the agents can perform tasks like helping modify mortgage payments and opening new accounts. Banks can customize the agents by fine-tuning them on their internal data. The agents can also be configured to upsell products based on information like the content of prior chats. \"Our AI is specifically designed for the banking industry,\" Njay said, \"complete with pre-built integrations, data models, and workflows.\" Financial institutions are piloting AI — and in particular generative AI — for applications ranging from customer service to predictive analytics. According to a March survey cited in American Banker, more than half of global and U.S. banks intend to implement generative AI at some level over the next year. Besides Interface, AI startups trying to nab a slice of banks' business include Hyperplane, which builds AI models to predict customer behavior; Cambio, which creates AI to talk to a bank's customers; and Digital Onboarding, which specializes in strengthening banks' relationships with customers. Banking customers are wary of the tech, however. In a J.D. Power poll, only 27% said that they'd trust AI for financial information and advice, while less than half said they'd take product recommendations from AI.     ",

Along with the US contribution, the EU, which has approved a loan for up to €35 billion ($37.9 billion), would end up providing at least $20 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The UK announced Monday it will put in £2.3 billion ($3 billion), with Japan and Canada expected to provide similar amounts, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The G-7 aims for initial funds to reach Ukraine by the end of the year, with the bulk of the support being released next year in tranches, the people said. The aid will go toward meeting many of Ukraine’s military and economic needs. The loan plan is an effort to lock in guaranteed funding for Ukraine, as its allies brace for a possible election victory by President Donald Trump, who has been critical of sending US aid to Kyiv. It comes at a crucial time for the country, which has been struggling to hold its defensive lines amid a sustained push by Russia. The people cautioned that the final details of contributions from each nation are still being ironed out and could change before an announcement is made. The G-7 has collectively frozen about $280 billion of Russian central bank assets, with the vast majority of the funds in Europe, where they are expected to generate about $3 billion to $5 billion in profits a year. The loans would be repaid using the proceeds generated by the immobilized funds. G-7 leaders reached a political agreement to provide Kyiv with the loans at a summit in June but have been locked in discussions to finalize a deal since. The US was seeking assurances from the EU that the assets would stay frozen in the longer term but Hungary has blocked changes to the EU’s sanctions regime, arguing that any decisions should wait until after the US election.

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) — Richard N. Winfield, a leading U.S. First Amendment lawyer who represented The Associated Press for three decades and championed freedom of expression for journalists around the world, died on Tuesday. He was 91. Winfield died in his sleep at Bellevue Hospital in New York, said his daughter, Nicole Winfield, who is AP's Rome-based Italy and Vatican correspondent. He had suffered head trauma after a fall on Oct. 7. Winfield served as general counsel for AP for three decades while a partner at the New York law firm of Roger & Wells, which became Clifford Chance US LLP. During that time, he worked closely with American publishers and editors, defending AP as well as other media clients in hundreds of press freedom cases. “When we would ask Dick, as our lawyer, to review a sensitive piece of copy, his first words were often some form of ‘What a great story!'” said Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive officer of the AP from 1985-2003. “And then we would go through the story, not to weaken it but to strengthen it against whatever reaction it might bring. He understood the newsroom and appreciated the dedication and the care that had gone into the work.” Winfield was by Boccardi's side when he testified to Congress about the performance of news outlets in covering the disputed 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. After he retired from the firm, Winfield became a founding director of the International Senior Lawyers Project, a non-governmental organization that mobilizes pro bono legal support to advance the rule of law and accountable, inclusive economic development around the world. Winfield’s volunteer activities to promote freedom of expression took him to over 20 countries. He led media reform programs in several former Soviet bloc nations, trained lawyers and judges from Albania to Zimbabwe about freedom of expression and served as a court observer in overseas media defamation cases. “Dick Winfield was a true pillar of the First Amendment, and the impact of his work protecting journalists has been felt around the world,” said Karen Kaiser, senior vice president and general counsel at AP. “He was a trailblazer for the AP, setting the foundations for the legal protection for journalism across the country. And above all, he was a kind a gracious person and a great mentor to younger generations.” Winfield also taught media law classes at the Columbia and Fordham law schools, both in New York City. Born in Chicago on Jan. 20, 1933, Winfield grew up in Valley Stream, Long Island, the eldest son of Richard Paul Winfield and Mary Bertrand Monaghan Winfield.                       ",

Troy, Michigan-based Altair is working with investment bankers to gauge interest from potential suitors, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential. If the talks are successful, a deal could be signed in coming weeks, one of the sources said, cautioning that a transaction is not guaranteed and Altair may choose to stay independent. Altair's shares jumped more than 14% on Tuesday after Reuters reported on the company's sale talks. Potential bidders include rival design software makers such as PTC and Cadence Design Systems, the sources said. Reuters could not determine whether PTC and Cadence have approached Altair. Altair, PTC, and Cadence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Engineering software companies have become attractive acquisition targets as investors bet on companies that could benefit from the boom in artificial intelligence. In January, design software Synopsys agreed to buy smaller rival Ansys in a deal worth about $35 billion. Earlier this year, Bentley Systems, which competes with Altair, held talks with Schneider Electric but a deal did not materialize. Founded in 1985, Altair makes a range of software solutions, including what is referred to as computer-aided engineering software that helps engineers design, analyze and manufacture products. Altair's stock has jumped about 55% over the past year and the company trades at a higher multiple compared to its peers. Altair trades at roughly 46 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), compared to roughly 30 times for Bentley Systems, according to LSEG data. In its most recent quarterly earnings, Altair posted an 8% rise in software revenue to $135.4 million, at the higher end of its guidance. Altair works with several large corporations including Ford Motor and International Paper, according to its website. (Reporting by Anirban Sen and Milana Vinn in New YorkEditing by Nick Zieminski) ",

TreeHouse Foods Inc., of Oak Brook, Illinois, said the updated recall includes all products made at a factory in Ontario, Canada, and sold at stores including Albertson's, Aldi, Dollar General, Kroger, Publix, Target, Walmart and others. The recall includes frozen toaster waffles, Belgian waffles and pancakes, the company said. No illnesses linked to the recall have been confirmed. The company is working with the U.S. and Canadian food safety regulators to resolve the problem. The recalled waffles are sold under a variety of names including Walmart’s Great Value and Target’s Good & Gather. A complete list of the affected products can be found on the TreeHouse website. Consumers should throw away the products or return them to stores for a refund. TreeHouse officials issued a limited recall on Oct. 18 after routine testing found listeria at the Brantford, Ontario, factory. Additional testing indicated that more manufacturing lines at the plant could be contaminated with the bacteria, the company said. Production was halted and the company said it intends to restart production after taking steps that include “deep cleaning, sanitation, hygienic restoration\" and other procedures. The company operates 26 sites in the U.S. and Canada that make private brand foods and beverages, according to its website. No other plants were affected, officials said. Listeria infections can cause mild illness including fever and diarrhea or more serious problems. The illness is most dangerous to pregnant women, newborns, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Symptoms can take up to 10 weeks to appear. The CDC estimates that 1,600 people are infected with listeria each year in the United States and 260 die. This is the third large U.S. recall in recent months of foods potentially contaminated with listeria, a hardy bacteria that can be difficult to eradicate. In July, Boar's Head Provision Co. Inc. of Sarasota, Florida, recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli meat and shut down its plant in Jarratt, Virginia, after deli meat contaminated with listeria led to at least 10 deaths and nearly 50 hospitalizations. This month Oregon-based BrucePac recalled nearly 12 million pounds of meat and poultry processed at an Oklahoma plant after routine testing detected listeria.   ",

In the US, regulators have dramatically watered down plans to impose higher capital requirements on banks after the proposals sparked outrage. In the European Union, the bloc’s three biggest economies have called on leaders to pause reforms and revisit some measures that could hurt competitiveness. “It seems that, 16 years after Lehman, implementation fatigue has started to set in,” Knot told an audience at an event at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York, without calling out any particular jurisdiction’s behavior. Knot warned that financial stability could be “taken for granted” in times of calm and left to technicians to handle because “there are so many other policy priorities for governments.” “That would be a mistake,” he said, adding that financial stability is the foundation for almost all public policy. “If financial stability is gone, as a government you can forget about the other policy priorities. You will spend most of your time drawing up rescue plans for an economy in free fall.” Plans agreed but not yet implemented include the final package of post-crisis banking reforms which curb institutions’ discretion to assess how much capital they need for certain activities. There are also new packages on things like the funds industry. Knot said the agreed measures are “needed to address existing vulnerabilities — vulnerabilities that could lead to the next crisis, if they are allowed to persist.” The Dutch central banker and other regulators have spoken frequently about new risks that have emerged since the financial crisis, including the non-bank financial sector which now holds around half the global system’s assets. “The financial system is always evolving, so our policy also needs to evolve,” he said.

        "body": "By Dietrich Knauth NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bankrupt Tupperware Brands agreed on Tuesday to sell its business to a group of lenders for $23.5 million in cash and over $63 million in debt relief, canceling its plans for an open-market auction of its assets. The food storage and kitchen products company announced the deal at a bankruptcy court hearing in Wilmington, Delaware. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon said he would quickly schedule a separate court hearing to consider approval of the sale, which was likely the best result given the company's \"difficult and challenging circumstances.\" The Orlando, Florida-based company filed for bankruptcy protection last month, with $818 million in debt and a plan to find a buyer within 30 days. But a faction of Tupperware's lenders opposed the company's sale plans, seeking instead to claim the assets for themselves. The new sale agreement will allow the lenders to purchase Tupperware's brand name and operations in multiple key markets, Tupperware attorney Spencer Winters said at the court hearing. During a court hearing last week, Tupperware argued that the lenders, which bought Tupperware's debt at a steep discount, should not be allowed to squeeze out Tupperware's other creditors and prevent them from benefiting from a sale. The lenders had argued that Tupperware's proposed auction would unfairly prevent them from using a debt exchange as part of their bid for Tupperware's assets. The new deal strikes a middle ground, giving the lenders the ability to use debt cancellation for part of the purchase price, while also requiring them to put up some cash that Tupperware can use to pay other debts. The lenders now poised to acquire Tupperware include Alden Global Capital, Stonehill Institutional Partners and a trading desk of Bank of America. Tupperware's popularity exploded in the 1950s as women of the post-war generation held \"Tupperware parties\" at their homes to sell the containers as they sought empowerment and independence. But the company said it relied too much on independent sales representatives in recent years, suffering a years-long slump in sales while missing out on opportunities to sell products online or in retail stores.

Tesla shares are down approximately 9% since Tesla revealed its robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, at its showy “We, Robot” event from the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, Calif., on Oct. 10. For the third quarter, Tesla is expected to report revenue of $25.42 billion, per Bloomberg consensus, higher than the $25.05 billion it reported in Q2 and also topping the $23.40 billion Tesla reported a year ago. The Street expects Tesla to post adjusted EPS of $0.51, on adjusted net income of $2.06 billion, and operating profit of $1.96 billion, per Bloomberg. Earlier this month, Tesla (TSLA) announced third quarter deliveries that slightly missed expectations, sending the stock lower. Tesla said it delivered 462,890 vehicles in Q3, up 6.4% quarter over quarter, to mark the first quarter of delivery growth this year. The numbers also came in ahead of the 435,059 EVs the company delivered in the year-ago period. But Wall Street had expected Tesla to deliver closer to 463,897, according to Bloomberg. The debut and release of a cheaper EV is what many analysts and industry watchers believe will spur the next leg higher of EV sales, as even CEO Elon Musk has said before. During its Q2 report, Tesla and Musk said the company remains on track for the production of new vehicles, likely including a cheaper EV, in the first half of next year. Investors and analysts were left wanting more details from Tesla’s “We, Robot” event on the Cybercab itself and detailed testing plans, along with questions about the development of Tesla’s sub-$30,000 EV, dubbed the Model 2. “Overall, we found Tesla’s Robotaxi event to be underwhelming and stunningly absent on detail,” wrote Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi the day after the event. “While Musk articulated his vision for an autonomous world, it offered little beyond what he has articulated repeatedly over the last few years.“ Sacconaghi complained that details on new product offerings like the Cybercab and Robovan autonomous van and timeframes were missing. The analyst also felt Tesla would have a hard time leapfrogging other robotaxi competitors — such as Waymo and Cruise — for regulatory and technical reasons. In addition, the lack of any details or even a rendering of the Model 2 was also a disappointment. Tesla may show a rendering of that cheaper EV in its third quarter shareholder deck in lieu of actually demonstrating it to investors and the public at an event (or tease another launch event in the near future).

That gap creates the risk of another potential round of volatility on global markets similar to the rattling August selloff. “We worry there is a tension between the kind of optimism in markets and the level of valuations in markets” and “the geopolitical backdrop” within and across countries “that could give rise to further shocks,” Tobias Adrian, director of the fund’s monetary and capital markets department, said in an interview. The Nov. 5 vote in the US represents a wildcard for markets and for economic watchdogs like the IMF, given the size of the economy and the direct impact US policies could have on global finance and trade. Adrian pointed to tariff and industrial policies, as well as potential retaliation, as among the risks. Trump has threatened sweeping new tariffs on imports from China, and across-the-board charges on other trade partners too. The IMF warnings over market risk from geopolitical shocks are a contrast with its view of the broader economic picture, which looks more sanguine. The fund slightly lowered its global growth forecast for next year in a separate report Tuesday and warned that downside risks are building, but it still sees the world economy on track for a so-called soft landing. The financial stability report flagged risks including rising debt levels, as well as world politics. “Accommodative financial conditions that keep near-term risks at bay also facilitate the buildup of vulnerabilities — such as lofty asset valuations, the global rise in private and government debt, and increased use of leverage by non-bank financial institutions — which raises risks to financial stability in the future,” the IMF study said. It pointed to the August episode, when expected divergence between US and Japanese monetary policy triggered an unwinding of the yen carry trade, which sent Japanese stocks tumbling and reverberated through global markets.

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A film production company that helped make “Blade Runner 2049” has sued Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk for using an AI-generated image resembling a scene from the science fiction movie to market Tesla's new robotaxis. Alcon Entertainment said it refused all permissions but Tesla allegedly used artificial intelligence to “do it all anyway” when the carmaker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Oct. 10 during a live-streamed event at a Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, California. After pulling up to the stage in one of the company’s “Cybercabs,” Musk gave a speech that included a brief reference to the movie franchise. As he spoke, a screen showed an image of a man in a long coat looking over an orange-tinted ruined city. Alcon claims it resembles a key scene in which star Ryan Gosling arrives by “quasi-sentient flying car” to an abandoned Las Vegas. “I love Blade Runner, but I don’t know if we want that future,\" Musk said. \"I think we want that duster he’s wearing, but not the bleak apocalypse.” A copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Alcon this week in a Southern California federal court alleges that defendants had asked permission to use images from the movie “mere hours” before the event but Alcon “refused all permissions and adamantly objected.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Alcon is also suing Warner Bros, the movie's distributor that hosted Musk's robotaxi event. Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Alcon, which is working on a spinoff “Blade Runner 2099” series for Amazon, said it is in talks with automakers about brand collaborations but has avoided affiliating with Tesla because of Musk's “extreme political and social views” and his “massively amplified, highly politicized, capricious and arbitrary behavior, which sometimes veers into hate speech.” ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s biggest single owner of listed companies, added 4.5% on stocks in the period and 4.2% on fixed-income investments, according to a statement Tuesday. The fund’s total return was 0.1 percentage points lower than that of the benchmark against which it measures itself, reflecting underperformance by both internal and external equity managers during the quarter, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Trond Grande said in an interview. US equities advanced in the third quarter supported by improved economic data, including softer inflation figures. Widespread anticipation that the Federal Reserve would start easing monetary policy also spurred a shift out of big-tech stocks and into those likely to benefit from lower interest rates and a growing economy. While investors will be closely following the outcome of the US election, “we don’t see that as a major kind of event for markets either way,” Grande said. “We have to be mindful, at least for us as investors, that we now have a fund that is up 13.4% year to date. Our equities are up almost 18%. So it’s a really, really good year. I don’t think we should necessarily hope for that much for the rest of the year.” The underperfomance of the equity managers relative to the benchmark in the three months through August is a change compared to the first two quarters, Grande said. Year-to-date external managers are ahead of the benchmark, while their counterparts internally are at break-even, he said. “Whenever you have draw-downs you want to reassess and look at your process,” the executive said. “It was kind of broad based and that makes you think that it’s something systematic. But we haven’t really uncovered that in our analysis. It seems to be more idiosyncratic.” For the second quarter in a row, real estate weighed on returns. The fund gained 0.8% on its unlisted real estate holdings and 10.8% on unlisted renewable-energy infrastructure. Created in the 1990s to invest Norway’s oil and gas revenues abroad, the fund is largely an index tracker. It invests according to a strict mandate from the Finance Ministry, measuring itself against a bespoke benchmark index based on the FTSE Global All Cap Index for equities and Bloomberg Barclays indexes for fixed income. The bulk of NBIM’s capital is in publicly listed equities.          ",

Host of The Wolf of All Streets, Scott Melker, sat down with George Tung, host of CryptosRus, to discuss the significance of these inflows and whether external factors like the U.S. presidential elections are influencing market behavior. George Tung emphasized that institutional interest in bitcoin and ethereum remains strong, with inflows accelerating as the market improves. \"Last week was definitely a very good week. We saw IBIT alone take in over a billion dollars,\" Tung noted, highlighting the substantial inflows that occurred in a single week. The week marked the strongest for crypto investment products since back in July. When Melker brought up the possibility that U.S. elections, particularly Trump's increasing chances in predictive markets, might be driving some of this interest, Tung was uncertain. \"I don’t know which candidate actually will do better for the market,\" Tung stated, though he mentioned a fascinating statistic from prior election cycles where bitcoin saw significant gains leading up to the election. Wrapping up the discussion, Melker agreed that everyone is hoping for a favorable market outcome. \"If bitcoin's flying like that, I would imagine other markets will generally be up as well,\" Melker concluded, as both hosts anticipated how the crypto market will evolve in the months ahead. The momentum from last week seemed to continue Monday, with bitcoin ETFs attracting nearly another $300 million, according to Farside investors. ",

Long positions on futures linked to the benchmark index are at the highest since mid-2023 and are looking “particularly extended,” the team led by Chris Montagu wrote in a note. “We’re not suggesting investors should start to reduce exposure, but the positioning risks do rise when markets get extended like this,” they said. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. The Russell 2000 of smaller firms slipped 0.3%.

The agreement could be signed this week, nearly nine years after the 2015 disaster in the city of Mariana in southeastern Brazil that killed 19 people, left hundreds homeless, flooded forests and polluted the length of the Doce River. Under the deal, the mining companies will pay 100 billion reais over 20 years to enable authorities to carry out a series of projects and measures to repair and compensate for the disaster. The companies also will still have 32 billion reais in obligations to fulfill, including individual compensation to people affected by the disaster and environment recovery initiatives. The total 170 billion reais in compensation includes 38 billion already paid by the mining companies since the dam collapse. The agreement does not eliminate the possibility of new lawsuits related to damages that are still unknown today, should their connection with the dam rupture be proven at some point in the future, one of the sources said on condition of anonymity. Still, the deal is expected to eliminate more than a hundred public civil actions against the miners in Brazil, and the companies expect that individual requests related to the Mariana disaster will be met in full by 2025, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. The mining companies also hope that the class action lawsuits filed in London and the Netherlands will dry up following the final deal, the sources told Reuters. \"The main argument that the English used in their action when they started suing BHP is that in Brazil there is no resolution for this type of problem and that is why they needed to do it in England. This agreement proves exactly the opposite and therefore significantly weakens England's case,\" one of the sources told Reuters. Another source said that, either way, the cases abroad put pressure on the companies in Brazil, which ended up accepting a much higher amount in the final deal than they were initially willing to pay. ENGLISH CASE Law firm Pogust Goodhead is leading one of the biggest court cases in British legal history in London to determine whether BHP is liable. The case entered a decisive stage on Monday with the start of a 12-week trial.        ",

        "body": "By Michael Erman and Svea Herbst-Bayliss NEW YORK (Reuters) -Activist hedge fund Starboard Value's chief executive officer said on Tuesday that drugmaker Pfizer's board needs to hold management accountable for its underperformance, particularly for its record for producing profitable new drugs. \"We measure success in producing blockbuster drugs and we all get measured by our track records. The track record here is not great,\" said Jeffrey Smith, speaking at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York. Smith is also Starboard's chief investment officer. Starboard has built a $1 billion position in Pfizer, but had not previously detailed its concerns about the drugmaker. Smith met with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla last week, some days after the hedge fund's campaign at the company became public. Investors have fled Pfizer as pandemic worries declined and billions of dollars in COVID-19 vaccine and treatment sales disappeared. Pfizer shares were down 0.5% at $28.80 in late morning trading on Tuesday. The company's stock is trading at about half its pandemic-era high. A Pfizer spokesperson declined to comment on Smith's presentation. Smith argued that Pfizer has lost value because of poor capital allocation, research and development failures and problems with forecasting and budgeting. Beyond the loss of COVID-19 revenue, Pfizer has also had to contend in recent quarters with disappointing data for a closely watched experimental obesity drug, the weak launch of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, and pulling its sickle cell disease treatment Oxbryta due to deaths in its clinical trials. Smith did not make any specific prescriptions for Pfizer or its management at the presentation. In an interview on CNBC, he said a change at the top of the company could make sense, but stopped short of calling for Bourla to step down. \"Something material needs to change. They can't just close their eyes and assume it's going to get better,\" he said. Starboard's campaign got off to an unusual start. Two former Pfizer executives had indicated they were working with Starboard to press for changes at Pfizer but then reversed course and said they supported the company's current CEO, Bourla.

The process is at an early stage, and it’s possible that the talks may not result in a deal, the people said. Dye & Durham, which provides software and services to the legal and banking sectors, went on an acquisition spree after an initial public offering in 2020. But it has been forced to reconsider its growth strategy because of concerns about high leverage. The company had long-term debt of more than C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) as of June 30. Representatives for Dye & Durham declined to comment. The shares, which briefly traded above C$50 in 2021, closed Monday at C$16.90, giving the company a market value of C$1.13 billion. Revenue in the fiscal year ended June 30 totaled C$457.7 million. Last year, the firm hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. to advise it on a potential sale of noncore assets, including its financial services division. Earlier this month, the company agreed to give a board seat to Blacksheep Fund Management Ltd., one of its largest shareholders, as it tries to fend off a campaign by activist investors. Engine Capital LP, which says it owns about 7.1% of Dye & Durham’s shares, said last week it’s still planning to pursue boardroom changes and will introduce its own slate of director candidates for the annual meeting.

        "body": "By Sinead Cruise and Lawrence White LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC's history-making new chief financial officer Pam Kaur is a battle-hardened risk and audit veteran who credits her success to the \"Power of Chi\". The first woman to occupy the role in the bank's 160-year history, she has observed at close quarters the challenges HSBC faces under new CEO Georges Elhedery, as it navigates a new interest rate cycle and a more fractious relationship between China and the West. Indian-born Kaur, 60, joined HSBC from Deutsche Bank in April 2013, rising to the role of group chief risk and compliance officer before landing her latest promotion in a sweeping revamp announced on Tuesday. Prior to HSBC, Kaur held senior risk and audit positions at Citi and Lloyds Banking Group before a crisis-era stint at bailed-out UK lender Royal Bank of Scotland. Posts on professional networking platform LinkedIn offer a glimpse into Kaur's likely management style, with courage and confidence described as staples of successful leadership under a \"Power of Chi\" management framework she has promoted to more than 10,000 followers. She will need all the chi, or positive energy, she can muster as global lenders like HSBC struggle to insulate strategies from geopolitics, contain the spiralling costs of doing business while also tapping into new sources of revenue. \"I'm not sure you could actually find a greater collection of banks that have been through the fiery furnaces of issues, and she's been in finance, in audit or in risk in all of them,\" said one former co-worker, commenting on Kaur's rich experience. \"You never want anyone in a senior position seeing bad stuff for the first time. You need someone who's actually been around, who has faced live bullets before they go into battle,\" the person said. Kaur is expected to maintain a relatively low public profile as CFO, affording the newly-installed CEO Elhdedery space to focus on client-facing activities including winning greater business from HSBC's corporate customers, sources said. However, the London-based executive, who holds an MBA from India's Panjab University will be no pushover when it comes to devising strategy, the sources said, and will bring her extensive experience to bear on HSBC's future direction. Elhedery said Tuesday's reorganisation would help unleash the lender's full potential, although analysts said it lacked detail about savings and stoked debate about the changes he and Kaur might pursue next.

        "body": "(Reuters) - The global transition toward electric vehicles will have \"far-reaching\" impacts on investment, production, international trade and employment, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday as part of its update to global economic growth forecasts. The analysis was included in the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook, which was released as policymakers meet at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings this week to discuss efforts to boost global growth, deal with debt distress and finance the green energy transition. \"The rising adoption of electric vehicles represents a fundamental transformation of the global automotive industry. It will have far-reaching consequences,\" the IMF said. The move toward EVs has accelerated in recent years and is seen as a key way to help countries achieve climate goals. In 2022, transportation accounted for 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., 21% in the European Union, and 8% in China, the IMF said. Rising adoption of EVs has been supported by the EU's goal of reducing emissions from cars by 50% for the 2030-2035 period from 2021 levels, while the U.S. government has provided subsidies for EVs and charging stations. The IMF noted that the global automotive industry stands out for having high wages, strong profits, large export markets and using a high degree of technology. The acceleration toward EVs would remake that landscape, particularly if China maintains its current edge in production and exports against U.S. and European rivals. Under realistic EV market penetration scenarios, Europe's GDP would be reduced by about 0.3% in the medium term, the IMF said. \"In these scenarios, employment declines in the automotive sector, and labor reallocates gradually to less capital-intensive sectors (with lower value added per worker),\" the IMF said. Both the U.S. and EU have imposed tariffs on Chinese-made EVs to counter what they say are unfair subsidies from Beijing to Chinese manufacturers. Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration introduced a 100% duty on Chinese EVs, while earlier this month EU member states narrowly backed import duties on Chinese-made EVs of up to 45%. Chinese EV makers have so far priced their vehicles below their rivals, a crucial advantage given EVs currently remain more expensive than gasoline alternatives and demand has been weakening for EVs globally. The French government said earlier this month it would reduce its support for EV buyers, joining Germany, which ended its subsidy scheme late last year.

Moody’s “had a strong run into the quarter given issuance resilience,” wrote Jeffrey Silber, a BMO analyst. Borrowers across the globe seized on declining interest rates and strong investor demand to borrow over $600 billion last month, making it the busiest September in more than two decades. More companies are expected to raise funds after reporting third-quarter earnings to get ahead of any potentially volatility that may result from US elections in two weeks.

Global benchmark Brent climbed above $76 a barrel. The conflict in the Middle East has continued even as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday in another attempt to engineer a cease-fire — possibly the Biden administration’s last chance to secure a deal before the US presidential election. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said an Israeli strike near one of the capital’s main government-run health facilities killed 13 people, including a child, and wounded 57 others. “We’re seeing a constant push-pull between expectations of a cease-fire — which would unwind the geopolitical risk premium — and concerns over potential escalation,” said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Group. “This environment remains highly volatile, with traders operating under low risk thresholds, contributing to significant price swings.” Crude has been buffeted this month — with Brent fluctuating in a range of more than $11 — as the war in the Middle East raises the potential for disruptions to supplies. At the same time, top importer China has moved to support growth with stimulus, but investors remain wary that the global oil market may swing to a surplus in the coming quarters. “Assuming no supply disruptions in the Middle East, the oil balance looks increasingly comfortable through 2025,” ING analysts Ewa Manthey and Warren Patterson wrote in a note. “With the market returning to a sizable surplus, we should at least see the front end of the curve moving into contango,” they said, referring to the market structure which indicates oversupply.

        "body": "Walmart (WMT) announced Tuesday it will offer same-day prescription delivery services in six states, with a plan to roll out to all 49 states in which it operates a pharmacy in by January. The first six states are Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. North Dakota is the only state where Walmart doesn't operate a pharmacy. The move brings Walmart into the competitive field of online pharmacies and same-day retail deliveries, with players like Amazon (AMZN) Pharmacy, Walgreens (WBA), and CVS (CVS). The new service is being integrated into the existing Walmart delivery service, where patients can add their prescription to their cart along with other items — a key differentiator, according to Walmart — and schedule a delivery time. It will apply any new or existing prescriptions and insurance coverage as if the patient were coming to the store to pick it up, Walmart said in its announcement. But there are a few restrictions. Controlled substances, those that need refrigeration, and Medicare Part B items will not be eligible for delivery. Competitors offer delivery in as little as two hours in some markets. Walgreens, for example, offers same-day delivery in a majority of its 8,700 stores and delivery within two hours in about 800 stores. It also has restrictions for controlled substances, temperature-controlled medicines, and other insurance-based or state regulation-based restrictions. To that end, Walmart is working on ramping up its service to include on-demand delivery \"within hours\" and an express service delivering in as soon as 30 minutes. The current iteration will be free to Walmart+ members, and the standard $9.95 delivery charge will apply to others. It is unclear if there will be additional fees for the faster delivery options. \"By combining Pharmacy Delivery into a single order, we're strengthening our commitment to providing everything they need, whenever and wherever (customers) need it,\" Tom Ward, executive vice president and chief eCommerce officer, said in a statement. Walmart said it launched the new service after a recent survey showed that 55% of customers \"expressed a desire to have their prescriptions delivered along with their groceries and other items they need in a single online order.\" Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

Still, Governor Andrew Bailey said regulators have already realized there’s a need for further tools to monitor these players. “It is more in the way of a flow test – simulate shocks, let them flow through the system and see what happens,” Bailey said in prepared remarks at Bloomberg’s Global Regulatory Forum in New York. “We need to develop more of these tools of surveillance of risks.” The system-wide exploratory scenario was designed to improve the central bank’s understanding of how banks and non-banks behave in stressed conditions. At the heart of regulators’ concern is a shift in risk-taking from banks to non-banks since the global financial crisis. Bailey said the central bank will reveal the results of the latest exercise by the end of the year. “It’s an opaque and highly disparate world,” Bailey said. “The banking world challenges us but it is actually much more homogeneous, so we have to have these tools that say how do these rather disparate and opaque pieces fit together.” As parts of its efforts to tame risks in the non-bank financial sector — a group that now accounts for roughly half the world’s financial assets — the Bank of England has already announced plans for a liquidity facility that non-banks can access. Bailey called on other central banks around the world to follow suit. “To avoid a systemic crisis, and reflecting the growth of the non-bank sector, central banks should consider permanent emergency facilities for non-banks,” Bailey said. The test scenario incorporated many elements from recent market events, including the shock tied to liability-driven investments in 2022. When gilt prices collapsed in the wake of then-Prime Minister Liz Truss’s historic tax-cutting plan, pension fund managers using LDIs faced margin calls. The central bank ultimately stepped in to stabilize the market.         ",

The company referred to this as a \"next-gen algorithm for AI self-teaching\" — one it believed that could, if all goes according to plan, automate large portions of the economy someday. It took a while, but that AI is starting to arrive. Anthropic on Tuesday released an upgraded version of its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model that can understand and interact with any desktop app. Via a new \"Computer Use\" API, now in open beta, the model can imitate keystrokes, button clicks, and mouse gestures, essentially emulating a person sitting at a PC. \"We trained Claude to see what’s happening on a screen and then use the software tools available to carry out tasks,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \"When a developer tasks Claude with using a piece of computer software and gives it the necessary access, Claude looks at screenshots of what’s visible to the user, then counts how many pixels vertically or horizontally it needs to move a cursor in order to click in the correct place.\" Developers can try out Computer Use via Anthropic's API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. The new 3.5 Sonnet without Computer Use is rolling out to Claude apps, and brings various performance improvements over the outgoing 3.5 Sonnet model. A tool that can automate tasks on a PC is hardly a novel idea. Countless companies offer such tools, from decades-old RPA vendors to newer upstarts like Relay, Induced AI, and Automat. In the race to develop so-called \"AI agents,\" the field has only become more crowded. AI agents remains an ill-defined term, but it generally refers to AI that can automate software. Some analysts say AI agents could provide companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars that they're pouring into AI. Companies seem to agree: According to a recent Capgemini survey, 10% of organizations already use AI agents and 82% will integrate them within the next three years. Salesforce made splashy announcements about its AI agent tech this summer, while Microsoft touted new tools for building AI agents yesterday. OpenAI, which is plotting its own brand of AI agents, sees the tech as a step toward super-intelligent AI. Anthropic calls its take on the AI agent concept an \"action-execution layer\" that lets the new 3.5 Sonnet perform desktop-level commands. Thanks to its ability to browse the web (not a first for AI models, but a first for Anthropic), 3.5 Sonnet can use any website and any application.                            ",

Investors and analysts expect a series of consecutive cuts until the deposit rate – currently at 3.25% — reaches 2% or even lower in mid-2025. Money markets firmed bets on a half-point interest-rate reduction in December, lifting the possibility to 28% from around 20% on Monday. Looking further ahead, views remain almost evenly split between five or six 25-basis-point cuts by the end of next year. In a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Centeno said that he sees “monetary policy as continuing this gradual, but steady, predictable path toward more neutral level for the interest rate.” He stressed that such a neutral rate might be “at 2% or slightly below 2%,” and that the current policy rate “is still way above this neutral level, so this process is to continue.” Speaking separately to Bloomberg Television’s Francine Lacqua, President Christine Lagarde dodged the topic of half-point moves saying she didn’t want to speculate. Centeno, one of the ECB’s most dovish officials, said that inflation will see an uptick in the next months, he expects it only slightly above the 2% target in coming quarters. “I see more risks in undershooting target inflation than the other way around,” he said. --With assistance from James Hirai, Bastian Benrath-Wright, Alexander Weber and Craig Stirling.

Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance In a white paper released Tuesday, Pramol Dhawan, the head of emerging markets, and Michael Story, executive vice president and emerging-markets fixed income strategist at the $2 trillion asset manager, said investors should avoid the “temptation” to migrate toward crowded positions in high-yielding countries. “That game may have worked two decades ago,” they wrote. “But it is a difficult game to win today.” Instead, money managers should prioritize bonds from lower-risk countries with reasonable valuations, and use emerging-market debt as a way to diversify from domestic credit risks, they said. Dhawan’s $4.5 billion Emerging Markets Bond Fund has delivered 23% returns in the past year, beating more than 90% of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “The case for EM debt should not be anchored on spreads, yields, or some other valuation metric. It should be based primarily on diversification benefits,” they wrote. “Many investors today use EM debt for the wrong reasons, manage it imprudently, or overlook the best parts.” Debt from developing nations has seen a third year of outflows due to tight global financing conditions and geopolitical conflicts. This year, debt from high yielders has handed investors a 12.5% return — led by countries like Argentina and Bolivia — compared to returns of 3.5% for high-grade EM credits, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index. Once-booming economic growth in emerging markets has slowed, leading Dhawan and Story to focus more on global factors when evaluating the assets class. Some investors have already turned cautious ahead of the US vote, with JPMorgan’s global head of research Joyce Chang recommending a neutral approach to emerging markets on election risks. On the political front, Dhawan and Story said a bottom-up strategy is needed to evaluate risks in the developing world. They’re steering clear of the type of top-down analysis that focuses on harnessing excess yield, which has predominated the approach many took starting two decades ago. “Investors who were leaning into risk and trying to time the market around macro events started to play a loser’s game,” they wrote. “EM often rewards investors who minimize losses rather than maximize gains, and who avoid concentrated positions in high-yielding countries.”        ",

GM CFO Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday the company is eyeing $2 billion to $4 billion of additional improvements in its EV profitability in 2025. This comes as the company is finally gaining traction in its electric vehicle business after years of investment, due to some cost rationalization and assistance from government tax credits. The company said it delivered 32,000 EVs in the third quarter. Popular sellers included the new Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EV crossovers. For 2024, GM said it will produce and wholesale 200,000 EVs. Jacobson reaffirmed a target of hitting \"positive variable profits\" for the EV division this year. Next year, GM will roll out new EVs such as the Cadillac Optiq and the redesigned Bolt. The auto giant once again surprised the Street with its performance and outlook. GM reported third quarter sales rose 10.5% year over year to $48.8 billion, besting analyst estimates for $44.6 billion. The company called out success with pickup trucks such as the Silverado and Sierra, and crossovers like the Trax. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.96 improved 29.8% versus a year ago, well ahead of consensus forecasts for $2.43. Earnings were in part fueled by GM's ongoing aggressive share repurchase activity — in the quarter it reduced its share count by 19% from the prior year. Jacobson said GM will continue to execute share repurchases in 2025 to win over skeptics on the stock. GM stock was up 2% in early trading. The company hiked its annual profit forecast. GM sees full-year adjusted earnings of $10 to $10.50 a share. Previously, it had modeled $9.50 to $10.50 a share. \"We believe this was a large step in the right direction as management continues to navigate the choppy waters and ultimately, was a long-awaited turnaround for the GM story proving testament to GM’s performance following its goals to balance production and profitability,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a client note.

The United Auto Workers has threatened strikes over Stellantis delays in the planned Belvidere investment, which has prompted Stellantis to file suits to prevent work stoppages. Asked about the delay, Granholm said \"there's a whole array of considerations with respect to that and we are in conversation about it.\" Earlier this month, UAW President Shawn Fain said hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs were at stake if Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the Nov. 5 election and made good on his threat to repeal investments in electric vehicles. Trump says EV production threatens U.S. jobs. Democrats have seized on Trump's running mate, U.S. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, declining to commit to maintaining the $500 million GM grant. A GM spokesperson said it is \"still in the negotiation phase of the grant\" and declined to forecast what might happen if the grant was not approved. Stellantis did not immediately comment. GM shares were up 9.7% Tuesday afternoon, while Stellantis shares were up 0.5%. Granholm at the conference said President Joe Biden's industrial strategy to ensure next-generation vehicle production was stronger than prior efforts. \"This time, the United States government is not effing around,\" she said. The Biden administration is helping automakers \"cut costs and secure supply chains and innovate new technologies and help you be globally competitive,\" Granholm said. \"We are not just bringing a knife to a gunfight. We are bringing an armada now.\" Granholm said government has a key role.   ",

Legion's involvement comes several months after Anson Funds Management built its stake and began urging the company to consider a sale, Reuters reported in July. In addition to pushing for one board seat, Legion wants the company to cut costs, the sources said. The firm is run by Christopher Kiper. A representative for Five9 declined to comment. Reuters could not determine the size of the stake. The activists got involved after Zoom Video Communications -- whose $15 billion deal to buy Five9 was rejected by shareholders in 2021 -- made another bid last December. The two did not reach a deal.

People often plan non-emergency surgeries in the fall and early-winter months when their insurance coverage will pick up more of the bill, but they may have to wait while health systems preserve supplies for emergencies. “It’s not great for patients, but it’s kind of doing the most good with what you have,” said Erin Fox, associate chief pharmacy officer at University of Utah Health. The federal government and medical suppliers have taken several steps to help ease the supply crunch created by Hurricane Helene, which forced Baxter International (BAX) to close its North Carolina plant late last month. But experts say supplies are still choppy, and improvements will take time. Here’s a closer look the situation. Baxter’s North Cove, North Carolina, location makes about 60% of the intravenous solutions used in the U.S. every day, according to the American Hospital Association. It also makes fluids used by patients on home dialysis and sterile water used to clean patient surgery sites during operations. But flooding triggered by the storm washed out bridges nearby and water came into the factory, forcing the shutdown. Baxter says the site sustained no structural damage. Health systems started conserving fluids shortly after the plant shut down. Some switched patients who can drink fluids to Gatorade or water instead of giving them an IV. Hospitals also have started postponing planned procedures that can wait, like some orthopedic surgeries or heart procedures, said Dr. Chris DeRienzo, chief physician executive for the American Hospital Association. Baxter has limited the fluids supplies it sends to distributors and health systems. The impact on a patient will depend partly on how heavily a hospital or health system relies on Baxter, said Nancy Foster, a vice president with the hospital association. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved temporarily importing fluids from Baxter plants in several countries. The company also has already started easing some of the limits it had placed on supplies. Baxter rival B. Braun Medical has increased production at its Daytona Beach, Florida, site, which escaped damage from another hurricane, and at a location in California. The FDA also issued new temporary guidelines designed to make it easier for compounding pharmacies to produce certain IV drugs that are in short supply.            ",

        "body": "By Kenrick Cai and Jeffrey Dastin SAN FRANCISCO - Anthropic, a startup backed by Alphabet and Amazon.com, released a pair of updated artificial intelligence models on Tuesday, along with a new capability to autonomously perform computer tasks and save users keystrokes. The new \"computer use\" feature can tell AI \"where to move the mouse, where to click, what to type, in order to do quite complicated tasks,\" Anthropic's Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan said in an interview. The capability is tailored to software developers and represents a move toward AI agents, programs that require little human intervention to carry out multi-step actions. Researchers have touted agents as a frontier for AI development beyond chatbots, which easily conjure prose or computer code though not actions. Anthropic demonstrated a use case for the feature that entailed coding a basic website, and another that used various programs including Google Search and Apple Maps to plan a sunrise outing. Anthropic offers software developers three versions of Claude, its family of AI models, at price points that vary based on their performance. This week's updates come to Sonnet, the mid-tier model, and Haiku, the cheapest. The new 3.5 Haiku can generate computer code in a manner \"almost comparable\" to the version of Sonnet released in June, according to Kaplan. CEO Dario Amodei told Reuters at the time that the company intended to update Opus, the most capable model, by the end of the year. The computer use feature is currently limited to the new version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and comes with safeguards to prevent its application toward spam, fraud and election-related misuse, Anthropic said. Kaplan said the AI still makes mistakes. Mike Krieger, a co-founder of Instagram who joined Anthropic this spring as chief product officer, said the company wants feedback from business customers to learn where to focus development of the feature. Meanwhile, a labs team inside Anthropic is exploring how to make the capability available for consumers, something Krieger said he personally wants. \"I was booking flights,\" he said. \"I really just want this to be completely automated.\" Microsoft on Monday unveiled an application for its clients to build their own agents that can handle queries, identify sales leads and manage inventory.

Shares of the company rose 3.6% in early trading. Improving intermodal volumes, higher-than-inflation pricing and a better operating ratio have helped the railroad shield profitability even as the freight industry continues to go through a downturn. Atalanta, Georgia-based Norfolk Southern reported an adjusted operating ratio of 63.4%, representing a 570 basis point improvement from a year ago. The ratio is a keenly watched metric that indicates operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. A higher operating ratio reflects an increase in costs. Severe weather events in the quarter posed service challenges at railroads to which the company has responded positively, displaying operating ratio improvement and positioning itself better to capture volumes off highway. \"Our team drove productivity and grew volumes while demonstrating resiliency in dealing with weather challenges,\" CEO Mark George, who took over the top job in September, said in a statement. \"We delivered sequential and year-over-year margin improvement putting us on track to achieve our adjusted operating ratio targets for the second half and full year 2024,\" he added. The company reported operating revenue of $3.1 billion for the third quarter, rising 3% from the previous year, beating analysts' estimates of $3.08 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. During the quarter, the company closed two railway line sales, resulting in cash proceeds of nearly $400 million and gains of $380 million, it said. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a profit of $3.25 per share, above analysts' estimates of $3.11. (Reporting by Abhinav Parmar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel) ",

That includes businesses that produce the wafers that are ultimately turned into semiconductors, as well as manufacturers of chips and chipmaking equipment. The credits also will apply to solar wafers — an unexpected shift that could help spur domestic production of panel components. So far, the US has struggled to foster manufacturing of those parts, despite a surge of investment in US panel-making factories. But the benefits don’t extend all the way up the supply chain. Still excluded are facilities that produce underlying materials like polysilicon, which is used to make wafers. That approach is consistent with how the original law was written, as well as how the Commerce Department defines semiconductors and equipment as opposed to materials, a Treasury official said. The tax refunds are one of three main subsidy streams available from the Chips Act, which aims to revitalize the American semiconductor industry after decades of production shifting abroad. The law also set aside $39 billion in grant funding — more than 90% of which has been allocated, though not yet spent — and $75 billion in loans and loan guarantees, of which officials are likely to use less than half. The latter two incentive categories have garnered the most attention — President Joe Biden has even visited factories to herald the announcements — but it’s the tax credits that could be most meaningful for companies. Proposed grants typically cover 10% to 15% of project costs, compared with 25% for tax credits. The idea is to make it just as cost-effective to build a factory in the US as in Asia. “Our goal is to give you the minimum amount of money necessary to get you to expand on our shores in a way that advances our economic and national security objectives,” Mike Schmidt, director of the Commerce Department’s chips office, said in an August interview when asked about tax credits. “That means looking at all sources of funding and then figuring out how our funds get you over that hump.”                     ",

The so-called \"seed house\" used an Atenea-UBB printer and a KUKA KR120 industrial robot to rapidly create the compact home, pouring layer upon layer of concrete to build the walls in just 29 hours. It then took two days to piece together. \"Casa Semilla has seven walls made from printed concrete and covers an area of some 30 square meters,\" said Claudia Muñoz, an academic at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Biobío, which this month presented the finished home. \"We print these industrialized walls entirely in our lab.\" Rodrigo García, another member of the university's Manufacturing in Construction Group, said the technology could help change how construction was done, using flexible building models, even if there's plenty left to be proven about cost and reliability. \"This is a very revolutionary technology because it changes the traditional way of building, where plans are made, products are quoted, a large number of elements have to be purchased and the land prepared, which is time-consuming,\" he said. The house was put up in the Torreones neighborhood of Concepción on land belonging to a private construction company, which got involved with the project. The concept could, if successful, spur thinking about the construction sector. \"We have many housing demands in Latin America and we are used to importing things,\" added Garcia. \"This is a complex change to adopt, which has to be adapted to our Chilean reality rooted in earthquakes, to our variety of climate.\" (Reporting by Reuters TV and Fabian Cambero; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Hugh Lawson) ",

While the IMF significantly raised its 2024 growth forecast for Brazil to 3.0%, up from 2.1% in July, it noted in its updated World Economic Outlook that Mexico's economy is expected to expand 1.5%, seven-tenths of a percentage point less than previously estimated. The contrasting momentum of the two countries have led to different inflation scenarios, with Brazil, the region's largest economy, expected to keep tightening monetary policy to curb rising prices, while Mexico moves towards lowering rates. The IMF attributed Brazil's improved outlook to stronger private consumption and investment in the first half of the year, fueled by a tight labor market, government transfers, and a less-than-expected disruption from floods earlier this year. As for Mexico, the IMF said the revised figure reflects weakening domestic demand. Among the region's major economies, Argentina is the only one projected to contract this year, with a 3.5% decline, more than double its 1.6% drop in 2023. However, the IMF expects a strong rebound in 2025, with 5.0% growth. Overall, economic activity in Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to remain broadly stable this year compared to the 2.2% growth seen in 2023, with the IMF forecasting an acceleration to 2.5% in 2025.

It left the projection for this year unchanged at 3.2%. Inflation will slow to 4.3% next year from 5.8% in 2024. The fund has been cautioning for a couple of years that the world economy is likely to expand at its current mediocre level in the medium term — too little to give nations the resources they need to reduce poverty and confront climate change. “The risks are building up to the downside, and there is a growing uncertainty in the global economy,” Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said in a briefing. “There is geopolitical risk, with the potential for escalation of regional conflicts,” that could affect commodity markets, he said. “There is a rise of protectionism, protectionist policies, disruptions in trade that could also affect global activity.” While the outlook doesn’t explicitly mention the US election, the contest in two weeks looms over annual meetings that will see finance ministers and central bankers from almost 200 nations gather at the IMF and World Bank headquarters in Washington, just three blocks from the White House. A Bloomberg Economics analysis earlier this year found that Donald Trump’s vow to impose 60% tariffs on imports from China and 10% duties on those from the rest of the world would likely spur inflation and pressure the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. In a briefing on Tuesday, Gourinchas said that tariffs and trade uncertainty across countries risk reducing global economic output level by about 0.5% in 2026. The IMF last week flagged concern about global public debt, which is expected to reach $100 trillion, or 93% of world gross domestic product, by the end of this year. The surge is driven by the US and China. The fund is urging governments to make tough decisions to stabilize borrowing. With little political appetite to cut spending amid pressures to fund cleaner energy, support aging populations and bolster security, the “risks to the debt outlook are heavily tilted to the upside,” the IMF said.

The FAA called the rule \"the final piece in the puzzle for safely introducing these aircraft in the near term.\" Some flying companies hope to begin flying commercial passengers as soon as 2025. Low-altitude urban aircraft known as eVTOLs have drawn intense global interest, with numerous companies going public like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation. Joby shares rose 7% Tuesday, while Archer rose 3%. \"The opportunities for the use of powered lift operations are far-reaching, from transporting passengers in urban areas and short-haul operations such as air ambulance services and cargo operations to potentially serving smaller communities over time,\" the FAA said. Airlines and other companies are looking at developing transport services using battery-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically to ferry travelers to airports or for short city trips, allowing them to beat traffic. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said at a conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday the rule is designed to be flexible. The regulation has \"a performance-based approach, so you can look at fuel reserves and other things with this new technology, account for safety,\" he said. Former acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen, who is chief safety officer at Archer, said the announcement is a big milestone for the deployment of flying air taxis. \"Now we've got a roadmap,\" he told Reuters. Joby CEO JoeBen Bevirt said the rule \"will ensure the U.S. continues to play a global leadership role in the development and adoption of clean flight.\" The FAA said previously that air taxi operations will begin at a low rate, similar to helicopters, and using existing routes and infrastructure such as helipads and vertiports. The FAA said the rule allows pilots to train with a single set of flight controls while prior rules required two flight controls – for the student and instructor. Delta Air Lines invested $60 million in Joby in a partnership aiming to offer passengers air taxi transport to and from airports in New York and Los Angeles within a few years. Earlier this month, Toyota invested $500 million in Joby. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci) ",

In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF raised its 2024 and 2025 economic growth forecasts for the U.S. - the only developed economy to see its outlook marked up for both years - and its chief economist said the \"soft landing\" sought by the Federal Reserve in which inflation eases without big damage to the job market had largely been achieved. Emerging market powerhouses India and Brazil also stood out on the upside of the IMF forecasts, while it dialed back growth expectations for China for this year and left next year's forecast for the world's No. 2 economy at a below-trend 4.5%. Still, it warned that risks abound from armed conflicts, potential new trade wars and the hangover from the tight monetary policy employed by the Fed and other central banks to rein in inflation. \"Today, the IMF reported that the United States is leading the advanced economies on growth for the second year in a row,\" Lael Brainard, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, said in a statement. The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook said the shifts will leave 2024 global GDP growth unchanged from the 3.2% projected by the global lender in July, setting a lackluster tone for growth as world finance leaders gather in Washington this week for the IMF and World Bank annual meetings. Global growth is projected to be 3.2% in 2025, one-tenth of a percentage point lower than forecast in July, while medium-term growth is expected to fade to a \"mediocre\" 3.1% in five years, well below its pre-pandemic trend, the report showed. Nonetheless, the IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said some countries, including the U.S., were showing resilience. \"The news on the U.S. is very good in a sense,\" Gourinchas said at a press conference in Washington. \"The labor market picture remains one that is fairly robust, even though it has cooled off.\" \"I think the risks of a recession in the U.S. in the absence of a very sharp shock would be somewhat diminished,\" he said. Although Gourinchas said it looked as if the global inflation battle had largely been won, he told Reuters in an interview there is a risk that monetary policy could \"mechanically\" become too tight without interest rate cuts in some countries as inflation subsides, weighing on growth and jobs.

The company expects to use net proceeds from the transaction to pay down debt. The deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending April 30, would contribute a full-year earnings per share of about 10 cents to Smucker.

This comes at a time when the company is seeing signs of weakness in retail sales. Its online stores sales rose just 5% in the second quarter, slowing from a 7% increase in the first quarter.

Traders have flocked to the market amid a tight US presidential vote and persistent concern that violence in the Middle East may escalate into a wider war. Robust central-bank buying and expectations of US interest-rate cuts have also underpinned gold’s stellar run this year. Federal Reserve officials continue to opine on the path forward, with Jeffrey Schmid favoring a slower pace of rate reductions and Mary Daly forecasting more cuts. “Gold is one of this year’s strongest-performing commodities, with gains of more than 30% so far supported by rate-cut optimism, strong central-bank buying and robust Asian purchases,” ING Bank NV wrote in a note. “Haven demand amid heightened geopolitical risks, as well as uncertainty ahead of the US election in November, have also supported gold’s record-breaking rally.” Money managers have increased net-long positions in gold, while investors have added to holdings in exchange-traded funds. Citigroup Inc. analysts boosted their three-month price forecast by 3.7% to $2,800 an ounce amid expectations that further labor-market deterioration will drive demand.

The content, which includes baseless accusations about the Minnesota governor's time as a teacher, contains several indications that it was manipulated, said the official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Analysts identified clues that linked the content to Russian disinformation operations, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director. Digital researchers had already linked the video to Russia, but Tuesday’s announcement is the first time federal authorities have confirmed the connection. The disinformation targeting Walz is consistent with Russian disinformation seeking to undermine the Democratic campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz, her running mate. Russia also has spread disinformation aimed at stoking discord and division ahead of voting, officials said, and may seek to encourage violent protests after Election Day. Last month, analysts at Microsoft revealed that a viral video that baselessly claimed Harris left a woman paralyzed in a hit-and-run accident 13 years ago was Russian disinformation. More recently, a video surfaced featuring a man claiming to be a former student of Walz's who accused the candidate of sexual misconduct years ago. Private researchers at firms that track disinformation, including NewsGuard, already have concluded the video was fake and that the man in the footage isn't who he claimed to be. Some researchers have also suggested the video may contain evidence that it was created using artificial intelligence, but federal officials stopped short of the same conclusion, saying only that the video contained multiple indications of manipulation. China and Iran also have sought to influence the U.S. election using online disinformation. While Russia has targeted the Democratic campaign, Iran has gone after Republican Donald Trump with disinformation as well as hacking into the former president's campaign. China, meanwhile, has focused its influence efforts on down-ballot races, and on general efforts to sow distrust and democratic dissatisfaction. There is no indication that Russia, China or Iran are plotting significant attacks on election infrastructure as a way to disrupt the outcome, officials said Tuesday. Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has said improvements to election security mean there is no way any other foreign adversary will be able to alter the results. Russia, China and Iran have all rejected claims that they are seeking to meddle with the U.S. election. Messages left with the Russian embassy seeking comment on the Walz video were not immediately returned Tuesday. ",

The large cut — which is expected by all but one of Canada’s biggest lenders — would signal some urgency to bring the benchmark overnight rate to the so-called neutral level, where it will neither slow nor stimulate the economy. With inflation now lower than the central bank’s 2% target and growth tracking well below the bank’s estimates, restrictive borrowing costs simply aren’t needed. Some analysts also worry that sticking to a gradual easing pace at this point wouldn’t be enough to keep inflation from drifting too low, or might even lead to outright deflation. “Arguably the Bank of Canada is well behind the curve,” Jason Daw, head of North American rates strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said by email. “They had to wait due to inflation uncertainties, but with price growth normalizing quickly, the economy no longer needs the current degree of restrictiveness.” In a news conference after September’s 25 basis-point cut, Macklem opened the door to the possibility of more aggressive action, saying the bank could accelerate the pace of easing if inflation and growth were weaker than expected. So far, that seems to be the case. Yearly price pressures surprisingly decelerated to a 1.6% pace last month, helped by falling gasoline prices. They’ve averaged 2% in the third quarter, below the 2.3% pace forecast in July. At that time, officials expected the economy to grow at a 2.8% annualized clip in the third quarter — preliminary data point to growth closer to 1%. Downside risks to the economy are mounting. While a recession is not the base case expectation of economists or the bank, growth has stagnated and is being propped up by record immigration levels. On average, the economy has been expanding below potential for over a year, opening the so-called output gap and helping to ease price pressures. The labor market is weakening, and while there’s no evidence of widespread layoffs, household spending is being constrained as Canadians continue to renew their mortgages at higher rates.

SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein said a significant part of cloud deals in the quarter included AI use cases. The company has doubled down on efforts to cash in on the technology in recent months, cementing new AI partnerships and expanding existing ones as it seeks to gain an edge over rivals. Advancements in generative AI sparked a wave of investments from tech companies jockeying for position in a rapidly evolving market that looks set to revolutionize the future of business and human labor. SAP last year made investments in three generative AI companies—Aleph Alpha, Anthropic and Cohere—and poached Walter Sun from Microsoft as its global head of AI. SAP said its cloud business had an outstanding performance in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, India, Japan and Spain in the third quarter, while China, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. had also been particularly robust. Reporting on a non-IFRS basis, SAP said total revenue increased 10% at constant currencies to €8.47 billion. Revenue from SAP’s core cloud business jumped 27% to €4.35 billion. Operating profit grew 28% to €2.24 billion. Analysts had forecast total revenue of €8.44 billion, cloud revenue of €4.35 billion and an operating profit of €2.07 billion, according to a non-IFRS consensus provided by the company. SAP, like other European software companies, presents its figures as two sets of numbers. One set is based on the International Financial Reporting Standards—an international accounting method that seeks to provide a global reporting standard—though analysts and investors tend to follow SAP’s non-IFRS numbers, which exclude restructuring expenses and acquisition-related charges.

The company’s Australia-Asia Power Link plans to send 1.75 gigawatts of renewable electricity to Singapore, or about 9% of its current needs, through a 4,300-kilometer (2,670-mile) submarine cable. The Australia-based project, controlled by tech billionaire Mike-Cannon Brookes, is one of the most ambitious developments globally to supply energy-hungry customers in Asia that don’t have the available land to generate enough renewable power. It won approval for its first stage in August. “Conditional approval is a vote of confidence from the Singapore government,” Mitesh Patel, SunCable International’s interim chief executive officer, said in the statement. The company now plans to focus on project planning, talks with industrial customers in Singapore and subsea surveys in Indonesia. Singapore is also holding talks with Australia and clean energy groups on plans to allow the use of credits tied to cross-border electricity imports, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said Tuesday in a statement. The nation aims to import 6 gigawatts of low-carbon power by 2035, and is working to study pathways to deliver high-integrity certificates linked to clean power generated outside of Singapore. Development of a credible framework for the credits would help lift demand for cross-border electricity trading and support investment in renewable projects across the region, the ministry said, without giving a timeline for execution of the proposals.

Jeffries, partner Matthew Smith and their employee James Jacobson ran an international sex trafficking and prostitution business from 2008 to 2015, using Jeffries’ status, wealth and a web of household staffers to fulfill the couple's sexual desires and keep it all secret, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn. “To anyone who thinks they can exploit and coerce others by using the so-called casting couch system, this case should serve as a warning – prepare to trade that couch for a bed in federal prison,” Brooklyn-based U.S. attorney Breon Peace said at a news conference. “Sexually exploiting vulnerable human beings is a crime. And doing so by dangling dreams of a future in fashion and modeling is no different,” he added. The charges follow sexual misconduct allegations, made in lawsuits and the media, from young people who said Jeffries promised modeling work and then pressed them into sex acts. Jeffries' attorney, Brian Bieber, said by email he would “respond in detail to the allegations after the indictment is unsealed, and when appropriate, but plan to do so in the courthouse — not the media.” Messages seeking comment were sent to attorneys for Smith and Jacobson. Jeffries and Smith were arrested in Florida and were due to make an initial court appearance Tuesday afternoon in West Palm Beach. Jacobson was arrested in Wisconsin and due in court in St. Paul, Minnesota. Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace and FBI and police officials were set to hold a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Jeffries, Smith and Jacobson are charged with sex trafficking and interstate prostitution involving 15 unnamed accusers. According to the indictment, they paid for dozens of men to travel within the U.S. and internationally to engage in paid sex with them and other men in New York and at hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco and St. Barts. The indictment describes sexual bacchanals in which the recruited men were given drugs, lubricant, condoms, costumes, sex toys and, sometimes, erection-inducing penile injections that caused painful, hourslong reactions. The men weren't informed of all that the events would entail, including some of the sexual practices they'd be expected to engage in, and they were required to give up their clothes and cell phones during the gatherings and sign non-disclosure agreements afterward, the indictment said.

Sales in North Asia declined 6.5% in the third quarter, said the company, worsening from a decline of 2.4% in the prior three months. \"In mainland China, the beauty market – already negative in the second quarter – continued to deteriorate, impacted by low consumer confidence,\" the company said in a statement.

The decision, based in part due to UK disclosure requirements, was a blow to London’s ambitions to be a magnet for tech companies and its status as a global financial hub. In the aftermath, the UK worked to simplify its listing rules, including allowing companies more autonomy without being subject to shareholder votes. Arm shares have risen nearly 200% since its September 2023 IPO. ‘Strange Bedfellows’ Haas called for more geographic and supplier diversity in the semiconductor industry, which is currently dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Arm relies on its sometime competitor, troubled Intel Corp., according to Haas. The pair might be “strange bedfellows,” but Arm works closely with Intel, he said. “We work very closely with their engineers to make sure that the leading-edge technology can run on Arm,” Haas said. “We want to see Intel successful.” He declined to comment on a Bloomberg News report last month that Arm sought to buy Intel’s product division. Intel, once the world’s largest chipmaker, has struggled in recent years, with its shares dropping to their lowest point since 2010 in September. That month, the firm announced plans to slash 15,000 jobs and scale back factory expansion plans. Arm makes much of its revenue selling chip designs for smartphones, although Haas has sought to broaden its reach outside of that industry.

TechInsights informed TSMC of the chip before publishing its findings in a report, the person said, prompting the Taiwanese firm to notify the U.S. Commerce Department a couple of weeks ago.

        "body": "General Motors (GM) gave investors something to cheer early Tuesday morning after the automaker raised its guidance for a third time this year, in addition to easily beating third quarter revenue and profit expectations. For the quarter, GM reported revenue of $48.78 billion, easily topping estimates of $44.69 billion per Bloomberg consensus and higher than the prior quarter's nearly $48 billion. GM's Q3 revenue was also 10.5% higher than a year ago. The company booked adjusted earnings per share of $2.96, far outstripping expectations of $2.44. It reported EBIT-adjusted profit of $4.115 billion, up 15.5% from a year ago, with EBIT-adjusted margin climbing to 8.4% from 8.1% year over year. GM stock jumped nearly 8% in early trading. In terms of guidance, GM made the following upward revisions to its full-year 2024 forecast: Adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes): $14 billion to $15 billion ($13 billion-$15 billion previously) Automotive operating cash flow: $22 billion to $24 billion ($19.2 billion-$22.2 billion previously) Adjusted automotive free cash flow: $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion ($9.5 billion-$11.5 billion previously) Diluted-adjusted EPS: $10 to $10.50 ($9.50-$10.50 previously) \"I’m proud that GM is delivering our best vehicles ever with strong financial results. But I want to be clear that we are not mistaking progress for winning,\" GM CEO Mary Barra wrote in her letter to shareholders. \"Competition is fierce, and the regulatory environment will keep getting tougher. That’s why we are focused on optimizing our ICE [internal combustion engine vehicle] margins and working to make our EVs profitable on an EBIT basis as quickly as possible.\" GM CFO Paul Jacobson added in a media call with reporters that while the reduction of GM's share count by 19% via buybacks provided a \"tailwind\" to the EPS beat, the profit beat was due more to the earnings power of the company's fundamental business. Jacobson told Yahoo Finance the company would stay aggressive on buybacks in 2025. In Q3, GM delivered 659,601 vehicles, down 2% compared with a year ago; however, retail sales were up 3%. GM said it delivered more vehicles than any other automaker in the US in the quarter. Not surprisingly, GM’s sales of pickups and full-size SUVs led the way, but electric vehicle sales were also a highlight. Amid a drop in sales for the Bolt EV, GM’s other EV models picked up the slack with sales of 32,195 EVs in total, up 60% compared to a year ago. Jacobson said at GM's investor day in early October that the company is still targeting EV profitability on a positive variable profit margin basis, despite the fact that it revised its EV production volume forecast to 200,000 units, at the low end of its previous range of 200,000 to 250,000 units. The company is expecting to trim EV costs by $2 billion to $4 billion in 2025.       ",

This matters because eurodollar markets have played a role in deepening economic downturns across the globe, he said, including the 2008 financial crisis. “There may be more work for those of us in the global regulatory community to ensure resiliency in the offshore eurodollar markets,” Gensler said. Global upheavals have caused the US Federal Reserve to step in as the international lender of last resort to keep foreign financial firms afloat. The Fed shoveled billions of dollars into overseas banks during the Great Financial Crisis to keep the system functioning, and in 2020, it engaged in a massive buying of domestic corporate bonds to stabilize the global dollar-bond market, according to a May report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. In a separate interview with Bloomberg Television, Gensler called for global collaboration to regulate the use of artificial intelligence in finance. With AI’s capabilities increasing exponentially each month, Gensler has repeatedly warned about the potential risk that thousands of banks, brokers, investment advisers and other financial firms will all rely on just a few underlying data sets to design ultimately similar AI systems. It’s important for regulators to consider how to protect against what’s likely to be a “very concentrated interconnected system,” he said. Private Credit The SEC continues to keep a close eye on the burgeoning private credit sector, which now totals $1.7 trillion, he said. “Though private credit has existed in some form for years, given its size has increased significantly, how will it weather times of stress at today’s or greater magnitude?” he asked during the forum. Gensler acknowledged the benefits of private credit, but also highlighted potential risks of its intersection with the traditional banking and insurance sectors.             ",

The jury deliberated for about two hours before handing down the verdict. Larmore faces as long as 20 years in prison for each count at sentencing on March 4, although white-collar criminals rarely receive the statutory maximum. Prosecutors alleged Larmore bought thousands of WeWork options just days before an entity he controlled, Cole Capital Funds LLC, made an offer to buy WeWork stock at $9 a share, which sent the price soaring 150% on Nov. 3. He stood to make millions of dollars on the options, but he mistimed a press release announcing the offer, and his options expired about an hour before the rally, the government said. WeWork had been the fastest-growing co-working company in the world, with millions of square feet of office space and a peak valuation of $47 billion in 2019. But by last year, slumping demand left it with more liabilities than assets. Shares that fetched more than $500 in 2021 were trading at less than $1 in early November, when the company was expected to file for bankruptcy. That’s when Larmore used Cole Capital, which had “no genuine business operations,” to make a bogus tender offer and artificially inflate the value of WeWork shares and options, the government said. Larmore’s attorneys had argued that the offer for WeWork was legitimate and that he never intended to manipulate the market. “Of course we’re disappointed with the jury’s verdict,” Bruce Udolf, one of Larmore’s attorneys, said after the verdict was read. “We respect it and we plan to appeal.” Larmore was a so-called real estate syndicator — a private investor who makes deals in commercial properties using other people’s money. It’s an often overlooked corner of the US market. In 2005, he founded ArciTerra Cos., which acquired strip malls and other retail properties in need of revamping, fixed them up and then refinanced them to raise cash.              ",

Asked why that extra capacity wasn’t added in the U.S., and if the Mexico expansion was an effort to slash spending following a new agreement with the United Auto Workers union, Feuell said it was not a cost-cutting move. “The plant in Saltillo does a really good job managing the complexity and they’re already building pickup trucks down there,” she said. The future home of the Ram 1500 truck, which is currently built at Sterling Heights assembly near Detroit, is under question given the Mexico expansion. Stellantis is not currently building Ram 1500 trucks in Saltillo, Feuell said. She declined to say if they would do so in the future, following a report that the automaker was adding factory space next to the Saltillo facility for that purpose. The automaker's production plans have come under greater scrutiny as the UAW is laying the groundwork for a nationwide walkout against Stellantis, claiming it has not kept its contract promises. The company said it has kept its commitments, and has in turn sued the UAW in federal court over its allegations. Stellantis is in the midst of significant leadership changes as CEO Carlos Tavares attempts to turn around sliding sales and profit in North America ahead of his planned 2026 departure. The car company's shares are down about 44% year to date. Tavares indicated earlier this year he was ready to axe any of its 14 brands that isn't performing. Feuell said Chrysler's positioning is strong. \"Chrysler has a very well-funded product and technology roadmap,\" she said. (Reporting by Nora EckertEditing by Bill Berkrot) ",

        "body": "(Reuters) -Mike Jeffries, the former chief executive of Abercrombie & Fitch, has been indicted on sex trafficking and prostitution involving dozens of men. The charges were unveiled on Tuesday, a decade after Jeffries left the retailer he built over 22 years into a popular clothing brand known for sexually charged marketing. Jeffries, his partner Matthew Smith, and a third defendant James Jacobson, who allegedly served as a recruiter, were each charged with one count of sex trafficking and 15 counts of interstate prostitution. Jeffries and Smith are expected to appear later Tuesday in federal court in Florida, court records show. All three defendants were arrested on Tuesday. Brian Bieber, a lawyer for Jeffries, said in an email he would respond in detail to the charges in court. Lawyers for Smith did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Jacobson could not immediately be reached for comment. Abercrombie declined to comment. According to the indictment, between 2008 and 2015 Jeffries and Smith paid for dozens of men to meet them for sex in New York and at hotels in England, France, Italy, Morocco, Saint Barthelemy and elsewhere, in the hope it would advance their modeling careers. Relying on their \"vast\" financial resources and Jeffries' power at Abercrombie, Jeffries and Smith ran a business \"dedicated to fulfilling their sexual desires and ensuring that their international sex trafficking and prostitution business was kept secret, thereby maintaining Jeffries' powerful reputation,\" the indictment said. Prosecutors said Jacobson typically conducted \"tryouts\" where male recruits would first have sex with him. They also said the scheme involved the use of muscle relaxants known as \"poppers,\" large sex toys and high-pressured enemas, among other things. Men were also required to sign non-disclosure agreements, and pay damages if they told anyone including family and friends what went on. The probe was led by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York. Last year, a group of once-aspiring Abercrombie models sued Abercrombie, Jeffries and Smith in Manhattan federal court, saying in a proposed class action that the New Albany, Ohio-based company benefited from Jeffries' sex trafficking. David Bradberry, the named plaintiff, said Jeffries forced models to take drugs and engage in sex for a chance to appear in Abercrombie catalogs, while the company paid off people who accused Jeffries of sexual abuse or harassment. Jeffries led Abercrombie from 1992 to 2014, making it a successful teen apparel maker known for cologne-filled stores and ads featuring semi-nude models.   ",

If you are looking for more investing related content, I guarantee you’ll enjoy my content on 𝕏, @LogicalThesis. Thanks for reading! Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become a popular method for startups to raise capital in the cryptocurrency space. By issuing new digital tokens in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, projects can fund their development. Here’s a brief overview of ICOs, how they work, their benefits, and associated risks. An ICO is a fundraising mechanism where new projects sell tokens to investors in exchange for capital. These tokens can represent utility, security, or other digital assets based on blockchain technology. Project Development: A startup creates a blockchain-based project. Whitepaper Creation: The team drafts a whitepaper detailing the project’s purpose and the ICO specifics. Token Sale Launch: The ICO is announced, allowing investors to purchase tokens at a set price during a specified period. Raising Funds: Investors contribute cryptocurrencies, funding the project’s development. Post-ICO Trading: Tokens are often listed on exchanges for trading after the ICO. Access to Capital: Startups can quickly raise funds without traditional barriers. Global Reach: ICOs allow a diverse range of investors to participate. Potential Returns: Early investors may see significant gains if the project succeeds. Regulatory Issues: ICOs often lack regulation, exposing investors to scams. Market Volatility: Tokens can lose value rapidly, risking investor capital. Project Viability: Many projects fail to deliver on their promises, leading to losses. ICOs gained popularity around 2017-2018, attracting regulatory scrutiny. In response, alternatives like Security Token Offerings (STOs) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) have emerged, providing more regulated fundraising options. ICOs offer a unique opportunity for innovation and investment in the blockchain space, but they come with significant risks. Investors should conduct thorough research before participating, especially as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. Understanding ICOs and their alternatives is essential for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic market.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were both off about 0.1%. Stocks are coming under pressure amid growing doubts that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut rates aggressively — or even hold steady in November. Strength in the economy, cautious Fedspeak, and concerns about the fiscal impact of an election win by Republican nominee Donald Trump are factors in play. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Amid the uncertainty, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) steadied around 4.2% after Monday's sharp gains helped push it above that level for the first time since July. The bond selling has weighed on rate-sensitive stocks such as real estate, with rising yields typically a catalyst for stock drawdowns. On the earnings front, General Motors (GM) raised its guidance for the third time this year as upbeat EV sales helped deliver a quarterly profit and revenue beat. GM shares were up more than 9%. Elsewhere in earnings, GE Aerospace (GE) fell over 7% and Verizon shares fell around 5% on mixed third quarter reports. At the same time, anticipation is building for earnings from Tesla (TSLA) on Wednesday as Wall Street debates whether the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech megacaps will lead stocks' next leg higher. Despite higher yields, gold (GC=F) prices rose, on track to reclaim Monday's record high. The gains came as investors sought safety with the US presidential election looming and Middle East tensions still on the rise. Energy (XLE), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Real Estate (XLRE) led Tuesday's sector action, with markets retreating for their second straight session as traders priced in a higher for longer policy stance from the Federal Reserve. Oil prices were a standout, with WTI crude (CL=F) rising about 3% to trade above $72.50 a barrel. Brent crude (BZ=F), the international benchmark, rose more than 2% to trade just above $76 a barrel. Information technology (XLI), Materials (XLB), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) served as the day's biggest laggards. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that the global economy is on pace for a soft landing this year and 2025 but elections around the world introduce a \"high\" level of uncertainty to that outlook due to potential changes in trade and fiscal policy. The IMF said an increase in global tariffs could exacerbate trade tensions, disrupt global supply chains, and weigh down medium-term growth prospects by limiting positive spillovers from innovation and technology transfer that once fueled growth in emerging markets and developing economies. Read more here. Treasury yields spiked over the last month amid a slew of stronger-than-expected economic data and signs that inflation's path down toward the Fed's 2% goal may take longer than initially hoped. The data has pushed the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) up nearly 50 basis points in the past month to hover near 4.2%, its highest level since July. As our graph below shows, the debate among investors appears to be more about how quickly the Fed will reduce interest rates over the next year than whether the central bank will cut once again in November. As of Tuesday morning, markets were still pricing in a roughly 88% chance that the Fed cuts rates at its November meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. But by the end of next year, markets see the Fed likely making one less cut than was priced in on Oct. 4 and two less cuts than markets were projecting on Sept. 18, the day the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point. General Motors (GM) stock rose more than 7% on Tuesday morning as the automaker boosted its profitability guidance for a third time this year. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: For the quarter, GM reported revenue of $48.78 billion, easily topping estimates of $44.69 billion per Bloomberg consensus, and higher than the prior quarter's nearly $48 billion. GM's Q3 revenue was also 10.5% higher than a year ago. The company booked adjusted earnings per share of $2.96, far outstripping expectations of $2.44.

Novatek has been pressing ahead with its new Arctic LNG 2 project despite Western sanctions restricting access to the tankers it needs to carry LNG along the Northern Sea Route to Asian markets. Loadings of Russian LNG will be prohibited in EU ports from March 2025. To address its shortage of vessels able to navigate Arctic waters, Russia plans to have those it does have unload their cargoes to regular vessels at sea, freeing them up for new shipments, the draft seen by Reuters showed. Novatek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to the draft, the first area for ship-to-ship transfers will be set up near the Chosha Bay in the Barents Sea for Obsky Ammiak, a subsidiary of Novatek. Russia then plans to set up a second facility with the samecapacity in Kresta Bay in the Bering Sea, the draft showed. Transfers - which will only happen when ship movement is not hindered by ice - will allow for the loadings of 4.1 million cubic metres of LNG and 1.4 mcm of gas condensate a year in each facility, the document showed. Novatek already uses the same scheme to perform ship-to-ship LNG transfers off the coast of Russia's Murmansk region. (Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Jan Harvey) ",

The U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), a federal government body that studies risks in AI systems, was created in November 2023 as a part of President Joe Biden's AI Executive Order. The AISI operates within NIST, an agency of the Commerce Department that develops guidance for the deployment of various categories of technologies. But while the AISI has a budget, a director, and a research partnership with its counterpart in the U.K., the U.K. AI Safety Institute, it could be wound down with a simple repeal of Biden's executive order. \"If another president were to come into office and repeal the AI Executive Order, they would dismantle the AISI,\" Chris MacKenzie, senior director of communications at Americans for Responsible Innovation, an AI lobby group, told TechCrunch. \"And [Donald] Trump has promised to repeal the AI Executive Order. So Congress formally authorizing the AI Safety Institute would ensure its continued existence regardless of who's in the White House.\" Beyond assuring the AISI's future, authorizing the office could also lead to more stable, long-term funding for its initiative from Congress. The AISI currently has a budget of around $10 million — a relatively small amount considering the concentration of major AI labs in Silicon Valley. \"Appropriators in Congress tend to give higher budgeting priority to entities formally authorized by Congress,\" MacKenzie said, \"with the understanding that those entities have broad buy-in and are here for the long run, rather than just a single administration's one-off priority.\" In a letter today, a coalition of over 60 companies, nonprofits, and universities called on Congress to enact legislation codifying the AISI before the end of the year. Among the undersigners are OpenAI and Anthropic, both of which have signed agreements with the AISI to collaborate on AI research, testing, and evaluation. The Senate and House have each advanced bipartisan bills to authorize the activities of the AISI. But the proposals have faced some opposition from conservative lawmakers including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who's called for the Senate version of the AISI bill to pull back on diversity programs. Granted, the AISI is a relatively weak organization from an enforcement perspective. Its standards are voluntary. But think tanks and industry coalitions — as well as tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and IBM, all of which signed the aforementioned letter — see the AISI as the most promising avenue to AI benchmarks that can form the basis of future policy.

But total revenue was essentially flat from a year earlier at $33.3 billion, slightly under analysts’ expectations of $33.4 billion, as service revenue and other growth was offset by declines in wireless equipment revenue. It was the second consecutive quarter that lower equipment revenue overshadowed other gains. The stock slid 4.1% Tuesday late-morning in New York. “The downturn in equipment sales is tied to a lack of compelling new hardware features from the smartphone makers, leading to a marked reduction in switching and lower churn,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote in a recent note. Telecom executives, including Verizon Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg, have said they didn’t expect Apple Inc.’s latest iPhone, which came out in September, to spur a significant upgrade cycle. Apple’s iPhone 16 offers only modest hardware upgrades, and its advanced artificial intelligence technology will only be gradually added to the device via incremental software updates. Vestberg said it’s still unclear whether the promises of AI capabilities in new iPhone models will convince people to upgrade. Historically, consumers have been persuaded to trade in their devices by hardware redesigns or a significant network evolution such as 5G. “Is the software side going to do that?” Vestberg asked on a video presentation to analysts on Tuesday. “It’s too early for us to say. So far we haven’t seen that it is creating the cycle.” Customers used to upgrade every 12 months but now they are keeping their phones for more than 40 months, Vestberg had said previously. As the pool of potential new wireless customers tightens, New York-based Verizon has been offering customizable mobile and broadband plans and throwing in perks such as savings on streaming services like Netflix and Max. The company is also pushing its fixed wireless product, which delivers high-speed internet over the airwaves rather than through lines into the home. Vestberg said this “convergence” of plans and products has been attractive to customers and leads to lower churn, or customers leaving for rivals.                ",

The CEO of the largest U.S. bank has long been floated for senior positions on U.S. economic policy.

But I always reserve the right\" to reconsider, he said. Dimon took the reins at JPMorgan in 2006. He has emphasized that he and the rest of the board will \"do the right thing\" on succession when he eventually leaves, without specifying details. He has been outspoken on economic and policy matters and has often celebrated American exceptionalism, including in his widely read annual letter in April. \"I've always been an American patriot and my country is more important to me than my company,\" he told analysts on a call this month.

While some rival automakers are cutting prices and boosting incentives to reduce inventory, GM has been able to hold the line on high-demand vehicles like its gas-powered GMC Yukon SUV and Chevy Silverado pickup. Profits from those models more than offset losses from a growing electric vehicle business and continued red ink in China. “Our year-over-year performance has been very strong,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said on a call with reporters. “We’ve been able to grow retail share with above average prices, below average incentives and well managed inventory. This has put us in a position to update guidance once again.” Industry-wide US new vehicle sales have fallen for the past two quarters, with the decline accelerating to 1.9% in the most recent three-month period. High sticker prices and financing costs are dissuading some would-be buyers. But GM has been able to maintain its margins with a combination of price discipline and well-managed inventories. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, GM said its net income came in flat at $3 billion, or $2.96 a share on an adjusted basis, up from $2.28 a year ago and also above the $2.45 per share average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the company rose 8.2% — the biggest jump in nine months — to $52.95 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York. The stock is up about 47% this year. GM hiked its adjusted automotive cash flow guidance for all of 2024 to a range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, a significant boost from a prior projected high of $11.5 billion. With that kind of cash expected to come in, it has stepped up stock buybacks, repurchasing almost 250 million shares over the past year. That’s a big reason for the per-share adjusted earnings beat and gains from a year ago, the company said. On a net basis, the carmaker actually trimmed the high end of its full-year outlook slightly by $300 million to $11.1 billion.                  ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the US will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Fouquet said in an interview during the Bloomberg Tech Summit in London on Tuesday. “The question is what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?” Washington has for years sought to limit China’s rise in the semiconductor sector, through repeated rounds of export controls that have targeted the sale of advanced artificial intelligence chips and chipmaking equipment. The Dutch government has struggled to find a middle ground between its US ally and its top company’s biggest market. Fouquet said much of ASML’s business with China is focused on mature technology that is less relevant to national security concerns. “A lot of the focus in China today is on mainstream semiconductors,” he said. “This is very different from AI.” ASML has a monopoly on making the lithography machines that help the world’s largest semiconductor companies to produce the advanced chips that power everything from Apple Inc.’s smartphones to Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerators. China has never been able to buy ASML’s most advanced machines, which use extreme ultraviolet, or EUV technology. The Netherlands has also restricted ASML from selling some of its second most-advanced immersion DUV lithography systems to China and last month published new export control rules that made ASML apply for export licenses in The Hague. China relies on ASML’s systems to advance its chip-making technology, as the country has not yet been able to develop similar equipment capable of producing cutting-edge semiconductors. Fouquet said the existing restrictions mean China is “10 to 15 years behind when it comes to advanced technology.” China was ASML’s biggest market for the last five quarters, accounting for €2.79 billion ($3 billion) of sales in the most recent period, nearly half of ASML’s total. Fouquet said that Chinese demand had been elevated due to a backlog that dated to orders placed during the Covid-19 pandemic. ASML expects sales to the country will shrink to about 20% of total revenue next year, a level that it considers more normal.                     ",

Small business owners should stay alert too and recognize that the scammers can strike both online and in person. “We’ve seen an uptick in cyberattacks during disasters,” said Jennifer Butler, partner in disaster recovery at global advisory firm EisnerAmper. “Small businesses should really pay attention to that, really be aware of scams, of phishing attempts or potential cyberattacks on their systems. Because this is the time when, you know, those bad actors are going to come after small businesses.” Because small businesses might have a variety of employees and contractors coming and going after a disaster as they seek to mitigate damage and reopen, owners should be vigilant about verifying the identity of anyone they're working with. “Always ask for ID, documentation, those kinds of things,” Butler said. No one should be asking for payment up front, particularly anyone that says they're from a government organization such as the Small Business Administration. “Make sure you’re not paying anybody to help you if they’re saying that they’re from the federal government,” she added. Florida officials have said there are reports of scammers in the area who are posing as Federal Emergency Management Agency officials and trying to get financial information from the storm’s victims.

While officials aren’t offering many pointers on how rapidly or by how much borrowing costs will fall from here, investors are betting on quarter-point moves at the next four meetings and a deposit rate of 2% by mid-2025. Fueling such wagers are indications that inflation could sustainably reach the 2% target sooner than thought. France’s Francois Villeroy de Galhau has suggested that the goal may actually be achieved as early as the start of next year. Speaking separately, Governing Council member Robert Holzmann said a faster-than-expected retreat in prices will allow the ECB to lower rates again before too long. His Portuguese counterpart Mario Centeno said officials would be ready consider ramping up monetary easing should data suggest such a move. Money markets added to loosening bets, with traders betting on 32 basis points of cuts in December and 58 basis points by January, compared with 30 basis points and 56 basis points before. That implies a 28% chance of a half-point move in December. Inflation eased below 2% in September for the first time since 2021 due to tumbling energy costs. There are lingering worries, though, as wage growth and services prices remain elevated. A temporary uptick in inflation is expected in the coming months and Lagarde, despite her optimism, still had some words of caution.               ",

In recent years, the United States has escalated its use of export controls, aiming to thwart Chinese companies from obtaining, designing, or manufacturing advanced semiconductors. Huawei, a primary target of these efforts, epitomizes the growing technology rivalry between Beijing and Washington.

Adjusted earnings per share of $3.24 was up 23% from 2023’s third quarter. Revenue was up 3%. The railroad’s positive results came despite challenges arising from Hurricane Helene, which the company said had the greatest impact on its rail network since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. George said the “fast and effective actions” of NS railroaders “resulted in us being able to recover and serve our communities within days.” While the railroad’s line into Asheville, North Carolina, is likely to remain closed for months, its key routes were reopened within 72 hours. Recovery efforts included clearing more than 15,000 downed trees, dealing with more than 1,000 locations where commercial power was out and replacing some 150 tons of ballast. About 35 miles of track sustained damage, along with five bridges and 54 slide fences. Chief Operating Officer John Orr highlighted efficiency and cost control moves including a reduction of 130 crew starts per day and a 20% reduction in overtime. The improved productivity has allowed the railroad to store 500 locomotives so far this year — an increase of 200 from the second quarter — as well as reduce the number of cars online by 1,000 during the quarter and 8,000 in the year to date. George said the resulting fluidity was reflected in the ability to recover from Helene. “I would tell you a year ago some of the events we saw in the quarter would have set us back three months,” he said. “But we were back within a week. And now we’re actually at record network speeds and low dwell.” Dwell is at 22.5 hours, down from 23.2 in the third quarter a year ago and a high of 24.6 hours in the fourth quarter of 2023. Train speed is at 22.3 mph systemwide and 20 mph for merchandise, compared to 20.5 mph for the system and 18.1 for merchandise in 2023’s third quarter. Car-miles per day has risen to 114 from 101 in the same quarter a year ago. The railroad’s overall volume was up 7%, with a 2% gain in merchandise (563,900 carloads) and 3% gain in merchandise revenue ($1.86 billion). Intermodal volume (1,052,200 units) was up 9%, with revenue ($763 million) up 4%. Coal volume was up 11% at 185,300, but revenue was down 2% at $427 million.      ",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Shares of former U.S. President Donald Trump's media company (DJT) surged to their highest since July on Tuesday as betting odds favored the Republican candidate in his bid for reelection to the White House. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, which operates the Truth Social app, jumped 9% to $34.17, and the stock has nearly tripled since sinking to an all-time low in late September. Since its listing, Trump Media has been popular with traders who view it as a speculative bet on Trump winning the Nov. 5 election. He owns 57% of the company, making his stake now worth almost $4 billion. Trump Media's revenue in the June quarter was $837,000 and the company is burning cash. Strategists say its nearly $7 billion stock market value is detached from its day-to-day business. As of mid-day, traders had exchanged $1.1 billion worth of Trump Media shares, in line with a recent surge in trading volume, according to LSEG data. Trump's odds of beating Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, in election have recently edged higher on betting websites, though opinion polls show the race is a dead heat. Oddschecker.com, which reflects odds across a number of betting platforms, had Trump at the equivalent of about a 62% chance of winning and Harris at about 38%. On the PredictIt platform, contracts for a Trump victory traded at 60 cents, with a potential $1 payout. Harris contracts were at 46 cents. Polymarket has Trump with a 64% chance of winning and Harris at 36%, with a combined $2.2 billion in volume. One of four accounts on Polymarket that have fueled speculation over their large bets on a Trump victory added to its wagers Tuesday, increasing the potential payout if Trump wins to nearly $44 million, according to Polymarket's activity tracker. With just two weeks left before the election, Harris held a marginal 46% to 43% lead over Trump in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Other polls show the two candidates neck and neck in the seven battleground states that are expected to determine the winner. Trump Media saw its value briefly balloon to nearly $10 billion following its March stock market debut through a tie-up with a blank-check company.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) — Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic is releasing a new tool that can understand what’s happening on a user’s computer screen and complete a range of online tasks for them — the latest example of tech companies expanding from chatbots that offer pithy responses to so-called AI agents that can act on a person’s behalf.The new capability, called “computer use,” can interpret what a user is seeing on their computer and — with permission — take actions for them by browsing the web, clicking buttons and typing, Anthropic said Tuesday. The company is releasing a beta version to developers using its Claude technology, after testing the service with a limited set of enterprise customers in recent weeks. A growing number of AI companies are investing in building agents that field tasks for users with minimal human supervision, an attempt to fulfill the promise of artificial intelligence to radically increase productivity in our personal and professional lives. On Monday, Microsoft Corp. launched a set of agent tools designed to send emails and manage records for workers. Salesforce Inc. touted its enterprise agent apps for customer service at its Dreamforce event last month.Anthropic is taking a different approach than many other companies have with agent tools. Rather than integrate with various applications on the backend, its technology can process what’s happening on a user’s computer screen in real time. The company said this method creates a more intuitive experience.“It’s going to be the first model ever to be able to use a computer the way that people do,” Jared Kaplan, co-founder and chief science officer at Anthropic, said in an interview with Bloomberg News. In a pre-recorded demo, an Anthropic employee used the tool to figure out the logistics of taking a friend for a morning hike with views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Anthropic’s AI agent was able to search on Google to find hikes, map a route, check the sunrise time and send a calendar invite with details including what kind of clothing to wear — all with no human input beyond an initial prompt. Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-conscious AI company, but the new tool might invite added scrutiny. Technology that can access a user’s screen activity comes with heightened safety and security concerns. When Microsoft, for example, unveiled its AI-enabled “Recall” feature that created a record of everything users do on their computers, a backlash ensued over worries that the software could be vulnerable to hacking. It ended up relaunching the product with security upgrades.        ",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Walmart (WMT) said on Tuesday it will now deliver prescription medicines and medication refills as a single order along with groceries and other items as soon as 30 minutes, as part of its new express delivery option. The retail bellwether's latest move comes a couple of weeks after technology giant Amazon.com (AMZN) announced its plans to open pharmacies with same-day delivery options across 20 new U.S. cities in 2025. Walmart's previous efforts to dispatch prescription medications typically took at least five to seven business days, while an overnight delivery upon request was charged an additional $15. The company, which has nearly 4,600 store locations with pharmacies, said the new delivery option is available in six states, namely Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin. It would be delivering in 49 states by the end of January next year. Walmart Plus members will receive free delivery, while non-members will have to pay a standard charge of $9.95. The retailer added customers have the option to choose on-demand or express delivery, where the items would be available as soon as 30 minutes, or same-day delivery, where the order can be scheduled for a specific time. \"Customers will be able to seamlessly add prescriptions along with other items from their local Walmart in a single order, available both in-app and online,\" the company said. It will offer all medications except controlled substances, those that need refrigeration and Medicare Part B items that cover services such as outpatient care. Healthcare firm CVS Health offers free same-day delivery to customers with its membership program, CarePass. Pharmacy chain Walgreens offers 24-hour delivery along with groceries and over-the-counter medications, among other items. Earlier this year, Walmart said it would close all 51 of its health clinics and its virtual healthcare operations, as it did not see the business model as sustainable to continue.

Their influence reaches deep into U.S. society. But one market they are not tapping into is betting on government elections. No U.S. state currently allows the practice ahead of the 2024 vote. More from Sportico.com Trump's Threat to Pull Broadcast Licenses Is a Long Shot Diamond-FanDuel Naming Rights Cleared as Marlins Renew With RSN Endeavor Document Sees 70% Sales Growth by 2028, TKO to $3.8B However, companies such as Sequoia-backed Kalshi, PredictIt and financial tech giant Robinhood offer workaround entries into the market through political event futures contract trading. For now, these trades are overseen by a federal agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), but the practice faces accusations of being a form of gambling. Kalshi is in a legal battle with the CFTC, though it could be several months until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals hears oral arguments. By applying futures trading to politics, firms are lapping up revenue, while BetMGM, Caesars, DraftKings, FanDuel and other U.S. betting leaders stay out of the lucrative line of business. As of Friday, Kalshi has taken more than $142 million in wagers on the presidential election winner and $18 million on the popular vote winner. Those numbers are expected to balloon further before Tuesday’s vote. On futures trading platforms, users can buy contracts for Donald Trump or Kamala Harris winning the 2024 presidential election at a price set by how much public money has been placed on either side. Each contract is priced at a fraction of $1; as of Friday morning, a Trump victory contract on Kalshi costs about $0.56, giving him an implied 56% chance of defeating Harris. Users with Trump contracts can either sell each contract as its value changes, or wait until the result is determined and receive a full $1 per contract if Trump wins. If Trump loses, those contract owners get nothing. At its current price, a Trump triumph would pay out about $0.44 per contract in winnings—the difference between a user’s initial payment and $1. The companies offering these trades make money through transaction fees. Until recently, the most-sought futures were generally tied to global economic indicators such as oil prices, treasury notes and currency exchange rates, used as a means of hedging against other investments. Kalshi has hosted more than 185.5 million futures trades on political outcomes since Oct. 4, according to data the company shared with Sportico. It has also cracked the Apple App Store’s top five of free U.S. downloads, advertising itself as a way to “bet the 2024 election,” while simultaneously arguing in court and in a statement to Sportico that it is not a gambling enterprise.

I would say it’s quite favorable in Asia-Pacific. We see similar trends in India,” said Mark Galardo, president of cargo, during a call-in briefing with analysts about the company’s earnings. “And those really kind of stand out in terms of weakness or any areas of concern, none at this time. And we think this cargo tailwind continues into Q4 and the early part of next year.” His comments echo the head of DHL Global Forwarding in the Americas, who said last month that air exports from Asia to North America are expected to remain strong into the first quarter. Higher revenues from six Boeing 767-300 converted freighters on North and South American routes also contributed to the higher cargo revenue, which was partly offset by lower revenue in the trans-Atlantic market, according to Air Canada’s (TSX: AC) earnings report. “Our right-sized network and freighter-to-belly commercial model are producing solid financial results that we believe are sustainable in the long run. We’re confident that cargo will continue to perform well,” Galardo said, referring to Air Canada’s ability to reach more customers by using the passenger network to feed cargo jets in Toronto; Vancouver, British Columbia; and other main hubs. Earlier this year, Air Canada Cargo removed two newly purchased Boeing 767-300 freighters from its fleet to align operations with market demand and reduce negative cash flow. In May, Canada’s flag carrier canceled orders with an aerospace firm to convert two 767 aircraft to freighters, citing the drop in demand as the primary reason. The move followed last September’s cancellation of an order with Boeing for two production 777 cargo jets, which are much larger than the 767. Air Canada is likely to pick up more cargo business over the Pacific Ocean with the resumption of daily service from Vancouver to Shanghai and Beijing on Dec. 7. An announcement this week said the flights will be operated with Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The new flights were made possible after Canada and China recently lifted traffic limits. Airlines and logistics companies are riding a strong demand wave for air transport this year, with volumes about 11% higher for the first nine months of the year compared to 2023. E-commerce, perishable and other shipments have been filling aircraft on trunk routes out of China and other parts of Asia to Europe and North America.

        "body": "LONDON (AP) — Worries about this week's tax-raising U.K. budget within financial markets appeared to ease Friday with the interest rates charged on British debt steadying and the pound rising against most other currencies. In the wake of Wednesday's budget statement, the first by a Labour government for 14 years, British financial assets have been choppy, with investors taking a more risk-averse approach by selling both government bonds and the pound. The budget saw taxes raised by 40 billion pounds ($52 billion), proportionately the biggest for over three decades, and borrowing and spending increased — a combination that clearly unnerved some investors. Some analysts voiced worries about the potential inflationary impact of the budget, which may prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates more slowly than previously anticipated. Though the bank is widely expected to reduce its main interest rate next week by a further quarter-point to 4.75%, the markets have moved to price in fewer reductions next year in the wake of the budget. Other analysts said the public finances will likely need to be bolstered again in coming years if the U.K.'s economic growth doesn't pick up. The Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent watchdog, said in its assessment of the budget that the measures would do little to boost growth levels over the coming years. On Friday, the yield, or interest rate, charged on the U.K.'s 10-year bonds held steady at 4.45%, following increases since Treasury chief Rachel Reeves presented the budget. The pound meanwhile was up 0.4% to $1.2951. Ahead of the statement, Reeves was clearly aware of how a budget can go wrong and prompt panic in financial markets. Two years ago, the short-lived premiership of Liz Truss foundered after a series of unfunded tax cuts sent borrowing costs surging. “Though the market’s allergic reaction is unwelcome for the new Labour government, the response has been much more muted than after the Conservative’s mini-Budget of September 2022. ” said Andrew Goodwin, chief U.K. economist at Oxford Economics. The overall increase in taxes announced by Reeves comes in large part from an increase in a tax businesses pay for employing people. The 1.2 percentage-point increase in employers' national insurance contributions, along with the fact that the levy will be paid on lower incomes, is forecast to raise 25 billion pounds. Many executives have expressed concern about the move, arguing that it may depress wages by prompting firms to seek a way of absorbing the additional costs. The center-left Labour Party won a landslide election victory July 4 after promising to end years of turmoil and scandal under successive Conservative governments, get Britain’s economy growing and restore frayed public services. But the scale of the measures announced on Wednesday by Reeves exceeded Labour’s cautious general election campaign. ",

        "body": "HC Wainwright initiated coverage on Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNDA), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical firm primarily focusing on neurological and neuropsychiatry disorders. HC Wainwright sees Vanda as having a well-established commercial portfolio, with multiple line extensions and life cycle management opportunities across its three key franchises: Fanapt, Hetlioz, and Ponvory. The analyst notes a pipeline of promising programs with numerous opportunities for significant clinical and regulatory milestones expected over the next 6 to 18 months. Vanda trades at a nearly 30% discount to its cash reserves, giving it a negative enterprise value—a surprising valuation given its strong sales and projected profitability runway through late 2026, even if only some of its clinical and commercial projects succeed. HC Wainwright initiates with a Buy rating with a price target of $18. Vanda's value proposition, however, has been obscured by the ongoing generic competition within its sleep disorder portfolio centered around Hetlioz (tasimelteon) and a recent FDA Complete Response Letter (CRL) for tradipitant in gastroparesis, the analyst notes. Hetlioz, while forecast to bring in about $75 million in 2024 sales, is assumed to decline post-2028; however, ongoing litigation could slow generic entry, and Vanda may expand tasimelteon's indications. In October, Cycle Pharmaceuticals reaffirmed its proposal to acquire Vanda Pharmaceuticals for an all-cash consideration of $8.00 per share. However, Vanda declined to accept the offer. Earlier this year, Future Pak withdrew its proposal to purchase the company. The analyst says past M&A offers indicate that Vanda is intrinsically undervalued and may become an attractive M&A target for one or more mid-size pharmaceutical firms if its near—and medium-term pipeline and product portfolio initiatives are successful. \"Given the negative enterprise value at which Vanda trades despite the continued traction of its marketed products and the risk-mitigated nature of its pipeline and LCM initiatives, we find it difficult to visualize substantial downside risk from current levels,\" HC Wainwright says.

Waters Corp. shares surged after the analytical instrument supplier posted strong third-quarter results, benefitting from sales growth across all regions and markets. Virginia-based utility AES Corp. reported a year-over-year decline in revenue, and its shares tumbled.  Following a pair of negative trading sessions, major U.S. equities indexes closed out the week on a strong note, pushing higher on Friday as investors cheered upbeat earnings results from e-commerce and cloud computing behemoth Amazon (AMZN). The S&P 500 added 0.4% to wrap up the trading week and kick off November. The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Shares of Waters Corp. (WAT), a provider of analytical laboratory instruments and software, surged 19.8% on Friday to a 52-week high, delivering the top daily performance in the S&P 500. The gains for Waters stock came after the life, materials, food, and environmental sciences supplier reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and earnings per share (EPS). Cable TV, mobile, and internet service provider Charter Communications (CHTR) also topped sales and profit estimates with its third-quarter results, and its shares jumped 11.9%. The company posted a solid increase in mobile customers, and although Charter lost subscribers to its internet and video services, declines in those areas were less significant than analysts anticipated. Despite Friday's rally, Charter shares remain in negative territory for 2024. Although semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) posted a third-quarter loss, reflecting the impact of impairment and restructuring charges, its sales for the period came in ahead of forecasts, and its shares gained 7.8%. Intel also struck a positive tone regarding the future of its server and PC businesses, issuing better-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter. The company has benefitted from an uptick in PC demand driven by the launch of on-device AI features. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares dropped 10.5%, the heaviest loss of any S&P 500 constituent. Friday's plunge extended steep losses posted by the stock earlier this week as accounting firm EY resigned from its role as auditor for the server and data storage company. Questions about Supermicro's accounting practices came to the forefront over the summer when short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging manipulation by the company.   ",

Total production at Integrated Gas fell 4% quarter over quarter (Q/Q) to 941 kboe/d, and Upstream rose 2% Q/Q at 1,811 kboe/d. RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria reiterated the Outperform rating on Shell, with a price forecast of 3,500 pence. The analyst highlighted that the earnings beat was notable for being broad-based rather than reliant on a single division. Borkhataria projects management to look through softer quarters and maintain buybacks at $3.5 billion per quarter through next year. According to the analyst, strong performance in the LNG division and resilient upstream earnings contributed to the positive results. Additionally, net debt (excluding leases) has fallen to just under $9 billion, the lowest level in over a decade. Also Read: Shell’s Solid Q3 Performance: Strong Revenue, $3.5 Billion Buyback, And Refined Capex Guidance They also mentioned that positive commentary on shareholder returns supports the stock, and Shell’s strong balance sheet offers flexibility in a potential downturn. This positions the company to maintain share buybacks even in a weaker macro environment, and the analyst anticipates that the contrast with its peers will become more apparent by 2025. Scotiabank Global Equity Research analyst Paul Y. Cheng reiterated the Outperform rating on Shell, with a price forecast of $80. The earnings beat was broad-based, with Shell exceeding consensus estimates in all key segments, including Upstream, Integrated Gas, Marketing, and Chemicals & Products. The only exception was the smaller Renewables and Energy Solutions division, which slightly fell short of the market’s expectations. The analyst noted that Shell repurchased $3.5 billion in shares during the third quarter, meeting expectations. Cheng also indicated that the company is likely to maintain its current buyback pace despite a less favorable outlook for commodity prices.

        "body": "The US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (AdCom) has again voted against the approval of Lexicon Pharmaceutical’s Zynquista (sotagliflozin). The AdCom voted 3-11 against Zynquista as an add-on treatment to insulin therapy for managing blood glucose levels in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The committee noted that the therapy’s benefits do not outweigh its risks. Following the latest AdCom vote, Lexicon’s stock was down by 38.7% at market open today (1 November), compared to market close on 30 October, as trading was suspended yesterday (31 October) on account of the AdCom vote. The FDA had previously convened an AdCom to evaluate Zynquista’s efficacy in 2019. The panel voted 8-8 to decide whether the drug's overall benefits outweighed the associated risks. The FDA ultimately declined to approve Zynquista at that time. The company provided additional data of the matched type 2 diabetes (T2D)-CKD population from the SCORED trial (NCT03315143) in the most recent AdCom, along with post hoc subgroup analysis from the three Tandem studies. Zynquista is an oral dual inhibitor of the sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2), which play a role in glucose uptake and reabsorption. In 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the therapy as an adjunct treatment to insulin in T1D and CKD. The therapy is also approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure in patients with either heart failure or T2D, CKD and other cardiovascular risk factors. It is marketed as Inpefa for the cardiovascular indication. Lexicon is seeking approval for Zynquista in patients with T1D and CKD who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45 to less than 60 or an eGFR of greater than 60 with a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of 30 or greater. While the FDA AdCom was not convinced of Zynquista’s efficacy in this population, some members did note that therapy’s benefit outweighed its risks in a subpopulation of patients who had an eGFR of 60 to less than 90 and those who have mild to moderate kidney disease. However, experts wanted more data to establish Zynquista’s efficacy in the subpopulation. An AdCom is convened upon request of the FDA to review and evaluate the safety and efficacy data of a particular therapy. However, the AdCom recommendations are non-binding, with the final decision ultimately made by the FDA. \"Lexicon stock tumbles after FDA AdCom votes against Zynquista again\" was originally created and published by Pharmaceutical Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Long-standing pillars of strength are showing cracks. Tech earnings, a key catalyst for upside this year, have turned spotty, zapping a month’s worth of stock gains and sending the Nasdaq 100 to its first weekly loss in eight. A historic stretch of lockstep gains in equities and bonds just skidded to a halt amid ubiquitous event risks that include a deadlocked presidential election and big questions about what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates. From stocks and Treasuries to currencies and commodities, rarely has anxiety been as pronounced at this point of the cycle. In one example, a gauge of cross-asset risk kept by Bank of America Corp. just jumped to the highest point of any pre-election week outside of the financial crisis. Altogether it sets the stage for high drama for risk assets in a year that — until recently — was taking its place among the best in decades. Buttressed by solid earnings, the S&P 500 has been up as much as 23% in 2024, while measures of credit risk held near multi-year lows and Bitcoin surged 65%. “We have taken advantage of the rise in equity prices over the last several weeks to derisk portfolios,” said Jim Caron, chief investment officer of the portfolio solutions group at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “We believe there will be volatility around the elections and prefer to wait for the noise to die down and allow for the signal to reemerge.” October’s declines halted a run of concerted gains in shares and fixed income that was the longest since at least 2007, going by the major exchange-traded funds. While Friday’s rebound pared a weekly decline for the S&P 500, risk appetite broadly receded ahead of a high-stakes week. Tuesday’s presidential vote has brought the issue of fiscal policy to the fore while the Fed on Thursday will test the resolve of bond bears, who recently trimmed wagers on fast monetary easing. Trepidation is creeping up in hedging instruments. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, saw its nine-day version — one now covering a timeframe that includes the election and Fed meeting — almost double in two weeks for the biggest increase since 2022. A similar measure for Treasuries, the ICE BofA MOVE Index, reached a one-year high while gauges rose for investment-grade bonds and currencies.                    ",

Tech megacaps, which bore the brunt of the recent selling, led gains on Friday. Amazon.com Inc. surged 6.2% after strong results. Intel Corp. rallied 7.8% on a bullish outlook. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. beat profit, output and sales estimates. Boeing Co. rose 3.5% on optimism that a lengthy strike is nearing an end. Apple Inc. fell 1.2% after a tepid forecast. Wall Street tried not to read too much into data showing US hiring advanced at the slowest pace since 2020 in October while the unemployment rate remained low. The numbers were distorted by severe hurricanes and a major strike. The jobs report is the last major data point before next week’s Federal Reserve meeting and the Nov. 5 presidential election. “We’re in the midst of a hectic stretch with economic data, earnings, the Fed, and the US election,” said Bret Kenwell at eToro. “There’s been some additional volatility around these events, but so far nothing has changed the big-picture view. Until that changes, the long-term drivers of the bull market remain intact.” In fact, the S&P 500 rally of roughly 20% in 2024 through the end of October was the strongest in a presidential election year since 1936, according to Bespoke Investment Group strategists. Historically, gains of that magnitude in such a span have been followed by stronger-than-normal finishes to the year, they said. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, trimming this week’s losses.

Here is a list of bellwether counties Reuters compiled, based on research by UBS, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Beacon Policy Advisors in Washington and Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball with the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. The list, which is not exhaustive, includes the most pivotal counties in the seven battleground \"swing\" states that will determine the winner. ARIZONA Arizona's Maricopa County, home to 4.5 million people -- over half of the state's population -- is seen as one of the most pivotal battlegrounds across the United States, both for the presidency and the Senate. Biden in 2020 was the first Democrat to win the county since President Harry Truman in 1948, according to Beacon, and a strong performance by Harris would bode extremely well for her in the swing state. Polls there close at 9 p.m. ET (0100 GMT), but the state does not begin reporting results until one hour after all precincts have reported. Election officials have warned it could take up to 13 days to tabulate all the ballots in Maricopa, according to local media reports. In 2020, the Associated Press and Fox News called the state for Biden hours after polls closed, but other outlets waited nine days to declare him the winner. FLORIDA With Trump holding a near double-digit lead over Harris in Florida polls, the Sunshine State is not a battleground. But politicos will be watching Miami-Dade County, the state's most populous, which is also expected to report results relatively early after polls close there at 7 p.m. ET. The county was solidly Democrat from the 2008 election cycle through to 2016, when Hillary Clinton won it by 30 points, but by 2020 Biden only had a seven-point edge. As such, it's seen as a critical county for Harris. Further erosion of support for the Vice President in the Miami area, particularly among Hispanic voters, could spell broader trouble for her, according to Beacon. Goldman Sachs analysts noted that the U.S. dollar reacted strongly to that weaker Democratic Miami-Dade result in 2020, as investors raised their bets on a potential Trump win. GEORGIA Georgia's DeKalb and Gwinnett counties are also seen as bellwethers for Democrats' performance in the state. Biden built strong margins in the two urban counties, helping him narrowly win the swing state in 2020.                       ",

Over the five-day period, the stock has fallen about 20% despite a double-digit surge to kick off the week. Shares reversed course by Wednesday, suffering their largest percent decline after plunging around 22%. Since Tuesday, more than $4 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows. The oscillating of shares between highs and lows will likely continue as the election nears. One investor has warned that if Trump loses the election next week, shares of DJT could plunge to $0. \"It's a binary bet on the election,\" Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts show on Monday. Tuttle, who currently owns put options on the stock, said the trajectory of shares hinges on \"a buy the rumor, sell the fact\" trading strategy. \"I would imagine that the day after him winning, you'd see this come down,\" he surmised. \"If he loses, I think it goes to zero.\" Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock \"life of its own.\" \"It was volatile on the way up and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction,\" he said in a call with Yahoo Finance earlier this week. Prior to this week's sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen as both domestic and overseas betting markets shift in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showing Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. The betting markets have tightened in recent days. And national polls show both candidates in a virtually deadlocked race. Polls in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which are likely to decide the fate of the election, also show razor-thin margins. In September, the stock traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had also been under pressure as previous polling in September saw Harris with a bigger lead on the former president.         ",

        "body": "By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - A double dose of potentially market-moving events arrives in the coming week as Americans vote on their next president and the Federal Reserve offers more insight on the path of interest rates at its monetary policy meeting. The Nov. 5 vote culminates an election cycle that has captivated the country and sparked swings in corners of financial markets. Among these has been the waxing and waning of the so-called Trump trade, a bevy of asset price moves reflecting sentiment that Republican Donald Trump is gaining momentum in his race against Democrat Kamala Harris for the U.S. presidency. Those trades have included a rise in the U.S. dollar and a sell-off in Treasuries possibly fueled by strong economic data and a bitcoin surge spurred by hopes that Trump would deregulate the crypto industry. Still, polls remain deadlocked and bets leaning toward Trump were narrowing at the end of the week. Some investors expect volatility to accompany next week's vote, no matter the result. \"In either scenario, it seems like there's some near-term risk,\" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. Todd said a win by the Republican could be a \"sell the news\" event that sparks profit-taking in Trump trades. A win by Harris could spark a more serious unwind, he said. Control of Congress will also be determined with Tuesday's vote, adding another wrinkle for investors as they weigh how various political outcomes could impact assets over the longer term, with the two candidates offering starkly different paths for the U.S. economy. For example, the expectation that Trump would seek to lower regulations stands to benefit banks, while higher tariffs could benefit domestically focused small-cap companies while ramping up the potential for volatility in broader markets. Expectations that Harris would be more supportive of clean energy initiatives means solar and other renewable energy stocks could rise in the event she prevails, analysts said. Investors are also wary of volatility from an election result that is not immediately clear due to the closeness of the race or is contested by one of the parties. In 2020, Trump tried to overturn the results of his loss to President Joe Biden, falsely claiming it was the result of voter fraud in multiple states. \"The market did fine under Trump. It can do fine under Harris,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth. \"We just need clarity.\" FED AHEAD Thursday's Fed decision on monetary policy looms as another risk for the S&P 500's rally of some 20% this year, though mixed earnings from several tech giants this week led the index to end October in the red, following five straight months of gains.

Hurricanes and the ongoing Boeing strike contributed to the lightest print since December 2020. Interest rates fell. Tech earnings showed mixed results, with Amazon stock up and Apple down. US stocks jumped on Friday after the October jobs report missed economist estimates, opening the door for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The US economy added 12,000 jobs in October, well short of economist estimates of 106,000, representing the lowest job gains since December 2020. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.1%. The weak jobs report reinforced the case for more interest rate cuts from the Fed. \"The Fed will likely cut rates in the remaining two meetings as economic conditions weakened,\" LPL chief economist Jeffrey Roach said. The jobs report's weakness was driven by disruptions from hurricanes Helene and Milton, which battered Florida and North Carolina last month. The ongoing strike of about 30,000 Boeing union members also weighed on the report. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Friday: S&P 500: 5,739.46, up 0.59% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 41,955.92, up 0.46% (+192.46 points) Nasdaq composite: 18,208.88, up 0.63% Interest rates fell immediately following the weak data, with the 10-year US Treasury yield dropping to a low of 4.229% before rebounding slightly. The fact that the jobs report missed estimates but did not include a rise in the unemployment rate was encouraging, according to Bryon Anderson of Laffer Tengler Investments. \"The unemployment rate not increasing again is a good sign for the economy and breaks the Sahm rule everyone was panicking about a couple months ago. Hourly earnings increases are still increasing at a healthy pace so we still have confidence in the economy,\" Anderson, Investors were also digesting earnings results from mega-cap tech giants Amazon and Apple. Both companies beat analyst estimates, with Amazon stock surging about 7%. Meanwhile, Apple stock was down after earnings as weakness in its China business weighed on sentiment, with the stock dropping about 2%. Here's what else is going on: Carvana stock has soared more than 7,000% since it narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2022. The US economy is in for a double shock if Trump is elected president, Paul Krugman said. Wealthy sports fans can now put money into investments tied to their favorite leagues.

        "body": "Weary Boeing (BA) investors are getting a lift on Friday after the planemaker and its main worker union, the International Association of Machinists (IAM), struck a tentative deal. Under the proposal, Boeing upped its pay hike to 38% over the course of the four-year contract, up from the last offer’s 30% raise; merged the prior $7,000 ratification bonus with a $5,000 lump sum payment for a total $12K into 401(k) plans or as a cash payout; increased its 401(K) match; and lowered health care premiums, among other things. Boeing stock is up nearly 4% in midday trade as traders and investors bet the new offer will seal the deal. “It is time for our Members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,” the IAM said to its 30,000 union members. “We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success.” Boeing’s only statement with regards to the sweetened offer: “We encourage all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, Nov. 4.” Interestingly, Boeing committed to building its next airplane in the Seattle/Puget Sound region, where IAM is located, suggesting union members will assemble it. Boeing has a non-union plant in South Carolina, where some 787 Dreamliners are built. For Boeing, the resolution of this labor strike is tantamount. Last week, the company reported negative operating cash flow of $1.34 billion and a staggering third quarter net loss of $6.17 billion, bringing total losses in 2024 to nearly $8 billion. Boeing said negative operating cash flow reflected lower commercial plane deliveries as well as the impact of the work stoppage. Prior to the labor strike, Boeing was under heavy scrutiny to improve its safety culture following the Alaska Airlines door blowout in January, which was limiting the number of 737 MAX aircraft it could produce. Boeing’s dwindling cash position threatened the company’s investment credit rating, which led to the company announcing earlier this week that it would launch a $19 billion share sale to boost its cash reserves. The financial impact of the ongoing labor strike, entering its sixth week, has been costly for Boeing, the industry, and its union workers. The Anderson Economic Group estimates union members lost $808.3 million in wages, with Boeing suppliers losing over $2.3 billion. With Anderson estimating losses for Boeing at nearly $5.6 billion, the research firm projects overall direct losses for all parties involved, and the Seattle Metro area, at $9.66 billion.

        "body": "(Reuters) - Intel (INTC) will lose its spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after a 25-year run to Nvidia (NVDA), S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday, the latest blow to the struggling chipmaker that was among the first two technology firms to be included in the blue-chip index. Once the dominant force in chipmaking, Intel has in recent years ceded its manufacturing edge to rival TSMC and missed out on the generative artificial intelligence boom after missteps including passing on an investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Intel's shares have declined 54% this year, making it the worst performer on the index and leaving it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. The stock fell about 1% in extended trading on Friday, while Nvidia was up 1.5%. Launched in 1968, the Silicon Valley pioneer sold memory chips before switching to processors that helped launch the personal computer industry. In the 1990s, \"Intel Inside\" stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. Nvidia has emerged as a cornerstone of the global semiconductor industry, thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI technologies which has driven a seven-fold surge in its shares over the past two years. The company's shares have risen more than two-fold this year alone. Once popular only among gamers who hunted for PCs with Nvidia's graphics processors, the company is now the second-most valuable in the world and is seen as a barometer for the AI market. The company's 10-for-one stock split that took effect in June also helped pave the way for its addition to the index, making its soaring shares more accessible to retail traders.

The company said on Thursday that it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecast $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said operating income is expected to be between $16 billion and $20 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall Street had projected $17.49 billion. In the third quarter, Amazon posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon's closely tracked Amazon Web Services unit tallied revenue of $27.45 billion in the quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street's projections. \"You've got the ingredients you needed for the stock to go up,\" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance. Sundaram pointed to Amazon's 11% operating margin, which came in above Wall Street's expectations of 9.34%, as another key driver of the stock's move higher after hours. Arun noted that Amazon is able to pull on other levers in its business, like its e-commerce unit or advertising, to help grow margins while it spends on AI. Amazon's earnings follow a volatile few trading sessions for Big Tech companies amid other earnings reports as artificial intelligence spending and how each company is managing it has been in particular focus. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines and posted impressive gains in its cloud and advertising segments, business lines that compete with Amazon. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Meta (META) had a tougher going. The stocks of both tech giants fell after their earnings Thursday, as investors were spooked by an increase in AI spending, despite both companies beating expectations after the bell on Wednesday. Meta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth in 2025. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend \"more than that\" in 2025. In 2023, Amazon's capital expenditures were $48.4 billion. Jassy said the increased spending is driven by generative AI, which he described as a \"maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity.\" \"The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware,\" Jassy said on the earnings call when explaining why spending continues to grow. \"And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all that up front, in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources.\"     ",

On Thursday, ConocoPhillips reported an adjusted EPS of $1.78, beating estimates; revenue of $13.6 billion vs. $14 billion expected. The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 34% to $0.78/share. The company raised the outlook for FY24 production to 1.94-1.95 MMBOED (from 1.93 to 1.94 MMBOED). Truist Securities analyst Neal Dingmann expects pro forma FCF to rise substantially due to strong organic performance and additional cash flow from Marathon Oil. The analyst reiterated the Buy rating and $138 price target on COP. With stable prices, ConocoPhillips could potentially repurchase nearly all shares issued to MRO within 6-7 quarters, assuming the dividend remains steady and debt repayment is deprioritized, given the company’s strong balance sheet, adds the analyst. The analyst says that ConocoPhillips’ FCF is anticipated to be driven by a balanced portfolio, including Lower 48 activities, LNG projects, and Alaskan operations. Dingmann revised EBITDAX estimates to $24.988 billion (from $24.719 billion) vs. consensus of $24.443 billion for 2024 and $33.208 billion (from $33.745 billion) vs. estimate of $27.939 billion for 2025. Scotiabank analyst Paul Y.Cheng expects ConocoPhillips’ (Sector Perform, $115 price target) third-quarter 2024 results to positively influence its near-term share price performance.

While Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all topped analyst expectations for sales and profits last week, the results weren’t strong enough to justify their lofty multiples relative to the broader market. With few reasons to bid up the group, technology investors hit the sell button, resulting in a 1.8% drop in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index, with only Alphabet and Amazon ending the week in the green. The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, weighed down by the big-tech group. “Investors had higher numbers in mind,” said Michael Casper, equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They’re expecting more from AI and these AI projects than what they’ve gotten so far.” The issue isn’t the current quarter per se: the group of seven companies is on track to deliver profit growth of 30% in three-month period through September, which would beat the estimate of 18% at the start of earnings season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The trouble is next year’s profit outlook remains murky with the tech giants continuing to spend heavily on infrastructure to support more AI computing power. Analysts have been cutting their 2025 profit-growth projections for the Magnificent Seven cohort since earnings season began more than two weeks ago. Higher spending on artificial intelligence dominated Magnificent Seven earnings this season. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta pumped a record $59 billion into capital expenditures in the third quarter while pledging to spend significantly more next year. “Right now you have a little bit of Silicon Valley arrogance that says, we just are going to spend, because we know better than you do,” said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co. While there were signs that revenue from AI-related demand is picking up steam, the message from management teams was that investors will need to wait longer for the big payoffs to show up. Microsoft’s AI business is on track to exceed an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which would make it the fastest business in the company’s history to reach that milestone, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said on the earnings call.

        "body": "By Bart De Muynck The views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of FreightWaves or its affiliates. The narrative surrounding AI often focuses on its potential to automate jobs and replace human workers. However, in the realm of supply chains, a more nuanced reality is emerging: one where AI and human talent are not adversaries, but partners in a symbiotic dance. While AI undoubtedly brings automation and efficiency to supply chain operations, human expertise remains indispensable. As Gartner aptly points out, “access to labor continues to be a top constraint in supply chains.” This highlights the critical need to attract, retain and empower talent in this increasingly complex landscape. Rather than replacing humans, AI can make supply chain roles more desirable. By automating mundane and repetitive tasks, AI frees up human workers to focus on higher-value activities that require critical thinking, problem-solving and creativity. This not only enhances job satisfaction but makes these roles more appealing to a digitally savvy workforce. Retail, a sector already leading in AI adoption, is well positioned to leverage this advantage in the war for talent. By offering roles that combine technology and human expertise, retailers can attract and retain skilled professionals who are eager to work at the forefront of innovation. The true power of AI in supply chains lies in its ability to augment human intelligence, not replace it. AI-powered tools can provide valuable insights, predictions and recommendations, empowering supply chain leaders and their teams to make better, faster and more informed decisions. Think of ChatGPT in the freight industry. It can assist with tasks like providing real-time information by answering questions about shipment status, tracking information and potential delays. It can help generate reports and summaries by compiling data and creating reports on key performance indicators. It can further facilitate communication and collaboration by translating documents, summarizing complex information, assisting with customer inquiries and sharing that information with multiple stakeholders. While these capabilities are valuable, human oversight remains crucial. Complex situations, ethical considerations and critical judgment still require human intervention. AI, in this context, acts as a powerful assistant, enhancing human capabilities and enabling more efficient and effective decision-making.            ",

Employers created just 12,000 jobs for the month, way below the average of 194,000 for the prior 12 months. But employment will almost certainly rebound in the November count. Beyond that, the weak October number still continues a remarkable string of job gains under President Biden, just days before voters will pass judgment on the economic record Biden and his vice president, Kamala Harris, have racked up. Job growth has been positive every single month since Biden took office in January 2021. Donald Trump didn’t accomplish that during his one presidential term, from 2017 to 2021. Barack Obama did preside over an unbroken string of monthly job growth during his second term, from 2013 to 2017. But that was part of the wan recovery from the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, a rebound many Americans found painfully slow. Before that, no president enjoyed a perfect record on monthly job growth, going back to 1939. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton each came close in their second terms, reflecting the booming economies of the mid-1980s and late 1990s. But Reagan had one spoiler month when employment declined, while Clinton had three. Biden still has three more months in office, so his perfect record isn’t complete. But there’s no reason to expect a late-game miss. The economy is growing, consumers are spending, and Federal Reserve interest rate cuts now provide a modest tailwind. More important than Biden’s standing in the history books is the credit voters give Biden, and by extension Harris, for prosperity in real time. And it’s pretty obvious ordinary Americans are unimpressed. Biden’s approval rating is a dismal 39%, more or less where it has been for the last two years. Biden’s approval sank as inflation crept up to its 9% peak in 2022. Inflation got a lot better, but Biden's approval ratings didn't. The year-over-year rate of price hikes is now just 2.4%. Biden has gotten no benefit from that. Harris’s approval rating matters more, of course, since she replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate over the summer. Voters like Harris better than Biden. Her approval rating is around 48%. An incumbent running for reelection would prefer an approval rating above 50%, but Harris is in the ballpark. Voters also view Harris differently than Biden on the economy, which is the top election issue, as usual. Luckily for Harris, voters rate her higher than Biden on the economy, suggesting they don’t blame Harris for the top economic problem of the last three years, inflation. Yet there’s also not much evidence voters give either Biden or Harris credit for the record job growth of the post-COVID years.           ",

        "body": "It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Realtors, mortgage brokers, and economists anticipated a busy fall homebuying season as inventory improved and buyers — buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s jumbo interest rate cut — came off the sidelines to take advantage of mortgage rates at a two-year low. But after a vanishingly brief honeymoon period, rates started rising. They’ve been up for five weeks straight and, in recent days, have trended north of 7%, a level that some market watchers say will keep potential buyers sidelined. Housing contract activity showed signs of life in September when mortgage rates were lower, but home sales this year are on track to hit a multi-decade low. A combination of factors has pushed up mortgage rates quickly. Treasury yields, which mortgage rates follow closely, have risen dramatically in recent weeks in the face of strong economic data and pre-election jitters. Economic uncertainty surrounding next week’s election may complicate their path back down. “This run-up in mortgage rates over the last couple of weeks has probably been very surprising for Fed officials,” said Chen Zhao, who leads Redfin’s economics research team. “I think it’s been surprising for everyone.” The Fed doesn’t directly control mortgage rates. Instead, rates move primarily based on expectations about the direction of interest rates in the future. Last month, a string of hot economic data on almost everything from consumer spending, inflation, wages, and hiring called into question how much further the Fed would need to ease interest rates to support the economy in the months ahead. In other words, all those positive signs for the economy are notches in the negative column for interest rates — including home loans — coming down. Read more: How the Federal Reserve rate decision affects mortgage rates At the same time, Treasury yields began a dramatic rise as traders began pricing in a possible election victory for former president Donald Trump, whose proposed policies of tariffs and tax cuts are seen as bad for bonds — tariffs are generally inflationary, which would require higher interest rates, while tax cuts would likely require the US to issue more debt. That can drive up interest rates if there isn’t more demand to meet the increased supply. Economic data released this week muddied the picture further. Treasury yields briefly fell on Friday morning in response to a lackluster jobs report, raising the possibility that mortgage rates would move downward in response. But the reaction was short-lived. By mid-morning, they were higher again.            ",

        "body": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan is planning to build an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka, dubbed a “conveyor belt road” by the government, to make up for a shortage of truck drivers. The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries. A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an “auto flow road,” in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s. “We need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,” said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said. “The key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,” Endo said. The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors. In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports. The boxes measure 180 centimeters in height, or nearly six feet, and are 110 centimeters, or 3.6 feet, by 110 centimeters in width and length, about the size of a big closet. The system, which is also intended for business deliveries, may be expanded to other routes if all goes well. Human drivers may still have to do last-mile deliveries to people's doors, although driverless technology may be used in the future. Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it’s known as the “2024 problem.” Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association.          ",

The Dallas-based company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Texas federal court. TGI Fridays Executive Chairman Rohit Manocha in a statement said the “primary driver of our financial challenges resulted from COVID-19 and our capital structure.” Sit-down chain restaurants have more broadly faced challenges in recent years as diners choose to get food delivered or visit upscale fast food chains like Chipotle and Shake Shack. A U.S. bankruptcy judge in September approved a reorganization plan for seafood chain Red Lobster after years of mounting losses and dwindling customers. Founded in 1965, the popularity of TGI Fridays peaked in 2008 with 601 restaurants in the U.S. and a $2 billion business, according to Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research at Technomic. Its sales in the U.S. were $728 million in 2023, down 15% from the prior year, according to Technomic. It now counts 163 restaurants in the U.S., down from 269 last year. It closed 36 in January and dozens more in the past week. TGI Fridays Inc. said it only owns and operates 39 restaurants in the U.S., which is just a fraction of the 461 TGI Friday-branded restaurants around the world. A separate entity, TGI Fridays Franchisor, owns the intellectual property and has franchised the brand to 56 independent owners in 41 countries. Those remain open. ",

The company is responding to a letter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sent it earlier this month. The agency may also pursue litigation, Capital One warned. At the center of the controversy is a lawsuit filed by some customers last year, who alleged that the company introduced a new \"360 Performance Savings\" account with a higher interest rate than it was paying to customers of another account, \"360 Savings.\" The customers claimed that this mismatch was not clearly communicated, resulting in them missing out on potential earnings. Capital One said it had a contractual right to change interest rates at its discretion and information about the new account was always available on its website. The company had filed a motion to dismiss the customers' lawsuit, a spokesperson told Reuters. CFPB declined to comment. The probe comes as the company is awaiting regulatory approvals for its $35.3 billion acquisition of Discover Financial Services, which could reshape the payments industry. Last week, New York Attorney General Letitia James said she was investigating if the deal violates the state's antitrust law. In July, Capital One said it will commit $265 billion over five years to lending, philanthropy and investment if its takeover goes through. The Wall Street Journal first reported the company's disclosure of the possible CFPB action on Friday. (Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber) ",

        "body": "FreightWaves SONAR State of Freight hosted a special edition of its monthly webinar Friday to discuss how the outcome of the U.S. presidential election could affect the commercial transportation industry. With only four days until voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, FreightWaves SONAR CEO Craig Fuller and Senior Analyst Tony Mulvey drilled down on the possible impact of each candidate’s policies on the freight market. Here are five takeaways from Friday’s discussion. Federal policies can significantly affect the freight industry in a number of ways, according to both Fuller and Mulvey. “If you think about the freight economy, it’s so big, it’s so massive, because about 32% of the U.S. economy is tied to logistics-dependent industries,” Fuller said. “It means that these businesses simply cannot exist without logistics, and so policy has an enormous amount of impact on freight.” Fuller cited policies that shape labor, taxes and tariffs on foreign goods as examples. “Things like labor policy, whether we’re talking about the port strike that was short-lived and could potentially happen in January, is one thing. Tax policy, which drives goods and manufacturing demand, consumer consumption, those things are actually really important. Tariffs are obviously really important,” Fuller said. While higher tariffs on imports could be a catalyst to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S., they also have the possibility of hurting companies and consumers, Mulvey said. “If it’s a blanket tariff, 10%, 20%, it does at some point eat into the company’s profit margins to some degree,” Mulvey said. “Companies are going to offset that by raising prices. I think overall, there is some risk to higher prices on certain goods.” If Trump is reelected, he has floated the idea of taxes on imports from all countries shipping goods into the U.S. and as much as a 60% tax on imports from China. How tariffs could affect the transportation industry and the U.S. economy has already been demonstrated in Trump’s first term, Fuller said. “If you look at what happened during the first Trump administration, we didn’t see rapid inflation,” he said. “There were tariffs put on China during the first administration. This is at a time when the global economy, and particularly the Chinese economy, was doing exceptionally well. Their economy is now at risk of actually contracting. There is a lot of excess capacity in the Chinese economy. So putting these tariffs in place probably means that those Chinese exporters have no choice but to lower the prices to be competitive. Because they don’t, they won’t be able to export anything, and the entire Chinese system is based on exports.”          ",

Members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the agreement to increase the capacity of the data center located on the site of Talen Energy's Susquehanna nuclear generating facility could raise power bills for the public and affect the grid's reliability. As Big Tech races to grow its data centers needed to expand technologies like generative artificial intelligence, locating centers directly on power plant sites has become an attractive option to power up quickly. \"Co-location arrangements of the type presented here present an array of complicated, nuanced and multifaceted issues, which collectively could have huge ramifications for both grid reliability and consumer costs,\" FERC Commissioner Mark Christie said in the order. The Talen agreement, however, would divert large amounts of power currently supplying the regional grid, which FERC said raised concerns about how that loss of supply would affect power bills and reliability. It was also unclear how transmission and distribution upgrades would be paid for. FERC Chairman Willie Phillips dissented from the vote, indicating that it could slow U.S. dominance in the global contest over artificial intelligence. \"It is a step backward for both electric reliability and national security,\" Phillips said.

It’s ideal for temperature-controlled food products. Lineage isn’t kidding when it says the warehouse is peak automation. The facility has automated cranes and rail-guided vehicles to store, move and retrieve products – not to mention the automated receiving process that speeds up unloading times while also improving accuracy. “Finding solutions to problems in the food supply chain by using innovation is at the heart of everything we do at Lineage,” said Sudarsan Thattai, chief information officer and chief transformation officer. “To us, innovation is not just a buzzword but a driving force behind our efforts to create a better and stronger supply chain. The new fully automated Hazleton facility marks another significant addition to our automated network, furthering our purpose of delivering food safely and reliably to millions of families around the globe.” Another week, another acquisition. This week Portabull Cold Storage acquired Portable Refrigeration Storage Inc. The companies both specialize in electric-powered temporary on-site cold storage units, and the acquisition welcomes Portabull to the Southeast.

A company spokesman declined to put a precise number on the firings, say which employees were let go or for what reasons. But the shakeup comes as Jimmy Donaldson, who draws millions of views under the MrBeast alias with highly produced stunts and giveaways, deals with accusations of impropriety against himself, his collaborators and others within his multimillion-dollar production company that have threatened his family-friendly image. Investigators only identified “several isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk. The nearly three-month probe concluded that there was no basis behind allegations that MrBeast team members committed sexual misconduct or “knowingly” employed people with “proclivities or histories towards illegal or questionable legal conduct.\" Spiro said the team interviewed 39 current and former employees. Millions of documents from phones, emails, and messaging platforms including Discord and Slack were also reviewed, according to the letter. The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July. Also circulated online by YouTuber Rosanna Pansino was a 2017 recording of Donaldson making racist comments and using homophobic slurs. A preliminary July shoot for his ambitious “Beast Games” Amazon Prime Video show was quickly hit with safety complaints from some contestants who said they faced “limited sustenance” and “insufficient medical staffing” while competing for a $5 million grand prize. MrBeast in turn has hired new executives, including a head of personnel and a general counsel, according to Spiro, and additional employees are getting “targeted training and executive coaching” for undisclosed violations of company policy. The company “has grown exceedingly quickly from a YouTube start-up comprised of a group of talented young individuals to a much larger entity,” Spiro wrote to MrBeast's Board of Directors. “It is not uncommon that policies and practices essential in a mature company would lag behind commercial success.”        ",

Sara Bowen, Boeing’s vice president leading the DEI department, also announced her resignation from the company on LinkedIn Thursday. “Today I turn in my blue badge,” Bowen said in her LinkedIn post. “It has been the privilege of my lifetime to lead Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion at the Boeing company these past 5+ years. Our team strived every day to support the evolving brilliance and creativity of our workforce. The team achieved so much – sometimes imperfectly, never easily – and dreamed of doing much more still. All of it has been worth it.”  The DEI department is the latest staffing cuts within the company as 17,000 jobs are reportedly on the chopping block for layoffs by early next year. AirlineGeeks has reached out to Boeing for comment. The move comes as striking members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) are scheduled to vote on a new contract offer Monday. Over 33,000 IAM members have been on strike at Boeing locations in Washington, Oregon and California since Sept. 13. According to a news release from IAM, the new contract proposal would deliver a 38% wage increase over four years and a $12,000 ratification bonus. It would also reinstate Boeing’s Aerospace Machinists Performance Program (AMPP) incentive plan with a guaranteed minimum annual payout of 4% for both 2024 and February 2025.  Additionally, the contract includes a 401(k) employer match of 100% up to 8%, a special company retirement contribution of 4% into 401(k) and a $105 pension multiplier per year for those vested in the pension plan. The union rejected a previous contract from Boeing after putting it to a vote last week, though sentiment may now be growing toward accepting the newest offer. IAM District 751 posted an endorsement of the newest offer on X/Twitter, calling for members to approve the new contract. “Your Union is endorsing and recommending the latest IAM/Boeing Contract Proposal,” IAM District 751 posted. “It is time for our Members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory.

Popa is now a tax supervisor at Matthews, Carter & Boyce P.C., a firm based in Fairfax, Va. The seasonal gig was the perfect tryout for Popa, 61. “I worked for a couple months and got to suss them out a little bit, and they got to check me out. It was a good fit.” Since September, however, US employers have announced plans to hire 659,850 seasonal workers, the highest total since 2021 when 967,300 seasonal opportunities were tallied, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “The economy and job market seem to be chugging along and seasonal employers are optimistic for a strong holiday,” Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told Yahoo Finance. That’s despite the US labor market adding far fewer jobs than expected in October — just 12,000 payrolls vs. the 100,000 expected by economists. But retailers, in particular, appear to be ramping up for a strong spending season, according to the Challenger report. Target announced the company would hire 100,000 workers for the holidays in their stores and fulfillment centers. Others ramping up seasonal hires include Aldi, Amazon, Bath & Body Works, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and UPS. “Seasonal jobs are great opportunities for job seekers who want to eliminate gaps in their resumes or build new skills,\" Challenger said. “Often, these seasonal positions become permanent. Particularly for teens, college students, and older workers, seasonal positions are ideal to get into the labor market.” Historically, postings for seasonal workers start ramping up in September and peak in November. During busy times of the year, particularly the holiday shopping season, jobs surge to meet a temporary boost in demand. Getting hired quickly becomes less complicated. While you might think of these seasonal jobs as just short-term gigs, they actually offer some great benefits. Not the biggies, of course, such as health insurance or a 401(k) retirement plan, but certainly a foot in the door — which could lead to a permanent gig that does include those benefits. Popa had taken a three-year sabbatical when she took the temporary accounting position.

That’s in part because Latin America’s biggest economy is the world’s second-largest producer of ethanol, which can be used to produce SAF. Agriculture powerhouse Brazil has an abundance of cheap crops to make biofuels, providing the nation a leg up on competitors including the US. Many of Brazil’s supplies also rank better in terms of carbon emissions, key to meeting requirements for SAF production. “Brazil is in a very privileged position to be the world’s SAF hub,” said Bruno Serapião, chief executive officer of sugar cane group Atvos Agroindustrial SA. The Mubadala-backed company is currently considering investing in an SAF unit that will use the alcohol-to-jet technology, converting ethanol into aviation fuel. SAF is one of the few pathways the aviation industry has at its disposal to curb its carbon footprint, which accounts for about 2.5% of global emissions. Interest in green jet fuel is picking up, driven by policy support, particularly in the European Union and the US, but demand far exceeds available supply and is forecast to continue growing. Ricardo Mussa, chief executive officer of sugar and ethanol company Raizen SA, said Brazil’s ethanol production puts it in a strong position to be a major exporter of SAF. “For every liter of SAF, we need 1.7 liters of ethanol, so the best place to produce would be in the origin, in Brazil,” Mussa said at Bloomberg New Economy at B20 in Sao Paulo last week. Production of green aviation fuel in Brazil has the potential to reach around 50 billion liters (13.2 billion gallons) by 2030 with further investments in agriculture, according to preliminary data from a study carried out by Airbus, LATAM Airlines Group SA and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That’s similar to the US’s potential output, but Brazil is set to be a bigger exporter, with American production being consumed domestically.                     ",

        "body": "The quarterly results this week of Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) provided an AI-era playbook for making investors patiently wait for results on massive infrastructure spending. Alphabet dazzled Wall Street on Tuesday with earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong growth in its cloud business. The company posted profit and sales increases of 37% and 15%, respectively, compared to the year prior. Even as investors in recent months have expressed some impatience with the tech industry's enormous investments in AI technology, Google showed that a dominant performance of its core business can alleviate those concerns. Amazon, too, offered a resounding earnings beat. The company posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. The stellar report helped offset lingering concerns about mounting capital expenditures. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call Thursday that \"as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space.\" Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and Jassy said the company plans to spend \"more than that\" in 2025. The e-commerce giant's approach to selling AI spending was also helped by claims that new revenue has already arrived. While Amazon has not disclosed exact figures for AI-related sales, Jassy has said the AI business inside of its cloud unit has generated several billion dollars. And on Thursday he added that the business is growing at a \"triple-digit year-over-year percentage.” But investors have not given all the big-spending tech companies the same leeway when it comes to ballooning capital expenditures. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) were met with a more unforgiving investor response this week, even as both tech giants beat Wall Street’s expectations on earnings and revenue. Investors sent both stocks lower after their respective reports. Wall Street recoiled after executives of both companies said they expect capex to continue increasing in the quarters to come. Meta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth next year and revised its expectation upward for 2024 capex. The uneasiness among investors harkens back to Facebook's prior spending spree, when Reality Labs lost more than $13 billion and shares in the company tanked 60% in 2022. Zuckerberg has since improved the company's financials and its standing on Wall Street, but he's also prompted a fresh round of jitters.        ",

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround They feared her numbers weren’t large enough to meaningfully improve public services in time for the next general election due in 2029. While traders reacted to £142 billion ($184 billion) of extra borrowing over the course of the parliament to fund investment projects, as well as a £40 billion tax rise and underwhelming economic growth projections, Labour ministers and aides were looking past the government’s initial splurge in day-to-day spending to what happens in the years before Britons next go to the polls. Public spending is due to rise by an average 2% in real terms starting this year, but it is front-loaded before tailing off significantly from 2026. Departments with unprotected budgets, such as transport or justice, are heading for real-terms cuts later in the parliament, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank. That is tantamount to austerity, one party official said privately. Such complaints underscore the tightrope Reeves was walking as she tried to navigate markets — still primed from the memory of the meltdown under Liz Truss two years ago — and a governing Labour Party determined to rebuild Britain’s ailing public services which still bear the scars of the austerity years that defined the Conservative administration after the financial crisis. Reeves’ budget, one party official said, would mean spending constraints in areas of importance to voters, from bus and rail services to flood defenses and even Home Office efforts to cut crime. Having been elected on a “change” platform and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s promise of a decade of national renewal, some Labour politicians wondered about winning a second term. Speaking to Bloomberg on Thursday, Reeves defended her budget and said her priority is “economic and fiscal stability.” She denied that her spending plans would mean a return to austerity, and said her aim was to “wipe the slate clean” after inheriting what she called a fiscal black hole from the Tories. By Friday, the sharp bond selloff — which never approached the scale of the Truss-era turmoil — had abated, leaving the yield on benchmark 10-year gilts about 20 basis points higher than five days ago. Still, the market reaction was far from ideal given Starmer and Reeves sold Labour as a force for stability after years of political and economic turmoil under the Conservatives.

After reaching the $30 million threshold, World Liberty will terminate the US offering, even though the company has some $288.5 million of tokens available for sale, according to the document. Zachary Folkman, a World Liberty co-founder, said during a September interview streamed on Elon Musk’s X that the company would sell some tokens through an exemption to the stringent US requirements for companies raising capital. The exemption, known as Regulation S, is only available for tokens sold to non-US investors. World Liberty representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment. Most token issuances are done offshore because the industry has been subject to heavy scrutiny in the US, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has sought to regulate these assets as securities. In addition, trading in tokens is usually much more robust offshore, another reason that companies such as World Liberty prefer to market their offerings to non-US investors. World Liberty Financial is being promoted by Trump and his sons as part of the decentralized finance movement, democratizing access to financial services. The filing lists Trump and two of his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, while adding a caveat that says “this person is included for informational purposes and does not reflect a determination” that they are officially promoting the offering itself. Folkman and Chase Herro, another World Liberty co-founder, are listed as its executive officers in the filing. They also run a company called Axiom Management that is located in Dorado, Puerto Rico, which offers big breaks from US taxes to people who set up businesses there. The token sale started soon after Trump launched his fourth collection of nonfungible tokens, which are digital depictions of himself. The former president headlined the world’s largest Bitcoin conference this summer in an effort to appeal to crypto voters and donors.                ",

The video is an example of targeted disinformation, according to the statement from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Berkshire once again cut its holdings in Apple Inc., the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said Saturday in a statement. Its stake in the iPhone maker was valued at $69.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $84.2 billion in the second quarter, indicating that Berkshire cut its stake by about 25%. Berkshire first disclosed its Apple stake in 2016 and had spent $31.1 billion for the 908 million Apple shares it held through the end of 2021. Buffett said in May that Apple would likely remain Berkshire’s top holding, indicating that tax issues had motivated the sale. “I don’t mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position,” he said at the annual shareholder meeting. “I don’t think Warren Buffett’s ever really been super comfortable with technology,” said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. Cathy Seifert, a research analyst at CFRA, said Berkshire’s Apple stake was “starting to become an outsized percentage” of its overall portfolio. “I think it made sense to sort of lighten that exposure a little bit,” she said. Net Seller Berkshire reported $34.6 billion of net share sales in the three months through September. The company has struggled to find ways to deploy its cash pile, as Buffett has found market prices too high to find attractive deals. At the annual meeting, Buffett said Berkshire wasn’t in a rush to spend “unless we think we’re doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money.” Higher yields on cash holdings set “the bar a little bit higher for other opportunities,” Shanahan said. Interest and other investment income has more than doubled at the conglomerate’s insurance business, reaching $3.5 billion in the three months through September. Buffett, 94, has used some of the cash hoard to repurchase some of its own stock, though even that had become costlier recently. Shares of Berkshire have gained 25% this year, boosting its market value to $974.3 billion. Its market capitalization eclipsed $1 trillion for the first time on Aug. 28.                ",

Musk’s plans center on what he has called end-to-end artificial intelligence. The plan is to deluge Tesla’s AI systems with video footage from existing Teslas, in the expectation that algorithms running on huge supercomputers will learn how to drive safely. He hopes this will make it possible for Tesla to deliver fully self-driving cars faster and more cheaply than his competitors. Existing Tesla owners would get access next year, and new specially designed robotaxis would be ready in 2026. Older Workers Can Now Supersize Their 401(k) Savings The Trump-Betting Whale Speaks Out: ‘I Have Absolutely No Political Agenda’ You Bought Blockbuster I Bonds. Here’s What to Do With Them Now. Nvidia to Replace Intel in Dow Jones Industrial Average. Sherwin-Williams Also Joins. Financial Guru, TV Star, Bestselling Author? Not So Fast The breakthrough AI of Musk’s dreams contrasts starkly with the approach of other companies pursuing autonomous vehicles. Waymo is the industry leader, already operates commercial robotaxis and just announced a $5.6 billion round of financing. Waymo, which is owned by Google-parent company Alphabet, also uses lots of AI, but its approach is to break down the problem of self driving into more distinct tasks with more input from human engineers. Waymo is using data from more sensors, including lasers and radar, which gives the company’s cars a much richer view of the world. In the simplest possible terms, Musk’s vision for Tesla is about an AI system that learns by watching people drive. Waymo and others are teaching their vehicles by correcting them as they do the driving themselves. Musk’s bet hinges on the current state of AI technology reaching a level of sophistication that it hasn’t yet achieved and may not for some time, AI developers say. One of Musk’s defining characteristics has been an ability to start with a goal in mind, and work backward to the solution required. With self-driving tech, his goal is a system affordable enough to put on most any vehicle. Musk has said robots and self-driving cars could propel Tesla’s market value to at least $30 trillion. Supporters of his plans point to successes his companies have achieved by drawing outside the lines, like the radical reduction in launch costs achieved at SpaceX, which now dominates the rocket business. Musk has a long history of overpromising and being vague about how exactly his ideas become reality. He uses names for Tesla’s driver-assistance technology—“Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving”—that imply more capability than it has, and Tesla has missed all prior targets for the release of fully autonomous driving systems.

Outgo believes it has found a way to use these transformational technologies to make lives easier for carriers: That’s by fixing factoring. “Discussions about AI and trucking focus too much on the impact for large enterprises – for example a cost-cutting initiative at a big shipper,” said Marcus Womack, CEO of Outgo. “We looked at it differently: What if AI and automation could radically improve the financial side of running a trucking business? The first step is reinventing factoring to be faster, a better value for truckers and more tailored to their financial needs.” Outgo believes that traditional factoring has failed to deliver for carriers. Factoring has relied on outdated processes and technology to get truckers paid. Today’s factoring companies continue to run hundreds of manual processes, from confirming loads by calling brokerages one by one to reviewing documents by hand. This is time-consuming and expensive, while creating numerous opportunities for human error. That harms carriers in two ways. First, elevated cost structures at these companies keep rates high. “From our analysis, approximately 40% of factoring revenues among the large factoring companies is spent on operational costs.” Womack said. “But it’s carriers that actually pay the price.” Second, these manual processes take time, which slows down payments. This is a recipe for disaster for small carriers and owner-operators, who tend to operate with tight margins and rely on timely funding. Fortunately, these costly manual processes are prime candidates for AI and automation, and Outgo is seizing the opportunity to simplify payments for carriers. Over the past years, the company has steadily driven down the cost of factoring by deploying technology and products into every step of the invoice life cycle. But why should this matter to carriers? Because Outgo is dedicated to passing along the benefits of technology to its customers. Today the company is a market leader with its transparent, low rates, but also offers all carriers a way to lower their rate even further to 1% when they use the Outgo card. Outgo has also demonstrated its leadership on funding speed and recently announced the fastest funding speeds in the industry. The company guarantees four-hour funding at no extra charge, but 50% of the time customers have cash ready to spend in just 90 minutes.This speed is possible precisely because Outgo has removed manual processes wherever possible.

Global benchmark Brent rose 0.4% to settle near $73. Oil notched a 3.2% decline for the week, which followed Israel’s limited attack on Iran over the weekend, a move that reduced some traders’ expectations that the conflict could threaten the region’s energy infrastructure. But after a steep drop on Monday, some analysts warned that the market had “relaxed too quickly,” and futures regained some of the lost ground in recent days. Oil options markets also provided signs that traders are once again pricing in large premiums for bullish call contracts. The report from Axios on Thursday, which cited two Israeli sources it didn’t identify, said Iran is planning a strike on Israel through militias that it backs in Iraq, with the assault expected to be carried out using drones and ballistic missiles. While the report initially caused a spike in futures prices, the advance faded as traders questioned likelihood and extent of a possible flare-up in the conflict. Israel and Iran are in a “quasi-choreographed dance of trying to project toughness without provoking an all-out war, but nonetheless, the day-to-day headlines surrounding the Middle East have been a big deal,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc. Also limiting crude’s gains were US economic data that showed the nation added fewer jobs than expected last month, though the figures were distorted by storms and labor disputes. Developments in the Middle East this week had been pointing to a potential easing of hostilities, with Israel also considering a US-led proposal to end the conflict in Lebanon. Still, the Israeli military said the nation would hit back “very hard” should Iran attack again. The oil market has a number of key events on the horizon, including the US election, a meeting of China’s top legislative body next week and a looming decision from OPEC+ on whether to start gradually reviving production starting in December. Macquarie analysts said in a note that market participants are underestimating US production, which hit a new record in August.          ",

Verizon said in September it would buy Frontier at an offer price of $38.50 per share, as the U.S. telecom giant looks to build its fiber subscriber base and better compete with rivals such as AT&T. The takeover, however, has faced opposition from some Frontier shareholders. Reuters first reported last month that some of the fiber-optic internet provider's largest shareholders were concerned about the deal. Glendon Capital Management, which owns nearly 10% of Frontier, said last month it had decided to vote against the deal at the current price, as it \"significantly undervalues\" Frontier's assets and earnings trajectory. ISS said the firm finds it unlikely that Verizon would \"dramatically raise its bid for Frontier at this stage.\" Last week, Frontier urged its shareholders to vote for the proposal, saying that it had reviewed interest from other potential buyers and found Verizon's proposal as the most favorable option. The offer was \"highly attractive\" and creates significant value for stockholders, it had then said. (Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel) ",

        "body": "The buzziest place to get hearing aids? It’s Costco. The big-box chain known for bulk spaghetti and paper towels has generated a cultlike following among hearing-aid wearers. Affordable prices, a generous return policy and good customer service have spread by word-of-mouth, making Costco the country’s largest dispenser of hearing aids behind the Department of Veterans Affairs. Older Workers Can Now Supersize Their 401(k) Savings The Trump-Betting Whale Speaks Out: ‘I Have Absolutely No Political Agenda’ You Bought Blockbuster I Bonds. Here’s What to Do With Them Now. Financial Guru, TV Star, Bestselling Author? Not So Fast Nvidia to Replace Intel in Dow Jones Industrial Average. Sherwin-Williams Also Joins. Hearing-loss awareness has increased in recent years because of the availability of over-the-counter hearing aids and Apple’s AirPods Pro 2, which can be turned into hearing aids. But instead of buying OTC aids or seeing an audiologist at a clinic or hospital, legions of Costco devotees swear by the retailer, which has been offering hearing aids since 1989. Although the retailer employs some audiologists, people who visit usually see a licensed hearing-aid specialist. And Costco isn’t staffed to address ear-related medical problems such as wax buildup or balance issues. Cathy Ellis first tried hearing aids over 20 years ago, a $6,000 pair she got from an audiologist. Maintenance was difficult and costly so she stopped using them. About four years ago, at the recommendation of her uncle, she decided to go to Costco. She was worried she’d face pressure sales tactics. “I had my snake-oil radar up,” says Ellis, age 67, who lives in Aldie, Va. When the hearing-aid specialist told her she had too much ear wax to conduct an accurate hearing test, Ellis was impressed the specialist didn’t just do the test anyway. After a doctor cleaned her ears, she returned to Costco for the test. She ended up with a $3,000 hearing-aid pair that syncs with her iPhone. “There’s no stigma and no upselling,” says Ellis, who hasn’t had any issues with her hearing aids. She has since recommended Costco to a neighbor. The idea of inexpensive hearing aids with high-level customer service began when Sol Price, known as the father of warehouse retail stores, visited an audiologist in the San Diego area. When he saw how much hearing aids cost, he decided his Price Club stores—which later merged with Costco—could sell them for less, says Paul DiCola, assistant vice president of Costco’s hearing-aid business.

        "body": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than $325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions. Berkshire said it sold off about 100 million more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The remaining stake of roughly 300 million shares was valued at $69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth $174.3 billion. Investors will also be disappointed to learn that Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own shares in the quarter. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said shareholders will wonder why Buffett is continuing to accumulate so much cash. “Are they more pessimistic about the future economic and market picture than perhaps others are?” she said. Buffett said at the annual meeting in May that part of why he started selling some of his Apple shares is that he expects tax rates to go higher in the future. But Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he wonders if part of the reason Buffett started selling Apple is tied to last year's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger because the sales started shortly after Munger's death. Shanahan said Buffett has never been as comfortable with technology businesses as his longtime partner was. “If Charlie Munger were still alive, perhaps he wouldn’t have sold down the position quite as aggressively — maybe at all,” Shanahan said. Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to $26.25 billion, or $18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealized paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of $12.77 billion, or $8,824 per Class A share. Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire’s operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire’s bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything. By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's $10.8 billion, or $7,437.15 per Class A share.        ",

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) — Basel Adra, a Palestinian, and Yuval Abraham, an Israeli, spent five years making a movie that depicts daily life in Adra’s village under Israeli occupation. The resulting film, “No Other Land,” has been hailed as one of the year's most powerful documentaries, winning prizes at international film festivals. It’s also stoked controversy, prompted death threats for its makers and — despite the acclaim — remains without an American distributor. Opening this week in France and next week in the United Kingdom, the feature-length documentary has already sold in many international territories. Its status as an Academy Awards contender remains intact — after hosting it during the New York Film Festival, the Lincoln Center will screen the film for a one-week, Oscar-qualifying run beginning Friday. But the filmmakers believe the monthslong inability to find a U.S. distributor boils down to political reasons, with Election Day in the presidential contest between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump looming. “Maybe they’re afraid to be defunded if Trump wins,” says Abraham, speaking in an interview from Paris alongside Adra. “But Basel risked his life for years since he was a young boy to film this material. That requires a lot of courage. Can we not have one distributor with the courage, OK, to take a certain risk, but to distribute such an acclaimed and such an important documentary?” “No Other Land” began long before the current chapter of the war in Gaza. It’s told largely from the perspective of Adra, who was born in Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in the occupied West Bank. The area, a rugged mountainous region south of Hebron, has for decades been a site of protest against the Israeli government, which ordered Palestinians off the land to make room for a military training ground. In 1980, the Israeli military declared Masafer Yatta a closed “firing zone.\" Israeli authorities said the residents — Arab Bedouin who practice a traditional form of agriculture and animal herding and have lived on the land since before 1967 — only used the area part of the year and had no permanent structures there at the time. Adra was born into this; his father was an activist on behalf of the community and Adra was 5 when his mother first took him to a demonstration. Following a 2022 court decision, the army set up checkpoints and regularly demolished community structures — including a school. A camera, Adra says, “became the only tool beside our steadfastness.” He captured the regular demolitions of homes, the violent encounters with Israeli settlers and the ongoing effect the struggle has had on the villagers.

        "body": "A majority of American workers report being satisfied with their jobs, but the cost of living and higher pay are still top concerns, according to a survey conducted in collaboration with Echelon Insights for the Economic Innovation Group (EIG). The survey, which included 1,516 respondents and was conducted from Sept. 6-11, found that if the average American worker could change one thing about their current job, it would overwhelmingly be more pay (55%). If they could change one thing about the economy, it would be the overall cost of living (45%). “Workers are overwhelmingly satisfied with their careers, with their job security, even with the amount of money that they're earning at this stage of their career,” Economic Innovation Group CEO John Lettieri told Yahoo Finance. “But they're deeply unhappy about the rising costs of goods and services and housing that they need, and they're not very confident in the labor market itself as a place where they can go find another equivalently good job if they had to.” The EIG survey found that 71% of workers are either somewhat satisfied or very satisfied with their current job, while just 15% reported being dissatisfied. According to Lettieri, the findings show “real consistency there that goes back many decades.” “When you look at other long-running surveys that have gone back 30, 40 years, American workers very consistently report a high level of satisfaction with their jobs,” he said. “It's somewhat counterintuitive … that workers are so consistently happy. So ... I’m not very surprised that we see workers are happy right now.” The quits rate is at its lowest level since 2020, with 3.1 million Americans voluntarily leaving their jobs in September. In October, the unemployment rate stood at 4.1%. Lettieri described the current state of the economy as “worker-friendly,” largely due to rising wages and low unemployment. “I think they have a good reason to feel pretty solid about their current circumstances, that the pain of the pandemic is largely behind us even if it caused a major disruption while it was at its peak,” he said, “but that just brings us to this longer historical arc where workers tend to say they’re satisfied with their jobs, even in relatively weak economies.” Still, higher pay is a top priority for these workers. Overall, wages have outpaced inflation since the start of the pandemic. These stats vary, though, when broken down by factors like household size or monthly budgets. “You hear so much about access to childcare, better healthcare, better benefits,” Lettieri said. “Are these other things where they’re feeling the most friction, or if they could change something, would it just come down to pay? And the answer is really clear: Overwhelmingly, workers rank their top choice as ‘just pay me more.’ So this is like the Jerry Maguire finding here: ‘Just show me the money.’”           ",

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround A judge ruled late Friday that former chief executive officer Parag Agrawal and other high-ranking officers can proceed with claims that Musk terminated them right as he was closing the deal to cheat them out of severance pay before they could submit resignation letters. In the complaint the ex-executives filed in March, they cited a passage in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk in which the billionaire is quoted telling the author as he rushed to complete the acquisition there was a “200-million differential in the cookie jar between closing tonight and doing it tomorrow morning.” Musk has been fighting legal claims for back pay by thousands of Twitter staff he laid off when he acquired the social media company for $44 billion two years ago and rebranded it as X Corp. At least one former employee was awarded unpaid severance in September in a closed-door arbitration that could set a precedent for other similar cases, the worker’s lawyer told Bloomberg News. In July, Musk and X Corp. defeated a lawsuit alleging that at least $500 million in severance pay was owed to about 6,000 laid-off employees under provisions of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act. US District Judge Maxine Chesney on Friday rejected arguments by Musk’s lawyers that Agrawal’s claims should be dismissed. Agrawal was joined in the lawsuit by Vijaya Gadde, who was Twitter’s top legal and policy official; Ned Segal, the chief financial officer; and Sean Edgett, the company’s general counsel. They allege they’re owed severance benefits equal to one year’s salary plus unvested stock awards valued at the acquisition price. Chesney is overseeing two other suits brought by Twitter executives, including one by Nicholas Caldwell, who was general manager for “core tech” and is seeking $20 million as compensation for lost severance. The judge on Friday denied Musk’s request to dismiss a claim by Caldwell that mirrors Agrawal’s allegations. Representatives of X didn’t respond outside regular business hours to a request for comment. The case is Agrawal v. Musk, 24-cv-01304, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).         ",

Fitch Ratings gave all the tranches investment-grade designations, noting the high credit scores of the customers receiving the financing.

This isn’t Tesla’s first foray into solar asset-backed securities. In 2016, the company acquired SolarCity which led bond sales in that arena. Since 2018, however, the collateral Tesla offers on asset-backed debt has been largely limited to leases on its vehicles. Then last year, it debuted its first bond supported by prime auto loans. So far in 2024, the company issued $2 billion of asset-backed debt, compared to nearly $4 billion last year. Its latest issuance comes at a time companies of all stripes are diving into debt markets. Sales in the broader universe of asset-backed securities hit $321 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, hitting their highest level since the financial crisis. In particular, debt backed by solar-related collateral jumped to $5 billion so far in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. That’s compared to $3.7 billion around the same time last year. At the same time, delinquencies on solar loans have climbed to the highest this year since the early pandemic, according to data from Kroll Bond Rating Agency. The US solar industry has also been pressured by high interest rates, which have made solar equipment less affordable to homeowners. That has pushed solar firms like Lumio and SunPower Corp. to bankruptcy in recent months.

Harris spoke before heading to campaign rallies in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina. Trump was attending two rallies in North Carolina and one in Salem, Virginia, a state that isn't a battleground, after his late-night rally in Milwaukee. “We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,” Trump said in remarks released by his campaign before his first event, in Gastonia, North Carolina. President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race this summer when it became clear he could not win, was doing his part for the Democrats, making one last 2024 campaign stop in Scranton, Pennsylvania. With the end of the race in sight on Tuesday, a reporter in Milwaukee referred to Harris as “Madam President,\" leading the vice president to caution, “three days.” Johnson, R-La., later walked back his comments about cutting semiconductor subsidies, indicating he only meant that Republicans would “streamline” the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. But Harris said Johnson had only issued the follow-up statement because “their agenda is not popular.” The legislation has pumped billions of dollars into producing computer chips in the United States, supporting union jobs in battleground states such as Michigan.

        "body": "WASHINGTON — Three major provisions of a rule aimed at protecting trucking companies against unpaid claims from brokers will have to be pushed back a year due to a delay getting a new online registration system up and running. The rule, “Broker and Freight Forwarder Financial Responsibility,” which took effect in January, contained five provisions: Two had a compliance deadline set for Jan. 16, 2026, and three had a compliance deadline of Jan. 16, 2025. But because the new registration system is not expected to be available before Jan. 16, 2025, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will need to extend the compliance date for the three early provisions to meet the Jan. 16., 2026 compliance date instead “to provide regulated entities time to begin using and familiarizing themselves with the system before compliance is required,” according to a notice posted by FMCSA on Friday. The new registration system is expected to be ready sometime in 2025. “This action is being proposed because FMCSA has determined that only its forthcoming online registration system will be used to accept filings and track notifications, and this functionality will not be added to its legacy systems,” the notice states. FMCSA has given the public 15 days to comment on the change. The compliance deadlines pushed back by this extension are: Immediate suspension of broker/freight forwarder operating authority. When a broker or freight forwarder’s available financial security falls below $75,000, FMCSA will suspend its operating authority registration. Surety or trust responsibilities in cases of broker/freight forwarder financial failure or insolvency. If a surety/trustee becomes aware that a broker or freight forwarder is experiencing financial failure or insolvency, it must notify FMCSA and initiate cancellation of the financial responsibility. Enforcement authority and penalties for financial responsibility providers who do not comply with the regulations. After notice and an opportunity for a hearing, surety companies or financial institutions who violate the regulation will be ineligible to provide financial responsibility for three years and may be subject to a civil penalty. The two 2026 provisions, which pertain to broker/freight forwarder trust funds, are not affected by the compliance date change. While the regulation provides protections for motor carriers, brokers and freight forwarders also benefit from the rule. The Transportation Intermediaries Association petitioned FMCSA 10 years ago for some of the changes as a way to address rampant freight fraud throughout trucking and freight brokerage.       ",

And while this has happened, something else is going on at the other end of the spectrum. In what appears to be a classic barbell-shaped pattern, risk tolerance is both getting more sensible and more risky at the same time. Options trading is reaching fresh highs for popularity — and it’s playing a greater financial role at brokerages like Robinhood. The company, which just published its quarterly results this week, saw trading volume surge, and with it came a significant jump in options revenue. As you can see from our Chart of the Week, it’s up to $202 million for the third quarter — and it’s pulled away from the revenue from stock trading. Robinhood’s innovative free trading transformed the brokerage industry, making the no-cost transactions ubiquitous. And with the key barrier to making moves gone, price-sensitive retail investors piled in, likely aided by stimulus checks. As trading grew significantly, investors also explored derivatives and margin. “Retail participation in options market trading rose sharply during the pandemic, peaking at 48% in July 2022. While it has bounced around since then, it hit 45% in July 2023,” wrote NYSE’s director of research, Steven W. Poser, late last year. “This data suggests that substantial retail options trading is here for the foreseeable future.” At the same time, Robinhood continuously beat the drum that it was a place for set-and-forget index fund investors, which was also true. There’s evidence that its retail investors also helped stabilize the market during the 2020 pandemic crash by buying the S&P 500’s dip. These two things, however, are very different. While the S&P 500 is composed of volatile stocks that are subject to big fluctuations that require risk tolerance, there’s no debate that throwing your lot in with them is an investment. If there are wounds, time will almost certainly heal them. But options trading, though traditionally used to hedge risk, is an easy way to speculate and place high-risk, high-payout bets. And as is the case with certain types of leveraged investing, the downside can be infinite. As Merrill Lynch’s website notes, “If you write an uncovered call, you face unlimited potential loss, since there is no cap on how high a stock price can rise.”      ",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that Republicans “probably will” try to repeal legislation that spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips, a statement he quickly tried to walk back by saying he would like to instead “streamline” it. Johnson made the initial comment while campaigning for a vulnerable New York GOP congressman in a district that is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant. A reporter asked Johnson whether he would try to repeal the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had disparaged last week. “I expect that we probably will, but we haven’t developed that part of the agenda yet,\" Johnson replied. Democrats quickly jumped on the Republican speaker’s comments, warning that it showed how Johnson and Trump are pursuing an aggressive conservative agenda bent on dismantling even popular government programs. The White House has credited the CHIPS Act for spurring hundreds of billions of dollars of investments as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs. Vice President Kamala Harris has pointed to the legislation on the campaign trail as proof that Democrats can be entrusted with the U.S. economy. Johnson, who voted against the legislation, later said in a statement that the CHIPS Act, which poured $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry, “is not on the agenda for repeal.\" “To the contrary, there could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill—to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements,” the speaker's statement said. It wasn't the first recent comment Johnson has had to walk back. Earlier this week he had to clean up comments he made saying he wanted to “take a blow torch to the regulatory state” and make “massive” changes to the Affordable Care Act. After facing political blowback, he said that repealing the health care law was “not on the table.” The incident was emblematic of Johnson's struggle working closely with Trump and at the same time campaigning for his House colleagues, especially those locked in tough reelection battles that are crucial to Republicans holding a narrow majority. The speaker was campaigning for Rep. Brandon Williams, a New York Republican who worked in the tech industry before running for Congress and supported the CHIPS Act. Williams said in a statement that he spoke privately with Johnson after he suggested that the act could be repealed. “He apologized profusely, saying he misheard the question,” Williams said.

Roundtable anchor Rob Nelson spoke with Peter Saddington, GP at StaaS.Fund, on the major trends he’s seeing in the intersection of Web3 and AI and where he believes the most disruptive opportunities lie. Reflecting on his firm’s investments, Saddington noted, “We deployed capital into AI and Web3 applications in 2023, six of them specifically. That’s a big chunk of our portfolio, which holds about 22 companies.” He highlighted how these applications integrate decentralization with AI to address longstanding industry challenges, adding, “You don’t have to go far to find niche, bleeding-edge companies thinking about how to include decentralization with AI or improve content management in a censorship-resistant way.” Saddington sees growing demand for alternative platforms that offer more control to creators, especially in light of increasing censorship on traditional Web2 platforms. Just this week, billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos sparked a firestorm by stepping into block the newspaper's presidential endorsement. The move led to the Post losing 10% of its subscribers after readers called out the apparent censorship and bias at the newspaper. “The best mechanisms are those replacing the current platforms we have in Web2. More entities are becoming censored, but we’re finding a huge economic opportunity for influencers, creators, and businesses,” Saddington observed, noting a broader shift towards platforms catering to politically conservative communities. He emphasized that opportunities in the AI and blockchain space continue to grow, particularly as creators seek platforms that prioritize user ownership and autonomy. “It’s an economic market opportunity. The ‘red wave’ is upon us,” Saddington explained, referencing the emergence of platforms like Truth Social. “You don’t have to go far to find ideas at the intersection of AI and blockchain that are tapping into this movement.” ",

        "body": "With billions of dollars processed every day, cross-border trade payments have become increasingly complex. Companies must navigate a range of banks, clearinghouses and payment processors, all of which assess fees and contribute to potential delays. Traditionally, cross-border payments are slow, opaque and costly, causing cash flow problems for businesses. For instance, intermediary banks involved in transactions each add fees and processing time, making total transaction costs less transparent for trading companies. As trade expands, fraud risks grow as well. Higher volumes of cross-border transactions mean payment systems are more susceptible to fraud, especially in high-risk regions. For instance, the Asia-Pacific region reports some of the highest fraud rates, with online payment fraud losses expected to exceed $200 billion by 2024. In Latin America, fraud costs companies up to 19% of annual revenue, underscoring the critical need for fraud detection investments in these regions. A 2023 report from The Global Treasurer highlights efforts by financial leaders like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan to address these inefficiencies. They are developing API-driven solutions that enable businesses to monitor payments in real time, reduce costs and streamline international payment processes. A notable example is the recent collaboration between digital trade finance platform ODeX and global carrier Hapag-Lloyd, which partnered with PayPal to offer a transparent payment service. “The integration of PayPal into ODeX delivers unparalleled convenience and security to Hapag-Lloyd customers,” Binai Thoppil, co-founder and chief commercial officer of ODeX, said in an email to FreightWaves. “By allowing payments without the need for login credentials and offering the cheapest card payment rates in the industry, customers can now experience a faster and more cost-effective transaction process.” ODeX provides automated invoicing, real-time updates, payment tracking and transparency. Its digital payment options and reduced credit card fees alleviate cash flow issues, accelerating payment cycles. Since their 2023 partnership, Hapag-Lloyd has rolled out ODeX solutions across Asia, the Middle East, Africa and, more recently, the United States. Thoppil told FreightWaves that partnerships with integrated solutions like these are crucial for fraud prevention on a global scale. Fraud in global trade finance is exacerbated by digitalization, with common tactics including business email compromise (BEC), phishing and invoice manipulation.              ",

That is, all the companies that would have been affected by the latest attempt at regulatory overreach: SB 1047.

Except that was all disinformation promulgated by Andreessen Horowitz and the other moneyed interests that might actually have been affected as backers of billion-dollar enterprises. In fact, small models and startups would have been only trivially affected because the proposed law specifically protected them. It's odd that the very type of purposeful cutout for \"Little Tech\" that Horowitz and Andreessen routinely champion was distorted and minimized by the lobbying campaign they and others ran against SB 1047. (The architect of that bill, California State Senator Scott Wiener, talked about this whole thing recently at Disrupt.) That bill had its problems, but its opposition vastly overstated the cost of compliance and failed to meaningfully support claims that it would chill or burden startups. It's part of the established playbook that Big Tech — which Andreessen and Horowitz are closely aligned with, despite their posturing — runs at the state level where it can win (as with SB 1047), meanwhile asking for federal solutions that it knows will never come, or which will have no teeth due to partisan bickering and congressional ineptitude on technical issues. This newly posted joint statement about \"policy opportunity\" is the latter part of the play: After torpedoing SB 1047, they can say they only did so with an eye to supporting a federal policy.

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Goldschmid helped run King Street’s hedge fund and drawdown vehicles, which focus on credit, and plans to start his own firm, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He had been a partner at King Street since 2011 and was also a member of its management committee. King Street had been charting a revival path for its key credit businesses after a period in which its hedge-fund assets fell by half and clients bolted. Since then, it has been expanding its offerings, including attracting fresh capital for its drawdown funds that focused on illiquid credit and longer lockups. The money across its hedge funds and illiquid strategies makes up about $15 billion of its total assets under management. The firm confirmed that Goldschmid will leave at year-end and said it was grateful for his contributions. “Paul expressed interest for some time in doing something entrepreneurial,” a firm spokesperson said in an email. Goldschmid was named co-portfolio manager of the hedge-fund assets after the departure of one of its founders, Fran Biondi, was announced in 2019. Biondi and Brian Higgins founded King Street in 1995 with $4 million after they worked together for almost a decade at First Boston. The firm’s hedge fund assets still amount to less than what it had amassed almost a decade ago, when they totaled $20 billion. The firm then went through a period of poor returns, especially as credit markets climbed, while it averaged cash holdings of about 40% — frustrating investors who were unhappy with the low-single-digit returns. Since July 2020, when Higgins took over as sole managing partner, the hedge fund has returned an annualized 8.8%, according to a person familiar with the firm’s performance. Its cash balance, on average, has been zero. Its newest drawdown fund, which started in May 2022, has a net internal rate of return of 15.1%. Last year, Goldschmid had warned that companies were about to get hit by a dangerous combination of too much debt and too little cash flow, a scenario that could present new opportunities for distressed-credit investors. “There’s a huge math problem in credit right now,” Goldschmid said at the time.

Both Thames Water and KKR declined to comment. Thames Water, which serves about 16 million people in and around London, is at the centre of a crisis over sewage dumping, crumbling pipe networks and huge debts. The utility, Britain's biggest water supplier, said in October it had lined up a financing lifeline of up to 3 billion pounds with some of its creditors in a deal which if approved will help it survive for another year at least. KKR is among a small number of investors studying Thames Water's finances with a view to supporting a rescue share sale, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. KKR's decision hinges on a final determination by water regulator Ofwat which is due by January at the latest, according to the report. It was unclear which of KKR's funds was participating in the Thames Water equity-raise, Sky News added. However, one obstacle to KKR buying a big stake in Thames Water may be its 25% holding in Northumbrian Water, the report said. Under Ofwat's mergers regime, the Competition and Markets Authority would need to review the deal, although there would not be an automatic prohibition, Sky News said. The British government has been on standby to place Thames Water into a special administration regime given the risk of a financial collapse.

One company, though, has thrived amid the various changes: Netflix (NFLX). The streaming platform beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs. The stock is up more than 50% since the start of the year. Compared to other players, Netflix's subscriber count and profitability stand out. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. \"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Other analysts have piled onto that thinking, declaring the infamous streaming wars officially over. \"Netflix won the streaming wars,\" MoffettNathanson, one of the leading equity research firms for the tech and media sector, said in a note penned by analyst Robert Fishman last week. \"The media space right now is defined by a dichotomy in which Netflix stands as a lone exception.\" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed, recently telling Yahoo Finance's Market Domination that the company has \"undoubtedly\" secured its No. 1 position. The \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and, most importantly, subscribers. The goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.                            ",

        "body": "AGUA CLARA, Brazil (AP) — A historic agreement that's helped curb deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon for nearly two decades suffered a major blow after Mato Grosso, the country´s largest soybean-producing state, passed a law ending incentives for participating processing and trade companies. The law passed last week was designed to void the Soy Moratorium — a 2006 deal in reaction to a Greenpeace investigation that linked soy produced in illegally deforested areas to U.S. commodities giants Cargill, Bunge and ADM. Under pressure, the companies agreed at the time not to buy soy produced in areas cleared after 2006. The date was later revised to July 2008. Several studies in recent years have shown the moratorium contributed to the Amazon’s preservation. A 2020 study in the journal Nature Food found that the agreement, in combination with public policies, contributed to the steepest reduction of deforestation recorded in Brazil’s Amazon, between 2003 and 2016. Backed by soybean producers and most of Mato Grosso´s lawmakers and mayors, the new legislation cuts tax benefits to companies that participate in any agreement that imposes restrictions on expanding agricultural activities into areas that can be legally deforested. Governor Mauro Mendes signed the law Oct. 24. It goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2025, but regulations are pending. It states that only the illegally deforested area of a farm will be prevented from selling soy. In other words, if a 4,000-acre (1,618-hectare) property clears 200 acres (81 hectares) unlawfully, just the output from that specific area is blocked. Specialists warn that such refined monitoring is technically challenging, if not unfeasible. Under the moratorium, property with any post-2008 deforestation is forbidden altogether to sell its crops, regardless of whether the deforestation is legal. Supporters of the new state law have long claimed the moratorium´s 2008 limit is stricter than Brazilian legislation that allows the deforestation of up to 20% of a large rural property in the Amazon. “We will not rest as long as the moratorium harms even one producer,\" the Mato Grosso soy producers president Lucas Costa Beber said in a celebratory statement. \"And until this agreement is extinct, the trading companies will not have a peaceful sleep.\" Environmental nonprofits and the entity representing leading soybean trade and processing companies have criticized Mato Grosso´s initiative. “The law is a setback,” said Bernardo Pires, sustainability director of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove), which supports the moratorium. “Companies committed to sustainability should receive twice as many benefits instead of losing them.”          ",

According to the company’s third-quarter earnings report for 2024, it lost 294,000 cable customers during the quarter. This contributed to Spectrum facing a 6.7% year-over-year decline in video revenue, compared to the same time period last year. Related: Spectrum makes a desperate move to win back fleeing customers Spectrum is also continuing to face a decline in internet customers. In the report, the company revealed that it lost 110,000 internet customers during the quarter, however, its internet revenue managed to increase by almost 2% year-over-year. This comes after many Spectrum customers have complained about facing multiple price increases for internet services. In the report, Spectrum attributed the decline in internet customers to the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which was discontinued in February. The ACP was a government-sponsored program Spectrum offered to provide eligible households a discount of up to $30 a month for internet service. As the loss in both internet and video customers continues to hurt the company’s pockets, it is heavily relying on a new strategy to win back its customers. With streaming services becoming increasingly popular amongst consumers, Spectrum has decided to embrace the trend. The company announced that by early next year, it will offer its TV Select customers streaming subscriptions that are worth up to $80 per month at no extra cost. The streaming apps those customers will have access to include; Disney+, Max, Peacock Premium, ESPN+, BET+, Discovery+, Paramount+, AMC+ and ViX. Related: Spectrum customers show company the consequences of hiked prices Bringing customers back will be accomplished through a four-part plan Charter CEO Christopher Winfrey laid out during a recent earnings call.

Management said customer retention remains strong, but it is seeing lower pallet counts per stop as the industrial economy remains soft. Tonnage per day declined y/y by 12.5% in July, 9.9% in August and 12.2% in September. Tonnage was down 9% y/y in October but flat with September. October had a tough y/y comparison to October 2023, which benefited from a cyberattack at competitor Estes. The y/y tonnage declines peaked at 22% in May (down 20.4% on a two-year comparison). Declines are expected to ease as the fourth quarter progresses, largely due to easier comps. Tonnage was down 9.6% y/y last November followed by an 8.3% decline in December. ArcBest’s prior-year tonnage comps are easier than those of many of its peers. It began swapping out transactional freight with better-yielding freight from core contractual customers around the time Yellow Corp. (OTC: YELLQ) closed. The process dragged down tonnage as the change in freight mix resulted in lower shipment weights. The 7.4% increase in the yield calculation during the quarter was driven by the decline in shipment weight. Netting out the change in weight resulted in a roughly 3% decline to yield. Yield was down 3% y/y in October (flat excluding fuel surcharges) and down 3% from September (with and without fuel). Management called out a tough monthly comp to last year (up 8.1%) and a less favorable mix profile as the reasons for the weaker yield result. It said nothing structural has changed around price negotiations, which continue to be “rational” across the industry.                   ",

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Willie Phillips, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said artificial intelligence and related technologies hold “generational significance” and belong in the US. “We have that opportunity today with regard to data centers, and we should not surrender it,” Phillips said Friday at a highly anticipated FERC technical conference about building data centers next to power plants. “Data centers moving overseas due to a lack of power supply and infrastructure or regulatory barriers could cause lost opportunities for economic growth and raise national security concerns for our nation.” Friday’s meeting launches the first big discussion at FERC about how to serve data centers, which are poised to drive unprecedented growth in electricity demand. AI is evolving quickly, and the data centers being planned to support it use as much power as entire towns. But building new power plants and transmission lines takes years, and US grids are already under increasing stress from aging infrastructure, the rise of renewable resources and extreme storms. The conference focused on the merits and pitfalls of building data centers next to power plants, often described as “co-location.” In March, Amazon Web Services paid Talen Energy Corp. $650 million for a data center campus adjacent to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. FERC is currently reviewing a complaint from utilities that the deal could lead to higher rates for their customers. Critics fear co-location will strain electricity supplies on the power grid and allow deep-pocketed tech giants to avoid paying for infrastructure upgrades, shunting those costs onto consumers. FERC Commissioner Mark Christie pointed to the threat of shortages by 2030 on the largest US grid — operated by PJM Interconnection — which covers such data center hot spots as Virginia and Ohio. “We want to serve data centers, absolutely, but we want to be fair to all the other consumers,” Christie said. But co-location would allow companies such as Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to open data centers at a faster pace. Executives from power generators Talen, Vistra Corp. and Constellation Energy Corp. told the conference that data centers can support existing plants and bring on new electricity supplies, noting Microsoft’s recent deal to revive the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Dominion Energy Inc., said its Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut could conceivably be an option for co-location in the future, according to a statement filed to FERC.          ",

Things were looking better on Oct. 29, however, when the company posted better-than-expected third-quarter results. FREDERIC J.

In September, Snap rolled out Simple Snapchat, a streamlined version of the app that declutters the home screen, removes the Snap Map and Stories tabs, and consolidates its navigation bar around three icons.

As part of Snap’s push for augmented reality, Spiegel said, the company launched the fifth generation of Spectacles, its AR glasses powered by Snap OS, and introduced a series of generative AI innovations for its AR developer platform. The company reported adjusted earnings of 8 cents per share, up from 2 cents a year earlier and beating the consensus estimate of 5 cents a share.

This week, Goldman Sachs analysts predicted gold will rise about 10% to $3,000 by December 2025 due to physical gold demand from central banks, investors pouring into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by physical gold, and speculative positioning. \"History suggests that gold positioning tends to rise with uncertainty and when investors seek safe havens,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' Lina Thomas and Daan Struyven. Retail investors wanting to get in on the precious metals action have several options, from owning physical gold to investing in mining companies. Here are some: \"For gold, as well as silver, buying the physical asset is the safest and most reliable way,\" said Alex Ebkarian, co-founder and COO of Allegiance Gold. Ebkarian said investors should have a mid- to long-term outlook for their return on investment, as well as understand there are storage and transportation fees if the gold is stored outside the home such as at a secure depository. There is also an upfront premium cost paid during acquisition. \"When it comes to investing in bars, I suggest starting at the 1 oz with well-known brands such as PAMP Suisse, Valcambi,\" he said. Physical purchases can be made from local dealers, online platforms, and even big box retailer Costco (COST), though the latter doesn't purchase any back from customers. Buying coins also carries a premium — from the most common ones to the rarest collectibles. \"When it comes to coins, it is best to focus on products from the world’s top four sovereign mints: US Mint, the Royal Canadian Mint, the Perth Mint, and the Royal Mint. They produce investment-grade coins that are highly sought after and extremely liquid. Diversifying your holdings provides you more flexibility and options in the future,\" said Ebkarian. The most popular for both gold and silver is the 1 oz. American Eagle. \"American Eagle 1 oz. coins are the most liquid, traded, and recognized bullion coins in the world. Those are in great demand,” said Scott Travers, executive editor of COINage Magazine and author of the Coin Collector's Survival Manual. Travers said consumers should make sure coins are verified through one of the industry's main three grading agencies or buy a tester to verify them.              ",

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround The US oil majors’ increases were fueled by pumping record amounts of crude from the Permian Basin, which continues to surprise analysts with year-over-year growth and efficiency gains. Exxon’s oil and gas production, boosted by the $60 billion acquisition Pioneer Natural Resources Co., increased 24% from a year earlier while Chevron grew output by 7%. The US companies weren’t alone. Shell Plc and BP Plc hiked production 4% and 2% respectively, even despite net zero targets that are more aggressive than their American rivals. It all combines to a weakening outlook for oil prices, which have already dropped roughly 12% in the past six months due to lackluster demand from China, the world’s biggest importer of crude. They may drop even further if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries follows through with its plan to bring back previously curtailed production. The moment also stands in stark contrast to just a few years ago, when executives were working to rein in capital spending during the pandemic and as they faced pressure from the environmental, social and governance movement to invest in low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels. Success in the former and failure at the latter has led the industry to coalesce around a common strategy: oil and gas that’s cheap enough to withstand any energy transition scenario. “Exxon and Chevron are sticking to their core oil and gas strategy while getting bigger in some of the best assets globally,” said Nick Hummel, a St. Louis-based analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co. “The near-term outlook for oil and gas feels soft, especially with OPEC poised to move more barrels onto the market.” Exxon, which lost an activist battle to ESG-leaning Engine No. 1 in 2021, is the prime example of the change in strategy. Acquisitions, divestments, cost cutting and efficiency gains have “doubled” the oil giant’s profit margins per barrel since 2019, even at constant oil prices, Chief Financial Officer Kathy Mikells said in an interview. And meanwhile, Chevron is pumping 27% more oil and gas than a decade ago despite cutting capital expenditure in half. Much of that is because the company was spending heavily on Australian gas projects that are now operational, but it’s also down to efficiency gains and a pivot toward the Permian. Chevron has doubled its production in the basin in the last five years and is now returning records amounts of cash to shareholders.              ",

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround The company will replace rival Intel Corp. in the 128-year-old Dow Jones Industrial Average prior to the start of trading on Nov. 8, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement late Friday. Sherwin-Williams Co. is also joining, replacing Dow Inc. The addition of Nvidia to the blue-chip index is a testament to the power of the AI-driven rally that’s pushed the chipmaker up 900% in the past 24 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only major US equity benchmark that didn’t hold Nvidia — until now. “Nvidia is a well-run company and joining the Dow demonstrates just how powerful its rally has been in recent years after it was at the right place at the right time when no one else was,” said Scott Colyer, chief executive at Advisors Asset Management. The Santa Clara, California-based company has been the poster child of the euphoria surrounding AI and the biggest driver of stock market gains. The chipmaker ended the week with a market value of $3.32 trillion, about $50 billion shy of Apple Inc. Shares were up 3.2% in post-market trading, putting Nvidia in a position to dethrone Apple as the world’s most valuable company as soon as Monday if the gains hold. Intel joined the gauge in November 1999 when it was added along with Microsoft Corp., SBC Communications and Home Depot Inc. Once the industry leader in computer processors, Intel has been recently struggling under a turnaround plan. The company has slashed spending in 2024, cut jobs and suspended investor payouts. Shares have lost 54% this year, and sank another 2% after the bell. “Intel has lagged in a huge way,” said Adam Sarhan, founder of 50 Park Investments. “Now, the Dow is evolving. You don’t want to see stocks that were there 30 years ago. You want to see what’s the strongest that survive today.” Midland, Michigan-based Dow Inc. has been in the blue-chip index since 2019, when it was spun off by former parent DowDuPont. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which first started as an index of 12 industrial stocks that included General Electric Co., has faced criticism for being a much narrower equities gauge than the S&P 500 Index or the Nasdaq 100 and lacking technology stocks that have dominated markets in recent years.

        "body": "By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) -Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway extended their retreat from stocks in the third quarter, further slashing their holdings in Apple and boosting cash to a record $325.2 billion. In its quarterly report on Saturday, Berkshire said it sold about 100 million, or 25%, of its Apple shares over the summer, ending with about 300 million. Berkshire has now sold more than 600 million of the iPhone maker's shares in 2024, though Apple remained its largest stock holding, at $69.9 billion. It sold $36.1 billion of stock overall, including several billion dollars of Bank of America shares, and bought just $1.5 billion, making the quarter the eighth straight where Berkshire was a net seller of stocks. Berkshire did not repurchase any of its own stock, the first time that happened since the second quarter of 2018, suggesting that Buffett does not even view shares of his $975 billion conglomerate as a bargain. Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research in New York, said the cash buildup could be a warning sign. \"Berkshire is a microcosm of the broader economy,\" Seifert said. \"Its hoarding cash suggests a 'risk-off' mindset, and investors may worry what it means for the economy and markets.\" Berkshire also reported a 6% decline in quarterly operating profit to $10.09 billion, falling short of analyst estimates, largely from insurance underwriting losses including Hurricane Helene, and currency losses from a strengthening U.S. dollar. These offset improved profitability at the Geico car insurer, where accident claims fell. Profit also rose at the BNSF railroad, which shipped more consumer goods, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, where operating expenses declined. Net income totaled $26.25 billion, reflecting unrealized gains on Berkshire's stock investments including Apple. In May, Buffett said he expected Apple to remain Berkshire's largest stock investment, but selling made sense because the 21% federal tax rate on the gains would likely grow. Buffett \"wants to invest every penny he can in businesses that provide Berkshire an advantage. But at the same time he's willing to do nothing,\" said Tom Russo, a principal at Gardner Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who has invested in Berkshire since 1982. \"He'll be there ready and loaded when other investors are despairing or capital-constrained,\" Russo added.

The attack on a United Airlines flight Monday from San Francisco to Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia lasted about a minute. “Thanks to the quick action of our crew and customers, one passenger was restrained after becoming physically aggressive toward another customer,” United said in a statement. “The flight landed safely and was met by paramedics and local law enforcement.” United said there were 82 customers and six crew members on the flight. According to an FBI affidavit, Nelson left his seat in the rear of the plane and used a lavatory near the front before attacking the other man, who suffered bruises around his eyes and a gash on the nose. Blood was splattered on the the sleeves of Nelson’s windbreaker. The agent said Nelson was moved to a seat near the front of the plane and was watched by the passenger who had stopped the assault. There was no indication that Nelson knew the victim, who was not identified. The public defender listed as Nelson's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A federal magistrate ruled that Nelson should be held in custody until trial, which is scheduled for Dec. 11 in Alexandria, Virginia. The magistrate cited the evidence against Nelson and his history of lacking stable employment and residence. There have been more than 1,700 reports of unruly passengers on planes this year, on pace for an increase in the number of incidents last year. Reports of unruly passengers spiked in 2021 and, although declining the next two years, have remained higher than before the coronavirus pandemic. ",

If Avenue fails to find a buyer, it may explore winding down the fund and dismissing employees, the people said. Spokespeople for Avenue and the New York state pension fund declined to comment. Avenue currently oversees more than $400 million in its first Sustainable Solutions Fund, roughly $300 million of which came from New York state’s pension fund in 2020. Lasry’s firm had been seeking to raise at least as much for a second fund, the people said. The pension fund opted to avoid a second round amid concerns over the high rate of staff turnover at Avenue’s impact business, the people said. Between the first fund launch and efforts to raise money for the second, departures by key portfolio managers and fund employees included Peter Pulkkinen and Rhys Marsh, both of whom now work at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. New hires for the fund in that period include Sean Coleman from FS Investments. John Larkin, head of impact investments, has remained throughout. Pulkkinen, Marsh and Coleman didn’t reply to messages seeking comment. Larkin declined to comment.

To date, investments have included companies developing so-called scooper planes used to fight wildfires, as well as green household cleaning products and biofuels. The development coincides with a broader retreat from ESG strategies as investment managers have struggled to persuade clients they can generate adequate returns. Funds that have focused on renewable energy have been particularly hard hit, with the S&P Global Clean Energy Index down 17% so far in 2024, putting it on track for a fourth consecutive year of losses.

By Bill Stephens Most British Columbia port terminals will shut down on Monday morning amid a labor dispute between the union representing 700 forepersons and the B.C. Maritime Employers Association. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 514 has issued a 72-hour strike notice and plans to walk off the job beginning at 8 a.m. on Nov. 4. The BCMEA, meanwhile, says it will lock out employees Monday morning in order to facilitate an orderly shutdown. The dispute will halt freight shipments through the ports of Vancouver — Canada’s busiest — and Prince Rupert. Grain will continue to be loaded onto ships, however. The work stoppage will have an immediate impact on Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City traffic volumes in Canada. International intermodal traffic bound for Chicago and other points in the Midwest is the most likely freight to be diverted away from the British Columbia ports, which went through a 13-day strike this past summer that prompted shippers to send volume to U.S. West Coast ports. In September CN and CPKC sent an average of seven eastbound intermodal trains per day out of Vancouver, according to data from RailState, a firm that uses a network of sensors and cameras to monitor rail traffic. CN, meanwhile, handled an average of 1.5 intermodal trains per day out of Prince Rupert. A brief work stoppage halted rail traffic in August on CN and CPKC due to a contract dispute with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference. “This strike will be the latest blow to the global reputation of Canada’s supply-chain, which will take time to recover,” TD Securities analyst Cherilyn Radbourne wrote in a note to clients. The latest port labor dispute has centered around terminal operator DP World and its use of automation. In a bid to prevent a work stoppage, the union and employers association had been negotiating with the assistance of a federal mediator this week. In eastern Canada, dockworkers at the Port of Montreal walked off the job Thursday morning, forcing the indefinite shutdown of two container terminals. The walkout at Canada’s second-busiest port follows a three-day overtime strike at the same container terminals earlier this month over scheduling.

The agreement resolves a case filed by the U.S. Justice Department a week ago in San Francisco federal court on Oct. 25 — the same day that Lyft disclosed it had negotiated the terms of the settlement revolving around the same issues with the Federal Trade Commission. U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Kang signed an order formalizing the settlement Thursday before it was made publicly available Friday. Besides having to pay $2.1 million, Lyft also has been prohibited from engaging in the misleading practices flagged in the case. Both the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have been investigating Lyft since uncovering evidence that it was advertising inflated compensation rates while trying to to recruit more drivers as the pandemic began to ease and ride-hailing demand perked up. The lawsuit alleged Lyft exaggerated the amounts that its drivers could make in a variety of major U.S. cities from April 2021 through June 2022. Lyft advertised drivers could make more than $40 per hour in cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston and more than $30 per hour in cities such as Atlanta, Dallas and Miami. But those figures were based on the earnings among the top 20% of Lyft's drivers, leaving them unattainable for most others who picked up passengers for the ride-hailing service, the lawsuit alleged. much as $44 per hour in San Francisco. “The Justice Department will vigorously enforce the law to stop companies from misleading Americans about their potential earnings in the gig economy,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton said in a Friday statement. Lyft has already changed many of the practices cited in the lawsuit and is now overseen by a CEO, David Risher, who came on board last year. “We agreed to this settlement because we recognize the importance of transparency in maintaining trust in the communities we serve,” Lyft said last week when it first disclosed the agreement with the Federal Trade Commission.

However, rather than directly invest in bitcoin, the majority of these retirement funds are focusing on bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which debuted this January, and allow pension funds to gain bitcoin exposure without buying the underlying asset themselves. In July, disclosure forms showed that Michigan’s state pension fund, which manages $143.9 million in assets for Michigan state employees, took out a $6.6 million investment in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. Similarly, this past May, Wisconsin’s state pension fund reported it had invested $160 million in two bitcoin ETFs. These retirement funds are vital for elderly police officers, firefighters, and teachers on the state pension. However, critics argue that lobbyists are pressuring state pension funds to pursue riskier crypto investments, despite the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. Even seasoned financial advisers warn that investors should reduce exposure to risky assets as they approach retirement. Bitcoin lobbying groups, such as the Satoshi Action Fund, have promoted bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as offering high returns for investors. They argue that bitcoin's price has the potential to exceed that of more stable assets like gold. It's an argument that some state pension funds have already bought into. “When managing state pensions for firefighters, teachers, and police officers, it's also essential to prioritize the bottom line and ensure the best return on investment for Floridians,” Patronis wrote in a letter to the state board overseeing state retirement funds to request the addition of more crypto to Florida's pension fund. “This is where the potential of investing in a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, becomes particularly compelling.” ",

For an even deeper look at all of the financial issues that matter most to your pocketbook, please see Yahoo Finance’s interactive guide to the 2024 election. Whichever candidate prevails this November will immediately become the loudest voice in a fierce tax debate set to consume Washington in 2025. Policymakers will have to decide what to do about cuts signed into law in 2017 that expire at the end of the first year of the next president's term. There is one area of significant agreement within the sprawling debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump: They both think taxpayers who make under $400,000 a year should see their tax cuts extended. But that's about it. The two nominees disagree on how to pay the tab, and both want to push other far-reaching — not to mention expensive — priorities into any final bill. What Trump is promising is a complete extension of the cuts for individuals of all income levels, included in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, alongside a dizzying array of additional promises from no taxes on tips and overtime to lowering taxes for big business. All told, a complete Trump tax agenda comes with a price tag in the neighborhood of $9 trillion over the coming decade, according to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). And he laid out nary a concrete way to pay for it all. Harris, meanwhile, has signaled a different tax approach — only pushing to extend cuts for those making less than $400,000 a year alongside a new expansion of things like the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit. But it's still a hefty price tag, likely above $4 trillion, with the vice president laying out tax increases elsewhere to try and balance out the costs. \"The composition of Congress is critical,\" said Charles Myers, the chairman and founder of Signum Global Advisors and former adviser to figures like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Read more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts He noted that a scenario in which either president faces at least one chamber of Congress controlled by the opposition, which he sees as the most likely scenario, will quickly force a massive lowering of expectations. \"As long as we have divided Congress,\" he said in a recent interview \"literally almost every tax proposal, whether it's Trump promising to cut taxes for everyone [to] Harris's corporate tax cap gain tax, taxing unrealized cap gains, none of that happens.\"                                    ",

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Exxon’s third-quarter adjusted earnings exceeded expectations by a nickel on Friday, while Chevron surpassed estimates by 11 cents. The strong results underpinned the companies’ commitments to continue rewarding investors with hefty buybacks and payouts — in contrast to European rival BP Plc, which earlier this week warned fluctuating oil prices may imperil some share repurchases. Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE haven’t wavered on buyback pledges, although the French oil titan noted its pace of purchasing depends on “reasonable market conditions.” Exxon shares initially rose, then slipped 0.8% Chevron surged as much as 4.8%, the most intraday in nearly 19 months. Despite the 20% decline in oil prices since early April, Exxon had ample cash flow to cover third-quarter payouts, while Chevron’s fell short, forcing the supermajor to rely on borrowing. Exxon is the best-performing oil major this year, rising more than 15% even as international crude prices declined. North America’s largest energy explorer demonstrated it has more oil and natural gas production growth — and at lower cost — than peers. Exxon increased dividends for the 42nd consecutive year to 99 cents a share, higher than the 97-cent Bloomberg Dividend Projection. Exxon was able to “fully fund” dividend payouts and share repurchases with cash flow without resorting to debt, Chief Financial Officer Kathy Mikells said during an interview. The company also has a $27 billion cash pile and a net-debt-to-capital ratio of just 5%, leaving it in a “strong position” ahead of any oil-market downturn, she said. “We have done a lot of work to fundamentally improve the underlying earnings power of the business and that’s going to put us in really good stead,” Mikells said. Exxon’s fast-growing oil developments in Guyana and the Permian Basin are producing crude for less than $35 a barrel at a time when a barrel fetches more than $70, and Exxon is working on several gas-export projects in Texas, Papua New Guinea and Mozambique. It’s now the biggest producer in the Permian region after its $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. earlier this year.                          ",

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround The economy expanded at a robust pace in the third quarter, continuing several years of solid growth, and the unemployment rate has remained low. That’s a far cry from the recession economists had long expected. Granted, it’s not all positive. Job growth slowed to the weakest pace since 2020 in October, a month distorted by severe hurricanes and a major strike, and the path to cooler inflation continues to prove bumpy. Meanwhile, high mortgage rates and house prices have pushed homeownership further out of reach for many Americans. Voters have long been frustrated with the economy under President Joe Biden, which has featured the worst inflation in a generation, a housing affordability crisis and some of the highest interest rates in decades. At the same time, price pressures have rarely subsided so quickly, let alone without triggering a recession. According to the so-called misery index, which adds up the inflation rate and unemployment rate, Americans shouldn’t be miserable at all. The widely used welfare gauge is lower than in any recent election year, except for 2016. It’s a difficult message to convey for Vice President Kamala Harris, who’s tried to tout the administration’s victories while communicating to voters how she’ll be different from her boss. Former President Donald Trump has cast his opponent as overseeing “the worst economy in your life” in his bid to return to the White House, but growth is still powering ahead. Here’s the latest picture of the US economy heading into Election Day: Labor Market Nonfarm payrolls increased just 12,000 last month, hampered by Hurricanes Helene and Milton as well as a strike at Boeing Co. But hiring over the previous two months was weaker than previously thought, indicating the labor market is still softening beyond the temporary factors. The job market is moderating from the unsustainable strength of the pandemic recovery, but economists certainly wouldn’t describe it as weak. Unemployment, while somewhat higher in recent months, is still historically low, and wage growth has outpaced inflation for more than a year. Employers are also still trying to fill over 7 million job openings.                       ",

In a statement, the Commerce Department said GlobalFoundries sent 74 shipments worth $17.1 million to SJ Semiconductor, an affiliate of SMIC, without seeking a license. Both SMIC and SJ Semiconductor were added to a trade restriction list known as the entity list in 2020 over SMIC's alleged ties to the Chinese military-industrial complex. SMIC has denied wrongdoing. Exports to firms on the list require a difficult-to-obtain license, which GlobalFoundries did not apply for, the department said. “We want U.S. companies to be hypervigilant when sending semiconductor materials to Chinese parties,” Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod said in a statement that highlighted GlobalFoundries' voluntary disclosure of the violation and extensive cooperation with the Commerce Department. SMIC, SJ Semiconductor did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement, GlobalFoundries said the company regrets \"the inadvertent action, due to a data-entry error made prior to the entity listing,\" which caused it to accidentally ship the legacy chips without a license. \"We strive to, and believe we have, a world-class trade compliance program that sets the standard for the foundry industry,\" it added. U.S. lawmakers have grown more concerned that the Commerce Department, which oversees export policy, may not be aggressively enforcing its regulations as Washington seeks to stop China from receiving sensitive U.S. technology that could bolster its military. Influential Democratic Senator Mark Warner criticized the Biden administration for \"apparent lax monitoring\" of TSMC following revelations a chip produced by the Taiwanese chipmaker ended up in a product made by China's heavily sanctioned Huawei, Reuters reported on Thursday. It also comes as GlobalFoundries, majority owned by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, is slated to receive around $1.5 billion from the Commerce Department to build a new semiconductor production facility in Malta, New York, and expand existing operations there and in Burlington, Vermont. The grant is part of a U.S. program to encourage chipmakers to expand production in the United States.

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Forty-one participants on Friday put a combined $155 billion at the Fed’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, known as the RRP, which is used by banks, government-sponsored enterprises and money-market mutual funds to earn interest. It marks a steep decline from a record $2.55 trillion stashed on Dec. 30, 2022, according to New York Fed data. The number of counterparties was the smallest since June 2021. The latest decline in usage comes as elevated funding rates lure cash away from the central bank. The facility offers a rate of 4.8%, while funding rates traded at 4.93%/4.92% at one point on Friday. “The decline in usage suggests that money-market investors are amply supplied with alternatives and see other products as more attractive compared with RRP,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US interest rates strategy at TD Securities. Market participants are watching the pace at which the facility’s remaining balances decline. Some on Wall Street warn a drop is evidence that excess liquidity has been removed from the financial system amid the Fed’s balance-sheet runoff, known as quantitative tightening. In June, the central bank started reducing the amount of Treasuries it lets roll off every month and therefore easing potential strain on money-market rates. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association’s annual meeting in October that it would be appropriate to operate with only “negligible balances” in the RRP. She also said some demand may be stickier as users value overnight assets or face counterparty credit limits for repo in the private market. Logan also surmised if the remaining RRP balances don’t evaporate as repo rates rise, then policymakers could alter the offering rate on the facility to incentivize participants to shift to private markets. From the time the government suspended the debt ceiling in late June 2023 until early April this year, demand for the Fed’s facility dropped by nearly $1.6 trillion as a deluge of bill supply siphoned cash from the market. While some on Wall Street predicted the RRP to be completely emptied in the first half, drainage has since slowed and somewhat stabilized.          ",

About a dozen cars await servicing in the shop as a dog Hooks adopted the day before barks in its new cage. Exercise equipment, motorcycles and power tools abut the kitchen on the side of the renovated building where his wife cooks a meal. At 6 feet, 2 inches, and with a sturdy build, Hooks has a graying beard and a head of curls he says could be laced with snow flurries by this time of year. “I’ve got to be one of the only Black businesses on this street,” he says, noting that his repair shop stands on Peach Street, one of the city's main traffic arteries. He appreciates the greetings from passersby. But he says many people who know him from the neighborhoods where he grew up will never step foot in the shop. Almost all his customers are white. Hooks, 58, is a member of a coveted demographic in this year's election — a Black man and a business owner in a swing state. Both presidential campaigns have targeted Black entrepreneurs with their messaging, offering a range of economic policies and legislation that each side says will boost the careers and lives of African Americans. How Erie business owners and voters such as Hooks view each candidate's economic vision could determine control of the White House.

Trump has stressed his promise of sweeping tariffs, new corporate tax cuts and an unprecedented crackdown on illegal and legal immigration to the country. Local leaders are weighing the impact of each agenda on their plans to renew the Rust Belt. “A lack of predictability would be the worst possible thing,” said Drew Whiting, CEO of the Erie Downtown Development Corporation, which is directing more than $100 million in private investment to the downtown area.

China traffic underpinned significantly higher y/y freight rates with strong peak-season demand, along with higher rates in domestic trade lanes. “A resilient U.S. economy and a stable consumer demand environment coupled with tighter supply chain conditions supported these elevated freight rates,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Matthew Cox in the release. “In the near term, we expect freight rates to moderate with normal seasonality, but remain elevated as long as the underlying economic, supply chain, and geopolitical conditions persist.” Gains were seen in container volumes to and from China, up 2.6% to 40,000 forty foot equivalent units from 39,000 FEUs on two additional sailings, and Alaska, up 1.4% to 22,000 FEUs from 21,900 FEUs on higher retail-related demand. Hawai’i volume declined 2.2% to 36,200 FEUs from 37,000 FEUs on lower general demand. Hawai’i automobile shipments slowed 16.8% to 8,400 units from 10,100 units in 2023. Matson expects Hawai’i container volume for all of 2024 to be modestly lower than 2023 primarily due to stalled tourism; continued challenges in the state’s population growth, and lower discretionary income as a result of higher inflation and interest rates. Matson revised guidance, saying it expects total fourth-quarter operating income to be “meaningfully higher” than $75.3 million in the 2023 fourth quarter. Find more articles by Stuart Chirls here.

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Yet in a distant corner of its empire, far from the attention of top executives in Geneva and Singapore, a crisis has been brewing for some time. This week, the company admitted it faces a loss in Mongolia of up to $1.1 billion, linked in part to suspected fraud by its own employees. Trafigura alleges that staff manipulated payments while concealing a mountain of overdue debts, allowing the exposure to run out of control for years without raising any red flags. For people inside and outside Trafigura, the revelation was a bombshell. Most shocking was the scale of the likely loss relative to the size of Mongolia's oil market. There are over 100 countries that use more oil than Mongolia, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration, among them Luxembourg and Nepal. Its consumption of about 35,000 barrels a day is worth roughly $1 billion a year. For Trafigura, Mongolia made up less than 0.3% of all the oil it traded. This account is based on interviews with eight people with direct knowledge of Trafigura and its activities in Mongolia, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the subject. This week, Trafigura Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Weir said the company was \"bitterly disappointed\" by the situation and was confident it was isolated to the Mongolia business, and the company's investigation is still ongoing. This week’s announcement, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg, represents a painful sequel to last year’s revelation that Trafigura had fallen victim to a massive alleged nickel fraud. The debacle is shining another harsh light on the company’s internal controls, and raises questions about why it took almost a year to fully disclose the situation. For outsiders, it reinforces commodity trading’s fast-and-loose reputation, coming months after some of the biggest players — including Trafigura itself — pleaded guilty to corruption charges in the US.

Vadim Yermolenko, 43, faces up to 30 years in prison for his role in a transnational procurement and money laundering network that sought to acquire sensitive electronics for Russian military and intelligence services, Breon Peace, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement. Yermolenko, who lives in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey and has dual U.S. and Russian citizenship, was indicted along with six other people in December 2022. Prosecutors said the conspirators worked with two Moscow-based companies controlled by Russian intelligence services to acquire electronic components in the U.S. that have civilian uses but can also be used to make nuclear and hypersonic weapons and in quantum computing. The exporting of the technology violated U.S. sanctions, prosecutors said. The prosecution was coordinated through the Justice Department’s Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency entity dedicated to enforcing sanctions imposed after Russian invaded Ukraine. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in statement that Yermolenko “joins the nearly two dozen other criminals that our Task Force KleptoCapture has brought to justice in American courtrooms over the past two and a half years for enabling Russia’s military aggression.” A message seeking comment was sent to Yermolenko's attorney with the federal public defender's office. Prosecutors said Yermolenko helped set up shell companies and U.S. bank accounts to move money and export-controlled goods. Money from one of his accounts was used to purchase export-controlled sniper bullets that were intercepted in Estonia before they could be smuggled into Russia, they said. One of Yermolenko's co-defendants, Alexey Brayman of Merrimack, New Hampshire, pleaded guilty previously to conspiracy to defraud the United States and is awaiting sentencing. Another, Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected officer with Russia’s Federal Security Service, was arrested in Estonia and extradited to the United States. He was later released from U.S. custody as part of a prisoner exchange that included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and other individuals. The four others named in the indictment are Russian nationals who remain at large, prosecutors said. ",

The newly formed Office of Technology Enablement will be led by Jamie Voris, who spearheaded development of Disney's app for the Apple Vision Pro mixed reality device, according to an email seen on Friday by Reuters. \"The pace and scope of the advances in AI and XR (extended reality) are profound and will continue to impact consumer experiences, creative endeavors and our businesses for years to come - making it critical that Disney explore the exciting opportunities and navigate the potential risks,\" Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman wrote. \"The creation of this group underscores our dedication to doing that.\" Bergman noted the unit will focus on fast-moving areas of technology, such as AI and mixed reality, which blends the physical and digital worlds. It will not centralize work on these projects, but rather, ensure the various projects around the company fit with its broader strategy. Reuters first reported Disney had formed a task force to study artificial intelligence and how it could be applied across the entertainment conglomerate. Various divisions within Disney are exploring applications for augmented reality, which places digital elements into the real world, virtual reality, which immerses the user in a simulated environment, and mixed reality which combines both. Disney has been building expertise across the organization to capitalize on the emerging technology. For example, Kyle Laughlin, a Disney veteran with a background in augmented and virtual reality and artificial intelligence, returned to the company in March as senior vice president of research and development for Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative force behind Disney's theme park attractions. He briefly left Disney in 2019 to lead Amazon's Alexa Gadgets division. As Meta and Snap unveiled a new generation of lightweight glasses that provide consumers a fashionable alternative to bulky VR goggles, Disney has been quietly assembling a team focused on how best to harness the technology to bring new experiences to the company's theme parks and consumers' homes, the sources say. Tech companies have sold about 1.7 million AR/VR headsets so far this year, data from market research firm IDC showed. Meta is still the clear market leader, with a 60.5% market share, but is starting to face pressure in the space from competitors like Sony, Apple and ByteDance.

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Yields climbed across the curve on Friday, reversing an early decline that came after data showed the economy generated just 12,000 jobs last month amid storms and strikes. Longer-dated yields led the advance in New York afternoon trading, while a key gauge of the dollar headed for its strongest closing level since July. “This is a time when you’ve got to take a very holistic view,” Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queens’ College, Cambridge and Bloomberg Opinion columnist, said on Bloomberg TV. “We have some major events coming up.” Traders held tight to expectations that policymakers will cut rates by a quarter-point on Nov. 7 and again on Dec. 18, pricing in 44 basis points by year’s end. They see 57 basis points of cumulative easing by the end of January, implying the potential that Fed officials pause their reductions early next year. Unlike last month, when several banks changed their Fed forecasts based on stronger-than-expected employment data, the October report drew only affirmations of the widespread forecast for quarter-point rate cuts next week and in December. Citigroup stuck with its call for a half-point move in December. Friday’s job report showed just 12,000 jobs created in October, with severe hurricanes and a major strike causing the data to come in well below the median economist forecast of 100,000. The prior month’s total was revised lower to 223,000 from 254,000. “While the Fed will likely attribute some of the weakness in today’s data to one-off factors, the softness in today’s data argues for the Fed to continue its easing cycle at next week’s meeting,” said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “Sky clearing for a November 25-basis-point cut.” To Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree, a pause in the Fed’s rate-cutting cycle after two more quarter-point reductions in 2024 would likely leave Treasury yields stuck around their current levels. What Bloomberg strategists say... “Low conviction is in part due to Tuesday’s US presidential election and Thursday’s Federal Reserve meeting. Had it not been for these two pending events, a big miss on headline payrolls and downward revisions would have elicited a much bigger slide in yields.”                  ",

We will announce a specific forecast in January,\" said Narasimhan, who has led Novartis since 2018. \"In the past, the expiry of major patents in our industry has often led to declining sales, but this is not to be feared at Novartis.\" The company will not, however, increase its core operating profit margin much beyond the current level of 40.1%, Narasimhan said. \"I consider a margin in the low 40% range to be sufficient - higher margins are generally not rewarded in the pharmaceutical industry as they come at the expense of investments in research, development and sales growth,\" he said. Novartis will also consider acquisitions, with a focus on bolt-on deals worth less than $1 billion. \"Of course, we will continue to look for deals of up to $10 billion or more,\" Narasimhan said. \"However, our analysis shows that the track record of such deals in the sector has historically been rather poor.\" (Reporting by John Revill; editing by Jason Neely) ",

The delegates also agreed to oblige major corporations to share the financial benefits of research when using natural genetic resources. Indigenous delegations erupted into cheers and tears after the historic decision to create the subidiary body was annouced. It recognizes and protects the traditional knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples and local communities for the benefit of global and national biodiversity management, said Sushil Raj, Executive Director of the Rights and Communities Global Program at the Wildlife Conservation Society. “It strengthens representation, coordination, inclusive decision making, and creates a space for dialogue with parties to the COP,” Raj told The Associated Press, referring to the formal name of the gathering, Conference of Parties. Negotiators had struggled to find common ground on some key issues in the final week but came to a consensus after talks went late into Friday. The COP16 summit, hosted in Cali, Colombia, was a follow-up to the historic 2022 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures to save Earth’s plant and animal life, including putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030. A measure to recognize the importance of the role of people of African descent in the protection of nature was also adopted in Cali. The Indigenous body will be formed by two co-chairs elected by COP: one nominated by U.N. parties of the regional group, and the other nominated by representatives of Indigenous peoples and local communities, the AP saw in the final document. At least one of the co-chairs will be selected from a developing country, taking into account gender balance, the document said. “With this decision, the value of the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities is recognized, and a 26-year-old historical debt in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is settled,” Susana Muhamad, Colombia’s environment minister and COP16 president, posted on social media platform X shortly after the announcement.

But the preponderance of evidence from official data, company earnings and even consumers points to a strong, if gradually slowing, economy. There was even more attention than usual on Friday’s jobs figure, coming as it did just days before the presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s next rate-setting meeting. But no one should panic about the October employment report, which showed the economy adding just 12,000 jobs for the month. There were multiple distortions bringing it down, including a strike at Boeing and two major hurricanes. These affected not only the number of people working but also the survey collection methods of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Attempting to divine from this figure how the economy is performing at a macro level would be foolhardy.

Perhaps more worrying would be the downward revisions in estimates for job growth in August and September, by a combined 112,000. But even after taking these into account, the trend through September looks mild. In the three months through September, the economy added an average of 148,000 jobs a month, basically unchanged from 147,000 through June. That is down from an average of 267,000 jobs a month in the three-month period through March, but this pace of deceleration is actually consistent with what the Federal Reserve wants to see, to be reassured that inflation pressures will remain on a downward path. Doubts about the reliability of the October jobs report should lead interested observers to look at other indications of the economy’s health. An obvious one is gross domestic product. Data released on Wednesday showed that it grew at a respectable 2.8% annual rate in the third quarter, adjusted for seasonality and inflation, down only slightly from 3% the prior quarter. Another useful indicator is also currently at hand: Markets are currently in the middle of earnings season, when the bulk of publicly-listed American companies report their results for the quarter ending in September. They have been highly encouraging. Among S&P 500 companies that had reported through Oct. 31, earnings were up a robust 8.4% from a year earlier, according to an analysis by LSEG I/B/E/S. Excluding the volatile energy sector, which is being hit by lower oil prices, earnings were up 11.2%. Earnings were on average 7.8% better than estimates, far better than the historical average of 4.2%. Revenue growth was 4.8%, or 5.9% excluding energy.            ",

Barbara Lee (D), a member of the U.S. House of Representatives who serves California’s 12th Congressional district in the Oakland area, has signaled that she is interested in the role of secretary at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) if Vice President Kamala Harris is victorious in next week’s presidential election. Lee, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination to succeed the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, signaled her interest in leading HUD in an interview with Politico. “I’ve talked with organizations, and individuals, just about getting their feedback on these proposals — and people have been very excited,” Lee, 78, told the outlet. “People are very pleased that [Harris] has put forth this housing agenda; people have input and ideas.” She tempered the discussion somewhat by saying she remains focused on helping Harris secure the presidency. “Let’s get past Nov. 5 first,” Lee said. “I’m excited about what she’s doing, I think that I know these issues — and naturally, I would be interested in working with her administration on these issues.” Lee and Harris have a long history together as both hail from the Bay Area in California. Lee was also the first member of Congress to endorse Harris for president — in 2019, when Harris first sought the Democratic nomination before ultimately being named Joe Biden’s running mate. Lee served as co-chair of Harris’ first run for the presidency, and both served in the Congressional Black Caucus while Harris was a senator. Lee added that Harris could find “new, creative ways” to boost housing supply across the country when compared to the efforts of the Biden administration. Rep. Adam Schiff (D), who ultimately won the U.S. Senate Democratic primary and will seek to succeed Feinstein, said that Lee would be “an excellent choice in the Cabinet” since she has “the experience needed to serve on day one,” he told Politico. Lee has a reputation for being able to navigate bipartisan relationships without alienating more conservative colleagues with progressive politics, according to Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.). Politico sought comment from Harris’ transition team, but they did not reply to the overture. Should Harris be victorious next week, she will have some unique choices to make when building her cabinet. While some continuity with the Biden administration would be expected, that may not extend to personnel in some positions. Adrianne Todman is currently serving as acting secretary of HUD and could be nominated for full Senate confirmation, but Harris could also aim to signal a cleaner break with the current administration. When asked about potential Cabinet picks, Harris typically demurs, advising reporters and the public to wait until the election results are tabulated to see if these will be decisions she has to make.

        "body": "By Erwin Seba HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chemical maker LyondellBasell Industries on Friday detailed its long-announced plan to permanently shutter its 263,776 barrel-per-day (bpd) Houston oil refinery in the first quarter of 2025. The planned closing marks the latest in a wave of U.S. refinery closures as motor fuel demand is expected to peak this decade and decline under pressure from renewable fuels and electric vehicles. In January, one of the facility's crude distillation units (CDU) and coker production train will shut, Lyondell refining chief Kim Foley told analysts on a call to discuss third-quarter results. In February, the second CDU-coker production train, which supplies the gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracker (FCC) and ancillary units, will shut, ending motor fuel production, Foley said. For the fourth quarter of this year, Lyondell plans to run the refinery at 90% of its capacity. Lyondell originally planned to shutter the Houston refinery in 2023, but extended its life due to strong fuel margins. Last month, rival U.S. refiners Phillips 66 and Valero Energy announced plans to close one California refinery and put two others under review for possible closure in that state. Phillips 66's 139,000-bpd Los Angeles refinery will cease production by the end of 2025. \"The refinery, if you think back historically, was originally designed to process in-state California crude production, and that has declined by about 75%,\" CEO Mark Lashier said. Valero CEO Lane Riggs said last month \"all options are the table\" for the company's 91,300-bpd Wilmington and 145,000-bpd Benicia, California, refineries. New California laws for maintaining emergency inventories would penalize operators and make their refineries unprofitable, Valero said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In the last wave of U.S. refinery closures, which occurred between 2017 and 2022, nine crude oil refineries with a combined capacity of 1.2 million bpd were idled or converted to production of renewable fuels.

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Hedge funds, asset managers and other speculators held some $17.8 billion in bullish dollar positions as of Oct. 29, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. They added more than $8 billion worth of bullish bets in the week, after abandoning a negative outlook in mid-October. The increase in bullish expectations for the US currency comes ahead of the closely contested race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Some on Wall Street are hedging for an eventual protectionist pivot in trade policies by the US. “A tighter election increases market uncertainty and benefits the dollar, given its safe haven characteristics,” said Aroop Chatterjee, a strategist at Wells Fargo. Resilient US economic data that takes pressure off the Federal Reserve to quickly cut interest rates has also contributed to this move, he said. The dollar climbed on Friday, while the price to hedge against swings in the currency surged to the highest since April 2020, when the global pandemic was sending shock waves through the financial markets. A measure of one-week implied volatility on the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has been soaring heading into election. “As betting markets shift odds of a Trump presidency, even if polling might not necessarily be showing the same kind of a split, traders are responding with defensive positioning — which in this case means taking long dollar,” said Helen Given, a foreign-exchange trader at Monex. That’s “at least until markets can gauge the severity of either incoming administration’s trade policies.” On Wall Street, strategists widely agree that Trump’s vowed tariffs would, at least in the short term, support the dollar and hurt currencies such as the Chinese yuan and Mexican peso. But Trump has also argued that the world’s reserve currency is too strong. How he balances those competing ideas remain to be seen. A Harris administration, by contrast, is seen by Wells Fargo’s Chatterjee as likely to bring less uncertainty around US policymaking — from trade and immigration to foreign policy. That could weigh on the dollar’s safe-haven appeal. A Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress would lead to higher social spending, a scenario that would also weaken the dollar, according to analysts at Convera.             ",

        "body": "ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia's state government is diverting $100 million to spend on loans to farmers and cleanup after Hurricane Helene. The Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission voted unanimously Friday to spend the money, which had been set aside for construction projects or paying off existing debt. Officials last month estimated that the storm, which caused extensive damage in the eastern half of the state after a Sept. 26 landfall in Florida, caused $6.46 billion in economic losses in the state's agriculture and forestry industries. Cotton, pecan and chicken farmers took severe losses, as did owners of private timberlands. Lt Gov. Burt Jones and others have called the damage a “generational loss.” The Georgia Development Authority, a state agency that lends money to farmers, will get $75 million to provide disaster relief loans to farmers and associated businesses in the agricultural industry. The other $25 million will be spent to clean up timber losses and other debris, said Garrison Douglas, a spokesperson for Gov. Brian Kemp. Because Georgia has been flush with surplus cash, it has been paying for construction projects using cash, instead of the traditional method of selling bonds to borrow money. The $100 million was being held for future spending, but it hadn't been allotted to any project that is already underway, Douglas said. Because Georgia ended last year with a $2 billion surplus, lawmakers may be able to replace the $100 million when they amend the current budget during the 2025 legislative session that begins in January. The state did not spend similar money after 2018's Hurricane Michael. Helene's damage to agriculture has been estimated as more than twice as costly as Michael. The earlier storm was followed by a federal fight over aid that delayed help to farmers. Georgia itself spent more than $470 million on loans and recovery after Michael. “This is something we learned we could do,” Douglas said of the $100 million. Kemp and other state leaders say they will consider additional relief both when the General Assembly meets in January, as well as through administrative measurers before then. “We’ll continue to work with stakeholders on all levels to direct resources and support to the hardworking Georgians devastated by this storm,” Kemp said in a statement Friday. Kemp, Georgia state House Speaker Jon Burns and others have been urging Congress to act quickly on a relief package for Hurricanes Helene and Milton. They are asking Congress to give block grants to states that the states can then give to farmers for recovery purposes. Burns is urging similar block grants that states could spend to repair damaged infrastructure and help private businesses and citizens.      ",

Nvidia will join the index next week along with paint-maker Sherwin-Williams , which will replace Dow, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday. Once the dominant force in chipmaking, Intel has in recent years ceded its manufacturing edge to rival TSMC and missed out on the generative artificial intelligence boom after missteps including passing on an investment in ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Intel's shares have declined 54% this year, making the company the worst performer on the index and leaving it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. Shares of Intel fell 1.6% in extended trading on Friday, while those of Nvidia were up 2.2%. This development comes a day after Intel expressed optimism about the future of its PC and server businesses, projecting current-quarter revenue above estimates but warning that it had \"a lot of work to do.\" \"Losing the status of Dow Jones inclusion would be another reputational blow for Intel, as it grapples with a painful transformation and loss of confidence,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"It would also mean that Intel is not included in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which track the index, which could impact the share price further.\" Launched in 1968, the Silicon Valley pioneer sold memory chips before switching to processors that helped launch the personal computer industry. In the 1990s, \"Intel Inside\" stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. Intel's revenue was $54 billion in 2023, down nearly one-third from 2021, when Pat Gelsinger took over as CEO. Analysts expect Intel to report its first annual net loss this year since 1986. The company is worth less than $100 billion for the first time in 30 years. That pales in comparison to Nvidia, which is sitting at a $3.32 trillion valuation, making it the world's second-most valuable company. NVIDIA'S AI LEAD Nvidia has emerged as a cornerstone of the global semiconductor industry, thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI technologies which has driven a seven-fold surge in its shares over the past two years. The company's shares have risen more than two-fold this year alone.     ",

Portfolio managers borrow money from prime brokers to juice up hedge funds' return, but it can also magnify losses in case a trade goes wrong. Hedge funds have increased leverage in portfolios by 20.6% year to date, a trend that contrasts with positioning in the previous three U.S. elections cycle. In 2020, when Republican candidate Donald Trump and President Joe Biden were on the ticket, hedge funds trimmed leverage by 3.1% ahead of the election day. In the two previous election cycles, leverage also went up, but at a slower pace. In 2016, when Trump and democratic candidate Hillary Clinton were running, leverage rose by 12.1%, while in 2012, it increased by 5.6% when the nominees were Republican Mitt Romney and Democratic Barack Obama. Hedge funds' risk appetite for equities comes as stocks have posted a stellar performance so far this year, on the back of a strong U.S. economy and great optimism about tech.

        "body": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Friday announced that it is seeking a settlement with Chicago-based Townstone Financial that would resolve a case over what the bureau calls “discriminatory lending practices and redlining African American neighborhoods in Chicago.” The proposed order would prohibit Townstone from taking any action that would violate the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and require Townstone to pay a penalty of $105,000 into the CFPB’s victims relief fund. Townstone characterized the settlement as “favorable” in a statement submitted to HousingWire after this story was originally published. It detailed that one element of the settlement is that “Barry Sturner, Townstone’s president and CEO, was dismissed from the case, and Townstone neither admits nor denies liability for the actions alleged in the complaint.” “My family and I are relieved to finally put this nightmare behind us,” said Sturner in a statement. “The last six years have taken a toll on all of us.” Steve Simpson, senior attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) who is representing Townstone in this matter, said the case should never have been brought. “Unfortunately, the federal government possesses vast resources and the power to destroy lives and livelihoods, so settling is often the best approach for anyone facing a lawsuit of this kind,” Simpson said. The PLF will “continue to fight overreach by CFPB and other federal agencies,” the organization said. The move toward this resolution follows a lengthy court battle, along with a July decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit that reaffirmed the Bureau’s authority to prohibit discrimination against credit applicants and from discouraging prospective applicants for credit under the ECOA. “The CFPB’s lawsuit against Townstone Financial included a major appellate court victory that makes clear that people are protected from illegal redlining even before they submit their application,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. “The CFPB will continue to prosecute those who engage in modern-day redlining.” In the summer of 2020, the CFPB filed suit against Townstone, alleging that it violated Regulation B of the ECOA by drawing “almost no applications for properties in majority-African-American neighborhoods” and ”few applications from African Americans” in the Chicago metro area. This amounted to discrimination, the CFPB alleged. In October 2020, Townstone moved to have the case dismissed. A federal judge in Illinois ruled in favor of Townstone in February 2023, but the CFPB vowed to appeal, which ultimately resulted in its authority under ECOA being reaffirmed by a three-judge panel.

Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround The finance ministry and the monetary authority share the view that a much—anticipated plan to cut public spending will shore up investors’ confidence in Brazil’s fiscal rules and alleviate pressure for a more aggressive tightening campaign, according to a member of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s economic team. And while fiscal woes exist, they’re not big enough to justify an interest rate increase of 75 basis points that traders threatened to price in last week, the person said, requesting anonymity to discuss the thinking of the economic team. Brazil’s central bank kicked off a monetary tightening campaign in September to fight inflation that’s speeding up above the 3% target — largely because government spending is making consumer demand more resilient. The bank is widely expected to step up the pace next week, delivering a half-point increase that would take the benchmark Selic to 11.25%, after an initial quarter-point hike. Yet central bank board members have adopted a more nuanced rhetoric about fiscal concerns. After months of warnings about the importance of delivering on fiscal pledges, policymakers are now saying that the risk premium priced into Brazilian assets is exaggerated and likely to be reversed by a positive fiscal shock. Governor Roberto Campos Neto went as far as telling investors to wait for good news on spending cuts following October’s municipal elections. “The central bank is making an effort to give a vote of confidence to the finance ministry,” said Guilherme Abbud, the CEO of Persevera Asset Management in Sao Paulo. Lula has increased spending since taking office in 2023 to fulfill campaign pledges of improving living standards for poor Brazilians. Public coffers have come under additional pressure this year as the administration responds to disasters including historic floods in May, followed by widespread forest fires and record drought. The message that Finance Minister Fernando Haddad is now conveying to Lula is that the government needs to rein in mandatory spending in coming months, said a person familiar with the minister’s thinking. The growth of some of those expenditures beyond the limit allowed by fiscal rules - 2.5% above inflation - will only create more pressure on the budget and spur public debt as time goes by.

The so-called good class bungalow sits on 1,446 square meters (15,568 square feet) of land at Dalvey Road, near the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Tao bought the house for S$28.5 million in 2020 and has since redeveloped it. Zhu, along with co-founder Kyle Davies, once built 3AC into one of the world’s largest crypto-native hedge funds. But it imploded in 2022 after a series of bad bets, amid a broader crypto rout and a spate of collapses in the sector. Since then, Zhu, who once boasted on social media about “buying all the good class bungalows in Singapore,” has seen his fortunes worsen further. In 2023, Singapore’s financial regulator imposed nine-year bans on Zhu and Davies from conducting regulated financial activities in the city, and Zhu was briefly jailed for a few months last year for failing to cooperate with the task of winding up Three Arrows. Teneo, the liquidators of 3AC, successfully sought a worldwide $1.14 billion freeze on the assets of Zhu, Davies, and Davies’ wife Kelly Chen last year, arguing that the fund’s creditors are owed roughly $3.3 billion. Assets subject to the disposal ban include another mansion in Singapore’s Yarwood Avenue, which Zhu bought with his wife for S$48.8 million in late 2021 in their role as trustees, and sought to sell in 2022, Bloomberg News previously reported. It also includes another smaller house owned by Zhu in Balmoral Road. Teneo didn’t respond to a phone call and email sent outside office hours. Zhu didn’t immediately answer a message sent via social media. The Dalvey house was purchased by Chrispianto Karim, a Singapore citizen, the records show. The Business Times, which earlier reported the transaction, said that he is a member of the Indonesian Karim family, which controls Musim Mas Group, a palm oil conglomerate headquartered in Singapore. --With assistance from Annie Lee.

        "body": "(Reuters) - The top U.S. consumer financial watchdog agency on Friday said it had reached a settlement in a long-running lawsuit with a Chicago mortgage lender over alleged racial discrimination. Under the terms of the proposed agreement, Townstone Financial would pay a $105,000 fine into the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's victims relief fund. In a statement on its website, the Pacific Legal Foundation, which represented Townstone, said the company neither admitted nor denied the allegations and settled due to government's superior legal resources. \"This case should never have been brought,\" attorney Steve Simpson said. WHY IT MATTERS The CFPB says the enforcement action follows the agency's July legal victory before the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which gave it new freedom to fight racial discrimination not only in lending but also in marketing of loans. It is the agency's second action on racial bias in the mortgage industry in less than three weeks. KEY QUOTE \"The CFPB's lawsuit against Townstone Financial included a major appellate court victory that makes clear that people are protected from illegal redlining even before they submit their application,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. CONTEXT In 2020, the CFPB accused Townstone Financial of discouraging Black people from applying for mortgages and avoiding the credit needs of African American neighborhoods in the Chicago area. In weekly marketing radio shows and podcasts, the company allegedly disparaged predominantly Black neighborhoods as crime ridden and the \"jungle.\" (Reporting by Douglas Gillison; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) ",

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted 2-1 late Friday against the proposal that would have increased the amount of power supplied to an Amazon.com Inc. data facility adjacent to Talen’s Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. The decision comes as data centers are poised to drive unprecedented growth in electricity demand. Artificial intelligence is evolving quickly, and the data centers being planned to support it use as much power as entire towns. But the concern is that such deals will allow them to shunt costs to other consumers. The FERC decision is “a major setback for the nuclear data center thesis,” Jefferies LLC analysts led by Julien Dumoulin-Smith said in a note. Constellation Energy Corp. tumbled as much as 13% in New York, its biggest intraday decline ever. The drop came even after the company reported strong third-quarter results and raised its guidance, citing surging demand from technology companies. Talen slumped as much as 8.6%, the most in three weeks, while Vistra Corp. fell as much as 6.7%. All three companies have seen their shares more than double this year amid very bullish predictions for artificial intelligence-driven power consumption. Amazon Web Services paid Talen $650 million in March for a 960-megawatt data center campus adjacent to Susquehanna, and signed a long-term agreement to buy power from the plant. “FERC’s decision will have a chilling effect on economic development in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Jersey,” Talen said in a statement, adding that it is evaluating its options. On Friday, FERC ruled on a rather routine, technical amendment made by the largest US grid operator on behalf of a Pennsylvania nuclear plant. In June, PJM Interconnection, which operates the eastern US grid, sought approval from FERC to increase the amount of power used onsite at Susquehanna to 480 MW from 300 MW. Utility owners American Electric Power Co. and Exelon Corp. opposed the move, arguing it could threaten grid reliability and raise customer rates. FERC ruled Friday that the plan didn’t adequately show why the special contract should be allowed under federal rules. The plan would set a precedent and the issues should be reviewed more closely, it said. Commission Chairman Willie Phillips dissented, saying that the grid operator addressed reliability issues and called the order “a step backward” for both electricity reliability and national security.

Nvidia's market cap rose 9.3% in October to $3.26 trillion, while the company's supplier, TSMC (TSMC34.SA), saw its market value increase 6.5% to $832.8 billion. The gains came after the world's largest contract chipmaker posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and gave a robust outlook for AI demand. Apple briefly ceded its top global market capitalization spot to Nvidia, with a 3% decline to $3.4 trillion last month on a modest growth forecast and sluggish sales in China, before bouncing back. The market values of Meta Platforms and Microsoft fell in October after both companies warned about escalating AI costs. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, maintained his positive outlook on AI, advising investors to use near-term volatility as an opportunity to increase exposure to quality AI stocks. \"We continue to favor select semi names and big tech, and we expect our AI portfolio to deliver 35% earnings growth in 2024 and 25% in 2025.\" In Asia, the market value of Tencent Holdings fell 9% to $483 billion in October, carried by a wider decline in Chinese shares due to sluggish economic data, geopolitical tensions and as investors paused to assess government support measures. US drugmaker Eli Lilly's (LLY) market value dropped 6.45% to $787.6 billion last month as its quarterly sales of high-profile weight-loss and diabetes drugs failed to meet Wall Street's sales estimates, resulting in a sharp decline in its shares.

In addition, the internet has introduced new ways of approaching leisure and lodging such as booking homes and longer-term accommodations. Traditional airlines, hotel, resorts, and cruise line companies must innovate to stay relevant in a market rife with innovation. Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Unfortunately, Marriott’s 3.5% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was sluggish. This shows it failed to expand in any major way, a rough starting point for our analysis.           ",

On average, the analysts said, the S&P 500 has traded down marginally in the month after the election and only finished higher about half the time. \"Given the lack of volatility around policy implications from the election this time, and the strong year-to-date gains, we would put the odds of some weakness over the next few weeks as higher,\" they said. \"Three and six months out, the story is a bit better, with gains coming about two-thirds of the time with average gains of about 2% per quarter.\" Buchbinder and Turnquist said that stocks have fared well under Democrats and Republicans, in unified and divided in governments and in polarizing political environments. \"Capitalism and corporate profits drive markets more than politics,\" they said. \"Narrow majorities in Congress take out extremes, helping to mitigate risk that bad economic policies substantially weaken the U.S. economy.\" Geopolitical threats are serious, no doubt, the analysts said, \"and can disrupt the U.S. economy temporarily, but our economy and financial markets are incredibly resilient.\" Updated at 12:42 PM EDT Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yields are holding steady at 4.297%, following an overnight slump of around 10 basis points, as investors look to the $27 Treasury market and broader foreign exchange movements for clues on the election outcome and its impact of global asset prices. \"Markets are seemingly scaling back some Trump trades, and we suspect the next two days can see some abnormal swings in (the dollar) due to tighter volatility conditions ahead of a closely contested and highly binary US election,\" said ING analyst Francesco Pesole.

It suggests the European Union's punitive tariffs are unlikely to stop China's leading players in key components and charging facilities from going global. The EU last month voted to impose additional tariffs of up to 35 per cent on Chinese-built pure-electric cars following an anti-subsidy investigation that began in September last year. The new duties are on top of the standard 10 per cent tariff applied to pure-electric cars made in China. The extra tariffs will be in effect for five years. \"China's EV charging technologies and batteries are the runaway leaders worldwide,\" said Davis Zhang, a senior executive at Suzhou Hazardtex, a supplier of specialised batteries. \"They are welcome by foreign consumers and business partners.

Wall Street expects the Las Vegas, Nevada-based company to report quarterly earnings at $1.01 per share, up from 99 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company projects to report revenue of $1.73 billion, compared to $1.67 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. On Oct. 22, Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Grambling maintained Wynn Resorts with an Overweight. He also raised the price target from $112 to $115. With the recent buzz around Wynn Resorts ahead of quarterly earnings, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. Wynn Resorts currently offers an annual dividend yield of 1.05%. That’s a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly, start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Wynn Resorts' $1.00 dividend: $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $574,080 worth of Wynn Resorts, or 6,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares, or $114,816 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. View more earnings on WYNN Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. WYNN Price Action: Shares of Wynn Resorts fell by 0.4% to close at $95.68 on Friday.

        "body": "By Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) -Blackstone's private wealth business plans to enter at least two new European markets next year to tap growing demand among the well-off, two executives at the company told Reuters. New York-based Blackstone has made attracting funds from wealthy individuals a key priority amid choppy market conditions and as private equity firms look to diversify their client base away from institutional clients. Blackstone's European wealth business currently has offices in London, Paris, Zurich, Milan and Frankfurt. It declined to say which new markets it would enter. Blackstone's wealth products have a minimum investment threshold of $10,000 to $25,000. The business has grown its private wealth assets globally to around $250 billion currently from $103 billion in 2020, or 23% of Blackstone's total $1.1 trillion in assets. Blackstone declined to say the value of its wealth assets in Europe. Navigating the fragmented European market and its myriad of regulatory regimes has posed challenges. France and Italy have been Blackstone's biggest growth markets in wealth, with Britain slower going, the executives said. \"This is not the United States of Europe. There's much more complexity, and I think [Blackstone] understands that,\" said Rashmi Madan, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in Blackstone's private wealth solutions group. But regulatory changes across Europe - including in Britain - to encourage retail investing in private markets were a \"positive sign\", Madan said. \"There's a growing change in Europe... that long-term investing is important.\" Britain is a core market for the wealth business, despite a growing number of very well-off people moving elsewhere since the 2016 Brexit vote, Madan said. She was speaking ahead of Britain's budget announcement last week, which raised some taxes on the rich. Blackstone declined to comment on the budget. To help expand the business, Blackstone has promoted Sheila Rapple to chief operating officer for EMEA wealth, who relocated to London from New York in October. \"I think there's massive opportunity,\" Rapple told Reuters, referring to Europe. CASHING OUT Blackstone is pinning its wealth expansion hopes on a range of semi-liquid 'evergreen' funds designed for retail investors, spanning private equity, credit and property. It will launch two new funds in credit and infrastructure early next year, initially in the U.S. Its products are typically sold to wealthy individuals through partnerships with local banks or wealth managers, such as French lender BNP Paribas and Italian insurer Generali.

        "body": "At one point or another, you’ve probably seen a stock’s ticker run across the bottom of a TV screen or noticed share prices flashing across the top of a news website. Perhaps you’ve even looked at a stock’s quote page. But what do the various terms and numbers shown there indicate? A quote page displays more than just the price of a stock — in fact, it can tell investors about company performance, market demand and even investor sentiment. Here’s how to read a stock quote page and what each element means. First, let’s take a few steps back and understand what a stock actually represents. When you own a share of a stock, you have partial ownership of the company. Companies issue shares when they need to raise more money to grow. Because of this, a stock not only represents the current value of the business, but also what the company could be worth down the line. Stocks are usually part of an investor’s broader portfolio, which is a collection of investments, including bonds and other assets. Let’s look at what each element of a stock quote page indicates and how it can help you decide whether to invest in a company. The ticker symbol is a set of letters assigned to the company that help identify the stock. It’s usually two to four letters and often reflects the company’s name, which you’ll usually find placed above the ticker symbol. For example, Apple’s ticker is AAPL. The quoted price is the number that appears underneath the ticker symbol and represents the last traded price that someone paid for the stock. In other words, it’s a quick snapshot of the stock’s current market value. The opening price represents the first trade price recorded for that market day. Investors usually compare the opening price to the current price or closing price to determine how much it has increased or decreased throughout the day. The closing price is the last price the stock traded for in the previous trading session. Both opening and closing prices are almost always included at the bottom of the stock quote page no matter what investment platform you’re using. The bid price is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for the stock. The ask price is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. These numbers are usually displayed somewhere near the quoted price, or at the bottom of the stock quote page near other important information and financial ratios. This number is the difference between the bid price and the ask, showing investors a snapshot of demand and how liquid the stock is. A narrow spread typically indicates greater liquidity, while a wider spread suggests the opposite. Some platforms show this number, while others do not. To calculate it yourself, take the ask price and subtract the bid price.                   ",

Leisure facilities companies often sell experiences rather than tangible products, and in the last decade-plus, consumers have slowly shifted their spending from \"things\" to \"experiences\". Leisure facilities seek to benefit but must innovate to do so because of the industry's high competition and capital intensity. A company’s long-term performance can indicate its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Luckily, Bowlero’s sales grew at an incredible 72.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last four years. This is a useful starting point for our analysis. We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. Bowlero’s recent history shows its demand slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 11.2% over the last two years is well below its four-year trend. Note that COVID hurt Bowlero’s business in 2020 and part of 2021, and it bounced back in a big way thereafter. Bowlero also reports same-store sales, which show how much revenue its established locations generate. Over the last two years, Bowlero’s same-store sales averaged 5.4% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the opening of new locations is boosting the company’s top-line performance.          ",

Shares of the company, which are down about 53% this year, rose over 5% in extended trading. Dreiling also relinquished his position as chairman, and Lead Independent Director Edward Kelly has been elected to take on the role. Dreiling decided to step away as his health presented some new challenges over the past two months, a company statement said. The company said it was scouting for a permanent CEO, from among internal and external candidates. Dollar Tree also reiterated its forecast for the third quarter and said it was committed to complete the review of strategic options, which included a potential sale or spin off of its Family Dollar segment. Discount retailers like Dollar Tree and Dollar General (DG) are facing stiff competition from retailers including Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and PDD Holding's (PDD) e-commerce platform Temu as they keep prices low to attract cost-conscious consumers. Earlier this year, Dollar Tree had outlined plans to shutter 970 Family Dollar stores and as of Aug. 3, it shuttered about 655 stores and said in September that it would close 45 stores through the remainder of the year.

The stock traded within an ascending triangle between July and October before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline late last month. Investors should watch important support levels on Apple's chart around $218, $198, and $181, while monitoring key overhead areas near $233 and $270.  Apple (AAPL) shares are in the spotlight Monday following news over the weekend that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B) has continued trimming its stake in the tech giant. Last week, Apple shares came under pressure after the company provided soft current-quarter revenue guidance, prompting concerns about a slow iPhone 16 upgrade cycle amid the delayed rollout of the company’s highly anticipated Apple Intelligence that it initially announced in June. The iPhone maker’s stock could also face scrutiny after Berkshire Hathaway reported on Saturday that it had offloaded about 100 million shares, or around 25% of its holding, in Apple during the third quarter. However, the tech behemoth remains the conglomerate’s largest stock position, with a market value of $69.9 billion as of Sept. 30. Apple shares were down 0.9% at around $221 in midday trading Monday. Below, we navigate Apple’s chart using technical analysis to identify important price levels worth watching out for. Apple shares traded within an ascending triangle between July and October before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline late last month following the company's quarterly results. Importantly, the recent move lower has occurred on increasing volume, indicating a rise in selling pressure among market participants. Let’s point out three important support levels on Apple’s chart and also identify key overhead areas to monitor if the stock resumes its longer-term uptrend. Firstly, it’s worth monitoring how the price responds to the $218 level, a location on the chart that may attract buying interest near the June peak, which also closely aligns with troughs in July and September. A decisive breakdown below this level could see the shares decline to around $198, where they may encounter support near a trendline joining a range of peaks on the chart between July and September last year with the 2024 August swing low. Further selling opens the door for a fall to lower support at the $181 level. Buy-and-hold investors may look for entry points around this area near a horizontal line linking a series of comparable trading levels on the chart from June last year to May this year.     ",

The decision came after franchises appreciated nearly 40x over the past 30 years and reached $5.93 billion on average, according to Sportico’s calculations. But NFL team values still have a long runway, according to one team owner. “These funds can get liquid in six years,” Jonathan Kraft, New England Patriots president, said at Sportico’s Invest in Sports Event at Nasdaq. “You probably won’t get 3-4x your money, but my guess is you’re going to get returns that beat the stock market over that period and without taking that much more risk.” More from Sportico.com Industry Convenes at Nasdaq for Sportico's 'Invest in Sports' Fox Sells Out Super Bowl LIX, With Ads Fetching Over $7 Million a Pop Sportico Brings Industry Leaders to Invest in Sports New York Kraft then joked that he is not an investment advisor, in case “the SEC is listening.” The August decision approved a handful of PE firms to buy up to 10% of individual teams. No single fund can invest in more than six teams, and the minimum hold period for each investment is six years. Kraft sees a future where the PE firms will all raise follow-on funds, and “they’ll just be rolling it.” Kraft highlighted the NFL’s international opportunity from a media standpoint as it expands to a potential 16 games that can carve out another TV package. Kraft and his father, Robert, have made the Patriots one of the NFL’s most successful clubs on and off the field. Robert Kraft paid a then-record $172 million in 1994 for the team. The Patriots have made 10 Super Bowls under Kraft ownership and won six titles. In August, Sportico valued the Patriots at $7.31 billion. Opening up NFL ownership has created potential liquidity for limited partnership stakes in the NFL. LP stakes have traditionally sold at a 20-30% discount to control transactions, but Jonathan Kraft sees a world where LP stakes sell at par or even premium to control deals. “Something that used to be completely illiquid and not something most family offices would look to play, and it has been completely flipped on its head,” Kraft said. Yet, Kraft highlighted the one big economic advantage with control ownership in sports team sales that historically has justified the premium. “Uncle Sam becomes your partner in buying the asset,” Kraft said based on the idea that current tax laws allow you to offset income in other businesses through depreciation rules.

        "body": "U.S. mortgage rates rose for a fourth consecutive week, climbing as housing demand waned. Despite recent expectations of relief from anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, borrowing costs have continued to rise. Freddie Mac reported that the average rate of a 30-year fixed mortgage hit 6.54% by Oct. 24, 2024, a peak unseen since August. Although still below this year's high of 7.22% from May, the upward trend has started to weigh on homebuyers.

Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. The anticipated rate cut by the Fed brought mortgage rates to a low of 6.08% in September, yet this temporary dip failed to ignite the housing market. Sales of previously owned homes, which dominate the market, slipped 1% in September from the prior month, bringing the annual adjusted rate down to 3.84 million homes sold, the lowest since 2010, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Mortgage applications also declined, with a separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showing a four-week dip, reaching a level not seen since July. Experts suggest that the rate dip might have come too late in the season for most buyers, who typically enter the market in spring when families can more easily plan around the school year. Some buyers may also hold out, hoping that rates might drop even further since the Fed has signaled plans to continue adjusting rates through 2025. For buyers, each small uptick in rates raises monthly payments, adding to the burden of high home prices, which in September rose for the 15th straight month, according to NAR data. Increased home insurance costs are also stretching family budgets. See Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Analysts attribute the recent rise in mortgage rates to strong economic data rather than Fed policy. While mortgage rates are linked to the 10-year Treasury yield, which many expected to fall with anticipated Fed rate cuts, stronger-than-expected economic performance has driven yields up. For instance, September job growth exceeded forecasts, and recent retail spending reports indicate steady consumer demand, bolstering investor expectations and nudging bond yields upward.

It's likely that unemployment will pick back up in future job reports, Clark added. The Federal Reserve isn't finished with aggressive interest rate cuts this year, a Citi economist said on Monday. According to Veronica Clark, deteriorating labor dynamics will force the central bank to cut rates by 50 basis points in December. \"We see this weakening labor market dynamic across a number of different data points: low hiring rate, low quit rates, new hours worked coming down,\" she told Bloomberg TV. \"This does feel like labor demand that is pretty soft.\" Her point has grown more evident after October's jobs report underwhelmed expectations with only 12,000 jobs added. Though hurricanes and industry strikes made last month's data an anomaly, October's weakness pairs with a broader labor-market weakening. Clark cited that big downward payroll revisions continue to undercut economists' understanding of how strong the jobs market really is. \"We did get preliminary estimates of the benchmark revisions a couple of months ago. That implies payrolls are overstated by about 70k right now,\" she said. Clark's outlook runs counter to the consensus on Wall Street that the Fed will roll out a slow and steady easing cycle. A strong September jobs report that saw a surprise unemployment decline, as well as moderating inflation, have given investors confidence that the economy has room to cut rates. But Clark suggested that the jobless rate is unlikely to remain at 4.1% for long. Though October's unemployment rate stayed unchanged on a rounded basis, Clark noted that it was it nearly rounded to 4.2%. \"I do think this is kind of confirming that that drop in September doesn't necessarily repeat,\" she said, and added: \"When you have such weak hiring, you would be inclined to think people will just stay unemployed for longer, and there's that upward pressure on unemployment still.\" Clark expects that the Fed will lower rates by a quarter-point at its policy meeting on Thursday, as do a vast majority of investors. However, no investor has yet priced in a half-point cut the following month, as Citi suggests will happen. Instead, CME FedWatch Tool data shows 82.8% odds of another quarter-point cut in December.

Over the last seven years, financial performance and most notably a company's stock price have become a stronger predictor of a chief executive's ability to hold onto the job, research group The Conference Board found in its \"CEO Succession Practices in the Russell 3000 and S&P 500: 2024 Edition\" report. The latest figures show 42% of S&P 500 companies that replaced their top executive this year had stock returns in the bottom quartile of their industry. The number is even higher among Russell 3000 companies, the index that tracks the largest 3,000 U.S. companies, with 45% of companies that replaced CEOs this year posting shareholder returns within the 25th percentile. In 2017, only 30% of S&P 500 companies that replaced CEOs had a shareholder return in the bottom quartile, while it was 29% at Russell 3000 companies, the Conference Board data show. \"Corporate boards are clearly becoming less patient with underperformers,\" said Blair Jones, managing director at executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy, who co-authored the report. A board's sense of urgency for making sure the right person is leading a company has increased dramatically since the pandemic as external factors like supply chain disruptions and geopolitical drama are no longer seen as excuses for poor returns, the report's authors said. More notably, fresh investor scrutiny, including from corporate activists who routinely issue demands for change in the executive suite, is linking a poor stock price with a CEO's tenure, the report's authors said. \"Boards often want to get ahead of any activist who may make changing the CEO one of their first requests,\" Jones added. In the last few months, U.S. companies Starbucks and Bloomin' Brands changed CEOs and Swiss multinational Nestle replaced its CEO. Activists pushed for CEO changes at Southwest Airlines, where Bob Jordan kept his job, and are pressing Air Products and Chemicals' board to lay out a succession plan for its octogenarian CEO. Even as boards are now quicker to throw out CEOs at underperforming companies, the report found that boards have stuck with traditional recruiting patterns. They prefer company veterans who are well-versed in the corporate culture, have shown loyalty to the organization and could move into the job with minimal disruption.     ",

Of the 12 analysts polled by Visible Alpha, nine have a \"buy\" or equivalent rating, compared with two maintaining \"hold\" ratings and one with a \"sell.\" The consensus price target is $138, less than a dollar above the stock's Monday close. Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri made a bull case for the company in September, setting a $160 price target for Arm and calling it “well-positioned to benefit from rapid growth of GenAI in the cloud and at the edge.” Pajjuri said that edge AI—essentially the use of AI on local devices—was “a key catalyst” for Arm’s Armv9 architecture, which is used in the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 16's processor.

Our record quarterly net income of $11.2 million represents 25% of sales, and our Adjusted EBITDA was $12.3 million for Q1 and equates to a 28% EBITDA margin. Our cellular (radio) communication device sales increased 93% compared to Q1 last year and represent 70% of our Intrusion and Access Alarm product sales. In addition, radio sales for Q1 increased 23% sequentially and represent the highest level of radio sales since Q3 of fiscal 2023, which was the last quarter positively affected by the Verizon 3G sunset. While robust radio sales do have a negative impact on our overall equipment gross margins, which was 24% for Q1 compared to 28% in last year's first quarter, strong radio sales ultimately leads to increases in our recurring revenue business. Overall, our equipment revenue decreased 6% for the quarter, which partially was a result of a decrease in our door locking sales, which decreased 8% compared to last year. Locking products represents approximately 60% of our equipment revenues and the decline was primarily attributable to several locking distributors' efforts to lower their inventory levels. Our RSR increased 22% to $21.1 million and generated a gross margin of 91%, which was an improvement on last year's RSR margin of 90%. RSR represents 48% of total revenue in Q1 and our overall gross margin improved by over 200 basis points to 55.9% compared to 53.8% last year.\" Napco Security Technologies, Inc.

Founded in 1991, Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) specializes in refrigerant services and solutions, providing refrigerant sales, reclamation, and recycling. Historically, specialty equipment distributors have boasted deep selection and expertise in sometimes narrow areas like single-use packaging or unique lighting equipment. Additionally, the industry has evolved to include more automated industrial equipment and machinery over the last decade, driving efficiencies and enabling valuable data collection. Specialty equipment distributors whose offerings keep up with these trends can take share in a still-fragmented market, but like the broader industrials sector, this space is at the whim of economic cycles that impact the capital spending and manufacturing propelling industry volumes. Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul.

        "body": "Luxury isn’t merely a product; it’s a statement of lifestyle, a mark of status, and a testament to refined taste. Beyond the world of fashion, handbags, jewellery, and cosmetics, luxury today also encompasses experiences, art, real estate, and more. It represents an indulgence in life’s finer things—a pursuit of quality, craftsmanship, and exclusivity that speaks to discerning consumers around the globe. In 2024, however, the luxury sector faces an increasingly challenging environment. Economic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, and inflationary pressures are mounting, casting a shadow over what has historically been a resilient market. As these headwinds gain strength, investors are more discerning, focusing on which French luxury stocks can withstand the storm and potentially emerge stronger. Are all French luxury stocks equally prepared to navigate these challenges? And how can investors make informed decisions amid these shifting market dynamics? China, a crucial driver of luxury demand, is experiencing a notable slowdown in growth. In the third quarter of 2024, China’s GDP grew by just 4.6%, falling short of the government’s 5% target and marking a decline from the previous quarter. Across the first three quarters of 2024, China’s economic growth averaged 4.8% year-over-year, revealing a gradual deceleration. Recent data has shown slight signs of stabilisation, with the Chinese Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) reaching 50.1 in October—its first expansionary figure since April. Similarly, the non-manufacturing PMI rose to 50.2, indicating a mild improvement in services. While these metrics suggest a potential uptick in economic activity, challenges remain for China, particularly in its real estate sector, which has long been a cornerstone of its economy. The property market’s ongoing struggles have created a ripple effect, impacting construction, manufacturing, and consumer spending. Weakening consumer and business confidence adds further pressure on the broader economy. To combat these economic challenges, the Chinese government has introduced various stimulus measures, including increased fiscal spending. An upcoming parliamentary meeting (November 4th–8th) may reveal further details of these plans. In 2023, a similar meeting led to an increase in China’s fiscal deficit from 3% to 3.8%, underscoring the government’s commitment to economic support. China’s economic health is of particular interest to the global luxury industry. In 2021, Chinese consumers accounted for over 35% of worldwide luxury sales, a figure expected to rise to 45% by 2030 according to Luxonomy’s forecasts. This year alone, Chinese spending on luxury goods is projected to approach €120 billion, a 33% increase from two years ago according to Mordor Intelligence. However, as China grapples with economic headwinds, there’s growing uncertainty about how this will affect its luxury spending.                            ",

European stock pickers returned a negative 2.6% in October, their largest monthly loss since September 2023, Goldman Sachs said. The region's broadest index of European stocks fell 3.6% in October during the third-quarter earnings season, which has seen positive results from banks, pharmaceuticals and biotech companies offset by a drag from industrials and energy companies. European stocks were sold broadly by all market participants, as global traders dumped their European holdings in favour of hoovering up U.S. equities ahead of the presidential elections, the note said. Declining stock values in Europe knocked year-to-date returns for European traders down to 5%, less than half the 11.5% posted by U.S. stock pickers. Losses mostly resulted from utilities stocks like gas, electric and water companies, Goldman said. Industrial stocks and short positions, which bet on a fall in the value of a company's shares, made money for some of the hedge funds, it added. Stocks that experienced the biggest net selling were from hardware tech like semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies, as well as the aerospace and defence sectors, the bank said. Financial stocks, which typically include banks, were the most net-bought sector for a second month in a row, with hedge funds ditching short positions and adding long positions which bet on a rise in value, Goldman said, without giving a further breakdown. European-focused fundamental stock pickers \"substantially\" decreased gross leverage in October, the bank said, while net leverage hit its lowest this year.

        "body": "By Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Donald Trump is a clear favorite to beat Kamala Harris - that's if you put your faith in prediction markets, the latest frontier for the indefatigable crypto speculator. On the eve of the U.S. election, billions of crypto dollars are chasing bets on the two candidates on platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi. Those sites respectively gave Trump about a 57%-43% and 51%-49% lead over Harris as of Monday, in contrast to neck-and neck opinion polls. Polymarket, the busiest of these platforms, which have largely sprung up over the past five years, has seen about $3.1 billion in trading volume on wagers on the winner of the presidential vote. Kalshi, a U.S. CFTC-regulated site, has seen nearly $197 million in trading on its election outcome contract. Its second-largest betting contract, on the electoral college margin, has drawn $33.8 million. Participants and watchers are divided over whether such markets, where prices offered are shaped by the weight of bets, are a robust leading indicator or are distorted by large bets and reflect the views of a niche crypto club. Elon Musk, for one, has said betting markets are \"more accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line\" and mainstream news sites are citing their odds. Many people aren't convinced, though. \"Your average voter isn't spending time or money on prediction markets – those platforms are being dominated by crypto-native users, and those users are voting for Trump,\" said Michael Cahill, CEO of Web3-focused developer Douro Labs. The pricing on these sites reflects the assumed probability of the outcome. On Polymarket, for example, a wager betting on a Trump win costs about $0.58 versus $0.42 for Harris. The buyer of the winning horse receives $1 per contract. A Kalshi spokesperson said all traders are all vetted, and trades are capped at $7 million for people and $100 million for eligible contract participants. Crypto exchange dYdX, meanwhile, allows more complex leveraged betting on both a Trump and Harris win via perpetual futures linked to Polymarket's odds. 'BIG TEST' AFTER U.S. ELECTION Adam McCarthy, research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko, said that the headline figure of Polymarket bets on the election didn't equate to the amount of money that was currently still at stake because it also included inactive bets on former candidates like Nikki Haley and RFK Jr. \"That $2 billion cumulative headline figure looks impressive and obviously for a brand new platform it is, but that doesn't reflect active markets entirely,\" McCarthy added.

Listen and follow The Big Take daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen Electoral betting is legal for the first time in modern-day US on the platform Kalshi, and wagers worth hundreds of millions of dollars have piled up on it and Polymarket, a crypto-based offshore exchange. In theory, this means these markets are more liquid than ever. And, therefore, the conclusion they’ve been broadcasting for the past month — that Donald Trump is, to one degree or another, the clear favorite over Kamala Harris — should be seen as more telling than a few notable misfires in recent years, such as the Brexit referendum and 2016’s presidential election. Again, in theory. Yet even some supporters of these platforms fret that too much faith — among the Trump camp and up and down Wall Street — is being put in their prophetic virtues. “I’m a bit worried,” said Rajiv Sethi, an economist at Barnard College, Columbia University, who supported Kalshi in its successful effort to overturn a ban on the use of derivatives to wager on the election. As much as markets likes Polymarket have grown, he said, they’re still places where a handful of deep-pocketed investors can plunk down large bets and distort the odds — in Trump’s favor, in this case. “There’s no reason why somehow the price that emerges from their activity with each other is going to generate an accurate forecast,” said Sethi. Over the last few days, Harris’s chances have risen in the betting markets as polls released over the weekend indicated she was gaining ground. Most notably she overtook Trump on PredictIt, an inherently limited market hosted by a university in New Zealand. The prevailing wisdom on Wall Street is that prediction markets have an edge over polls because participants are economically motivated to incorporate every drip of new information faster. Between a single forecasting model and the wisdom of a crowd that has digested all that information, “I’m going to go with that bigger aggregation of people,” said Eric Zitzewitz, an economics professor at Dartmouth College. “People have fairly strong incentives to do careful analysis.”                      ",

Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Profits at onshore-listed companies increased 3.7% from a year ago after declining in the previous two quarters, according to an analysis by China Merchants Securities Co. The improvement was largely driven by a surge in investment returns at financial firms following a stock market rally that began in late September, the brokerage said. Beyond the financial sector, profits declined at a steeper pace in the latest quarter. The mixed outcome shows Beijing needs to act forcefully to spur an earnings turnaround. While the stimulus drive — which kicked off at the end of the third quarter — may filter through to corporate performance in the months to come, analysts say the boost may be limited unless policies address weak domestic demand. The onus is now on China’s top leaders to deliver on fiscal stimulus promises at this week’s meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. “The stimulus blitz at the end of September has provided limited support for China’s earnings, and any impact will be reflected in fourth-quarter results at the soonest,” said Shen Meng, a director at Chanson & Co. “The policies, which focus more on providing liquidity, won’t be able to help companies improve their earnings unless Beijing rolls out measures to tackle structural economic issues.” China Merchants Securities’ analysis is in line with that from UBS Securities, which shows insurance and brokers on the mainland reported 233% profit growth in the third quarter from a year earlier. Meanwhile, non-financial earnings dropped 9%, weaker than the 7% slide in the previous quarter. The CSI 300 Index, an onshore benchmark, surged nearly 35% from a September low through to Oct. 8 as China’s central bank announced a broad package of measures that included an interest-rate cut and liquidity support for the equity market. It has since fallen more than 7%. Among this season’s standouts, China Life Insurance Co. said net income surged 174% in the first nine months of the year as the equities rally bolstered investment returns.

Adding to the potential for volatility, the Federal Reserve will also be meeting on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time. The futures for the S&P 500 and for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were 0.1% higher. In early European trading, Germany's DAX edged 0.1% lower to 19,125.18 while the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.2% to 7,356.02. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.1% at 8,179.73. Share prices surged on Chinese markets as investors anticipated moves by Beijing to boost the world’s second-largest economy during a meeting of the Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.1% to 21,006.97, while the Shanghai Composite index surged 2.3% to 3,386.99. Officials are expected to endorse major spending initiatives to boost economic growth amid troubles for the country’s real-estate industry. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the lawmakers had reviewed legislation to raise ceilings on local government debt to replace existing hidden debts, part of a plan announced earlier to arrange debt swaps to help resolve the financial woes brought on by the pandemic and by a collapse in the property market in recent years. So far, no specific amount of funding for such efforts has been announced. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.1% to 38,474.90, reopening after a holiday on Monday. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.4% to 2,576,88 after the country's military said North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern sea, continuing its weapons demonstrations ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The S&P/ASX 200 in Australia dropped 0.4% to 8,131.80 as the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged. On Monday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, remaining near its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. The hope that’s propelled U.S. stock indexes to records recently is that the U.S. economy can remain resilient and avoid a long-feared recession, in part because of the coming cuts to rates expected from the Fed.

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Muddling the Message Around ‘Climate Havens’ A win for Donald Trump together with a Republican sweep of Congress followed by limited moves in the 10-year Treasury yield on expectations of improving economic growth would be positive for equities, according to a Morgan Stanley team led by Michael Wilson. In that case, cyclical stocks such as financials and industrials would outperform, they wrote in a note. If yields move “materially” higher due to concerns over the fiscal outlook, however, stock markets would see a risk-off move, with tariff-sensitive consumer stocks losing ground, they said. Treasury yields fell on Monday as polling data ahead of Tuesday’s US elections prompted some investors to pare the so-called Trump trades. Polls show Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Trump are in a close race, with Harris having a slight edge nationally and in some swing states. If Harris wins the White House and Congress is divided, tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables could outperform in the short term, the Morgan Stanley team wrote. In such a scenario, a fall in rates could also benefit housing-sensitive consumer stocks while financials, industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform. Mislav Matejka’s team at JPMorgan is also telling stock investors to keep a close eye at the bond market. Investor positioning in equities is higher than in 2016, the strategists wrote, with a Trump win and positive market reaction widely expected. “While equities could have a knee-jerk bounce on a Trump win, in sympathy with the 2016 template, the sustainability of the up move is likely to depend on the magnitude of the bond yields’ response,” the strategists wrote in a note. If Harris wins, uncertainty over the path of corporate taxes would increase near term, though in the medium term equities might find support from the reduced risk of tariffs, they said.

Investors will have little time to rest after the vote, with the Fed's policy meeting starting Wednesday. US stocks traded lower on Monday as investors turned their attention to the presidential election on Tuesday. More than 76 million Americans have voted via mail-in ballots or early in person, suggesting a potential record turnout this year. After a shock Iowa poll showed Kamala Harris leading in the state against Donald Trump over the weekend, betting odds tightened in the race after Trump spent the weeks leading up to the vote far ahead of Harris. Harris' momentum in the election's final days weighed on the Trump trade on Monday, with Treasury yields, the US dollar, and bitcoin all falling. For a full rundown of the implications for the economy and stock market based on who wins the election, read BI's deep dive on the potential impacts here. Analysts from Citi on Monday noted that the stock market isn't behaving like it has in past election years. Stocks tend to waver amid the uncertainty, but the rally has largely continued in the months leading to the vote, suggesting that investors are more attuned to macroeconomic data and earnings. \"US equities have been very strong coming into this election cycle compared to the past,\" the analysts said. \"The current anomaly has less to do with the market pricing a certain election outcome but more to do with an expectation of continued interest rate cutting combined with a likely shallower US economic slowdown. After the election, investors will shift their attention to the Federal Reserve. The central bank's next policy meeting is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, with an interest rate decision to come at 2 p.m. ET Thursday. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets see a 96% chance of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points.

Also, sales came in roughly in line during the quarter, unexciting, and not enough for the market. Given the company's recent AI bets and potential in the SMB space, expectations were likely high, heading into earnings. However, the company provided some encouraging updates, announcing the early availability of its first GenAI Platform. Overall, this quarter was mixed, with the guidance weighing on shares. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy DigitalOcean? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. DigitalOcean’s shares are very volatile and have had 22 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for DigitalOcean and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 14.6% on the news that the company reported fourth quarter results and delivered very solid free cash flow. In addition, its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street's estimates while EPS beat by a more convincing margin. On the other hand, gross margin decreased. Looking ahead, revenue guidance for the next quarter and full year came in roughly in line with expectations. Having experienced macro challenges in 2023, management provided a more encouraging outlook on the business environment adding, \"While top line pressure lasted longer into 2023 than we had originally expected, we saw a bottoming of the headwinds in Q3, and with stable net dollar retention (a measure of customer revenue retention over time) and steady growth in Cloudways (managed cloud computing service) in the second half, we exceeded the revised full year revenue outlook.\" Zooming out, this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track. DigitalOcean is down 0.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $35.92 per share, it is trading 18.4% below its 52-week high of $44 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of DigitalOcean’s shares at the IPO in March 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $845.76.

        "body": "Good morning. As voters choose the next U.S. president, there’s a question of how the markets will react to the results. Analysts in the banking sector are weighing in. A report released on Nov. 1 by J.P. Morgan Wealth Management notes that following an election, volatility in the stock market may be elevated. However, since 1984 there’s only been one election year where the market was lower 12 months after the election—in 2000, when the equity markets were grappling with the bursting of the tech bubble. “The Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 tech sector sold off by double digits, while other sector declines were much more muted or in some cases produced gains,” Alan Wynne, a global investment strategist, writes. For capital markets to be significantly impacted, we would likely need a decisive outcome, “meaning a sweep of the Presidency and both houses of Congress,” Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management states in an Oct. 29 report. Without one-party control, it’s difficult for \"the most significant policy proposals to take effect,\" he explains, \"and that’s when markets might become more reactive.” However, it's possible that the election winner’s broad policy initiatives could have some capital market impact at the sector level. For example, “if Republicans win, there is likely to be more of a push for development of fossil fuels, while a Democratic win might further promote renewable energy development,” according to Haworth. A recent edition of Goldman Sachs’s “Top of Mind” report states that: \"Uncertainty around the U.S. election remains high, and we continue to think the outcome could have important implications, especially around trade, immigration, and fiscal policy.\" The in-depth analysis compares the positions of Vice President Harris and Former President Trump on the federal corporate tax rate and tariffs, among other issues. There’s also a section where analysts discuss the implications of potential policy changes on the sectors they cover. The banking sector, a bellwether for how the economy is doing, would be one to watch. Richard Ramsden of Goldman Sachs Equity Research writes: “The vast majority of bank earnings are domestic, and banks have fewer deductions than other sectors, which leaves bank earnings more sensitive to changes in the headline corporate tax rate than the average S&P 500 sector.” Some experts think it's a win-win situation for the market no matter who is elected president. A survey conducted by Bloomberg finds that about half of investors think the stock market will maintain its pace or accelerate under a Harris presidency, while 59% believe the same under a Trump presidency. The survey of 350 respondents made up of economists, portfolio managers and investors believe certain asset classes will boom under either candidate.      ",

Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Traders are taking a cautious approach after one of the most tumultuous and dramatic presidential campaigns in modern history. With polls suggesting a photo-finish result, the likelihood of a disputed result means that the vote count could eventually drag on for days or even weeks. US stock futures rose slightly, with Nasdaq 100 contracts adding 0.2%. Palantir Technologies Inc. surged 13% in premarket trading on record profit and high demand for its artificial intelligence software. The dollar was steady, while 10-year Treasury yields advanced two basis points to 4.30%. “What you can see across markets now is that no one is ready to take clear investment positions on the election,” said Alexandre Hezez, chief investment officer at Groupe Banque Richelieu in Paris. “The uncertainty is palpable across all asset classes. There’s such a massive gap between the program of the two candidates that caution is of the essence.” Boeing Co. gained 2.2% in early trading after workers voted to end a strike that’s crippled jetliner production for 53 days. S&P 500 futures edged higher 0.1%. In Europe, the benchmark Stoxx 600 was little changed, with volumes tracking about two-thirds of the 20-day average. The closeness of the US presidential and the prospect of a drawn-out count are spurring investors to brace for a potential rise in volatility. Options data suggests stock traders are pricing in a 1.8% move in either direction for the S&P 500 on Wednesday, according to Citigroup’s head of equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser. The swings will likely be most obvious in individual stocks and sectors, as has been the case so far this election season. “A tough count will increase uncertainty on the markets, a scenario that produces not many winners,” said Guillermo Hernandez Sampere, head of trading at asset manager MPPM. Some hedge funds are favoring currency options that will gain from a weaker dollar should Harris win the presidency. Close polling in especially Iowa jolted leveraged funds to re-evaluate who will emerge victorious, with some unwinding bullish greenback bets on Monday.

The analyst raised Peloton's rating from Underperform (Sell) to Buy and increased the price target from $3.7 to $9, as the announcement of a new CEO raised the hopes of a turnaround. Following its Q3 2024 (Fiscal Q1 2025) earnings, Peloton named Peter Stern, who served as president of Ford Integrated Services, as CEO. Nagle thinks Peter Stern's relevant experience in subscription, hardware & health tech can help drive subscription improvements. The analyst also sees the potential for cost optimization, which could result in the company reporting north of $300 million in annual EBITDA in the near term. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $7.59, up 4.6% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Peloton? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Peloton’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 63 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock gained 20.9% on the news that private equity firms were considering a buyout of the company. According to sources, there are discussions about cutting Peloton's operating expenses to make a potential acquisition more attractive. On May 2, 2024, Peloton announced cost optimization initiatives to reduce annual run-rate expenses by more than $200m by the end of FY'25. The plan includes reducing its global headcount by approximately 15% (400 Peloton team members). Following the announcement of the cost optimization initiatives, Barry McCarthy stepped down from his roles as CEO, President and Board Director, providing more of an opening for potential buyers as the board continues to search for his replacement. Peloton is up 30.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $7.59 per share, it is still trading 10.8% below its 52-week high of $8.50 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Peloton’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $308.21. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

While we experienced some strength against our expectations in the Communication Infrastructure, Mobile and Automotive end markets, we were confronted with increasing macro related weakness in the Industrial & IoT market.

Spun off from Dutch electronics giant Philips in 2006, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) is a designer and manufacturer of chips used in autos, industrial manufacturing, mobile devices, and communications infrastructure. Demand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years.          ",

Net fund flows of Hong Kong's exchange-traded product (ETP) market, which includes ETFs and leveraged and inverse products, surged 48 per cent year on year to HK$46.7 billion in the first 10 months, according to HKEX data. That brought the ETP market's total assets under management (AUM) to nearly HK$500 billion. Average daily ETF turnover on the Hong Kong stock exchange hit a record high of HK$77 billion (US$9.9 billion) on October 8, riding on the stock market rally since Beijing unleashed its boldest stimulus package to end the property slump and put a floor on equities on September 24.

The markets have been volatile as investors await more fiscal stimulus moves and observe the implementation of the measures in China. \"At times of volatility, investors tend to gravitate towards ETFs because maybe they don't have time to do stock picking, and they want to quickly react to market developments, market news and market movement, so they transact using ETFs,\" said Jean-Francois Mesnard-Sense, head of exchange-traded products at bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX). He added that ETFs accounted for more than 15 per cent of the overall cash market trading volume during the recent spike. ETFs - funds that pool together a basket of securities and aim to offer returns that mirror the underlying market - are gaining traction in Asia, with mainland China being one of the fastest-growing markets.

Founded in 1987, 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT) provides software for organizations to efficiently communicate and collaborate with their customers, employees, and partners. Work is becoming more distributed, both across geographies and devices. In order for businesses to keep functioning efficiently, they need to be able to communicate as well as they did when the teams were co-located, which drives the demand for integrated communication platforms. A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall business quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Unfortunately, 8x8’s 7.4% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was weak. This shows it failed to expand in any major way, a rough starting point for our analysis. This quarter, 8x8’s revenue fell 2.2% year on year to $181 million but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 1.5%. Management is currently guiding for a 4.7% year-on-year decline next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. This projection is underwhelming and illustrates the market believes its products and services will see some demand headwinds.        ",

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose on 8 of the 10 election days the stock market has been open since 1980. If we include both the day of and the day after the election combined, the index has been a bit more fussy, falling half of the time. A similar story has played out for the month. The S&P 500 has fallen in 5 of the past 10 election Novembers. But zoom out, and the story improves. The S&P 500 has been up an average of 10.68% in the year following elections dating back to 1960. That's right in line with the standard average return for the S&P 500 over time. It's one of many signs that while the election could very well bring some turbulence to markets over the next few days, particularly if there isn't a clear winner, it rarely halts the long-term trend. \"We remain mindful that while elections usually spark short-term repricings, the S&P 500 tends to post gains in all balance-of-power scenarios,\" RBC Capital Markets' Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. Essentially, elections are no different than other risks to the market, like tensions in the Middle East, natural disasters, or worker strikes. The key question remains what any risk could mean for future company earnings. And for elections, that means potential policies that could alter the corporate operating environment. Typically that means a split-party government, where fewer sweeping changes are passed, is the ideal backdrop for stocks. \"Checks and balances as a result of differences of opinion at the Congressional level (sometimes dramatically termed 'gridlock') often have served in the past ... to protect what investors care most about — a healthy economy for consumers and for revenue and profit growth for business,\" Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus wrote in a note to clients on Monday morning. Analyzing the past few presidential cycles furthers this point. Research from Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner shows the S&P 500 grew at an annualized rate of 13% from the day President Barack Obama was elected to the night Donald Trump was elected. From the day of the Trump win to when Joe Biden won in 2020, the index grew at an annualized rate of 14%.         ",

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Muddling the Message Around ‘Climate Havens’ As the race remained neck-and-neck in the runup to Tuesday’s vote, investors were positioning for the fallout of a victory by Donald Trump, whose tariff and tax plans would likely curb imports and put upward pressure on US interest rates. Those bets could be seen getting pared in early Monday trading, with the latest polls casting more doubt on Trump’s odds of victory. In recent weeks, hedge funds had been stepping up bets against the Mexican peso, sending it sliding to the lowest this year. The Chinese yuan slipped, too, as the dollar staged its biggest advance in over two years. Investors yanked money out of funds focused on developing countries’ bonds and around the world, and emerging-market stocks just had their worst monthly loss since January. The price movements show the high stakes across emerging markets, which is leaving them primed for another round of selling or a rapid rebound if Vice President Kamala Harris is handed a victory at the polls. In “an election that is a complete toss up, it is very difficult to take active currency bets,” said Arif Joshi, co-head of emerging-market debt at Lazard Asset Management, who said markets are pricing in some of the risks of voters returning Trump to the White House. That suggests a Harris win would be “a structural bullish move for emerging markets.” Hints of that emerged on Monday, with the currencies of Brazil, Poland and Mexico among the biggest gainers as investors recalibrated their bets after some polls shifted toward Harris. Trump would likely alter the status quo far more significantly than Harris, a former US senator who has served as President Joe Biden’s vice president for the past four years. In emerging markets, the main risk stems from Trump’s plan to enact tariffs, which would weaken their exports and demand for their currencies. Trump has also cast doubt on the US’s commitment to alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to Ukraine’s efforts to defeat Russia’s invasion. That has weighed on local bonds of some eastern European countries and pushed up Ukraine’s dollar debt on wagers that Trump’s election may push it to cut a ceasefire deal with Russia.

Casino operators enjoy limited competition because gambling is a highly regulated industry. These companies can also enjoy healthy margins and profits. Have you ever heard the phrase ‘the house always wins’? Regulation cuts both ways, however, and casinos may face stroke-of-the-pen risk that suddenly limits what they can or can't do and where they can do it. Furthermore, digitization is changing the game, pun intended. Whether it’s online poker or sports betting on your smartphone, innovation is forcing these players to adapt to changing consumer preferences, such as being able to wager anywhere on demand. Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Wynn Resorts grew its sales at a weak 1.4% compounded annual growth rate. This shows it failed to expand in any major way, a rough starting point for our analysis. We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. Wynn Resorts’s annualized revenue growth of 36.9% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand recently accelerated. Note that COVID hurt Wynn Resorts’s business in 2020 and part of 2021, and it bounced back in a big way thereafter. We can dig further into the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Casino, Hotel, and Dining and Entertainment, which are 60.2%, 16.8%, and 15.5% of revenue. Over the last two years, Wynn Resorts’s revenues in all three segments increased. Its Casino revenue (Poker, slots) averaged year-on-year growth of 72% while its Hotel (overnight bookings) and Dining and Entertainment (food, beverage, Wynn Interactive) revenues averaged 29.4% and 9.3%.

However, despite the huge run-up in the stock, analysts are confident the rally has more room to run. Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Muddling the Message Around ‘Climate Havens’ United’s shares jumped more than 37% in October, their best monthly return since surging 40% in February 2010. The recent gains have propelled United’s 93% year-to-date rise, trouncing peers Delta Air Lines Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc. which have risen 44% and 24% respectively. If the gains hold through the end of the year, it’ll be the stock’s best annual performance on record. “United is representative of a broadening of the market,” said Jane Edmondson, head of thematic strategy at TMX VettaFi. “If we continue to see this growth trend over the next few quarters, it’s definitely going to be on people’s radars,” she added. So what’s behind investors’ heightened appetite for the stock? Industry-wide plans to cut back on unprofitable routes over the summer have contributed to strength within the sector more broadly, with the S&P Supercomposite Airlines Sub Industry Index trading around levels unseen in nearly three years. Earnings from United pushed gains further after the Chicago-based carrier reported third-quarter profit in mid-October that beat Wall Street’s projections. Subdued oil prices are also a big help as aviation fuel is one of the industry’s biggest expenses. United’s stock closed Friday at its highest level since February 2020, climbing for a record-extending 13 straight weeks. United has also been reaping the benefits of numerous tailwinds including corporate and international travel momentum, monetization of its MileagePlus frequent flier program and savvy investments such as incorporating Starlink Wi-Fi across its fleet, according to TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald. But the outperformance has not come without bouts of turbulence for the cyclical sector. Airline share prices are at the mercy of fuel price swings and furthermore, aircraft delivery delays and a well-publicized labor dispute at Boeing Co. have presented headaches for the airline industry. The shortage of airplanes is forcing customers like United to find alternatives, such as keeping older and more inefficient planes in service, which puts pressure on costs.           ",

Notably, the same-store sales growth improved on strong contributions from both the KFC and Pizza Hut brands as the company continued to optimize pricing while introducing new offerings and recipes. Another important contributor to the improved momentum was the delivery business, which grew 18% year on year, representing 40% of sales during the quarter, helping the business meet the demands of solo diners. Lastly, YUMC continued to expand to underserved and lower-tier markets, adding 1,200 new stores in the first nine months of the year. Zooming out, we think this was a strong quarter, highlighting continued improvements in its key operating segments. Is now the time to buy Yum China? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Yum China’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 10 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 18.8% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue outperforming Wall Street's estimates, driven by better-than-expected same-store sales and a higher number of locations. Profitability was also solid, leading to an EPS beat. Looking ahead, the company reiterated that from 2024 to 2026, system sales and profit are expected to grow at annual rates ranging from high single digits to double digits, leading to a double-digit compound annual growth rate for earnings per share. Zooming out, this was a fantastic quarter that should have shareholders cheering. Yum China is up 14.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $48.70 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $51.01 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Yum China’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,160.

Founded by consignment store aficionado Julie Wainwright, The RealReal (NASDAQ: REAL) is an online marketplace for buying and selling secondhand luxury goods. Marketplaces have existed for centuries. Where once it was a main street in a small town or a mall in the suburbs, sellers benefitted from proximity to one another because they could draw customers by offering convenience and selection. Today, a myriad of online marketplaces fulfill that same role, aggregating large customer bases, which attracts commission-paying sellers, generating flywheel scale effects that feed back into further customer acquisition. A company’s long-term performance can give signals about its business quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, The RealReal grew its sales at a decent 12.3% compounded annual growth rate. This is a useful starting point for our analysis. This quarter, The RealReal reported year-on-year revenue growth of 11%, and its $147.8 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3.2%. Management is currently guiding for a 12.6% year-on-year increase next quarter.           ",

        "body": "Citi says the election appears to be having a smaller impact on stocks compared to previous years. Analysts point to a relatively low VIX reading, a strong market rally, and rotation into pricier stocks. They say these trends show traders are more focused on economic conditions, the Fed, and earnings. The election tends to have a strong impact on the path of the market in the run-up to the vote, but traders appear focused on other things this year, Citi analysts said. The analysts said several market indicators that normally flash ahead of US elections are notably quiet this year, signaling potentially fewer worries about the election's impact on the market than in past years. Instead of the election, traders are dialing in on the US economy and earnings season, the analysts say. \"For the lead-up to the US election, equity market behavior has not been in line with previous elections,\" the analysts said in a Monday note. \"Overall, this suggests that other risks, such as US macro, reporting season etc., are having a bigger influence than any perceived election risks.\" The analysts pointed to the market's continued rally into the months leading up to the election. They note that typically, investors rotate out of equities before the election, making the prior month's performance usually negative. The S&P 500 is down 0.3% in the last month, but in the last six months, it's up 10.7% as it continues a strong bull run. The analysts said that strong performance in the weeks leading up to Election Day is likely due to the strength of US economic conditions, rather than markets taking positions in a \"Trump Trade\" or a \"Harris Trade.\" \"US equities have been very strong coming into this election cycle compared to the past,\" the analysts said. \"The current anomaly has less to do with the market pricing a certain election outcome but more to do with an expectation of continued interest rate cutting combined with a likely shallower US economic slowdown.\" The Federal Reserve kicked off its easing cycle in September and is expected to continue with a series of 25 basis point interest rate cuts at upcoming meetings. Meanwhile, economists are increasingly expecting a \"soft landing\" for the US economy, as it dodges a steep recession while inflation continues to edge lower. A relatively low reading on the volatility index is another sign that markets may not be putting too much stock in the election outcome. A low VIX number is rare in election years, the analysts said.    ",

        "body": "Austrian packaging and recycling company ALPLA has opened a new plant in Ballito, marking its entry into the South African polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling market. The company opened the facility after approximately 18 months and invested €60m ($65.36m). The plant is situated on a 90,000m² site in the coastal town, located in the KwaZulu-Natal province. The investment is poised to enhance the production of safe and sustainable plastic packaging in the region. The new plant will generate up to 35,000 tonnes (t) of mechanically recycled PET (rPET) flakes and food-safe pellets each year from 2025, with 16,000t destined for conversion into rPET pellets. A new extrusion line has been installed at the site, with production scheduled to begin in early 2025 following customer approval of the flakes and pellets. The recycling facility has the capacity to house a second extrusion line if needed. , with an additional 30,000m² available for future expansions. The recycled material from this facility will be utilised at ALPLA's Lanseria-based production plant for creating PET preforms used in drink bottle manufacturing. ALPLA CEO Philipp Lehner said: \"South Africa is a strategically important market for us and one in which we want to continue to grow. “Together with our customers and partners, our aim is to provide safe, affordable and sustainable packaging solutions to our customers and to continue improving standards of living. With our investments in Ballito and before that in Lanseria, we have laid the foundation for a successful future.\" This development aligns with South Africa's extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulations enacted in 2021, mandating that PET drinks bottles include 20% recycled content by 2026. Ballito plant manager Gerhard Meyringer said: “With our expertise and experience in recycling and processing, we are a reliable partner for sustainable solutions. At the same time, we are promoting the circular economy in South Africa and reducing waste through close cooperation with regional collection programmes.” In May this year, ALPLA entered into a strategic partnership with Re-Purpose to increase its PET plastic recycling in the region. The collaboration focuses on developing solutions that promote the circular economy and job creation in KwaZulu-Natal and potentially across South Africa. \"ALPLA enters South African PET recycling market with €60m plant \" was originally created and published by Packaging Gateway, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "body": "Diesel retailers have been whipsawed by big swings in futures and wholesale prices in the past six to seven trading days, but the end result for the trucking industry’s key diesel benchmark was a drop in the weekly price. The Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration average weekly retail diesel price fell 3.7 cents a gallon Monday to $3.536. It’s the second decline in the past three weeks for the price used for most fuel surcharges, and takes it to the lowest level since Sept. 23. The sharp drop in diesel futures prices from a week ago, which at the time looked like it might signal the end of a recent cycle of higher commodity and retail diesel prices, fully reversed itself in one week and ended up moving higher in Monday trade. But retail prices lag futures moves, as evidenced by this week’s decline. Last week’s diesel futures market kicked off with a big drop followed by five consecutive days of gains, including the increase Monday of 5.02 cents a gallon to $2.2841, the highest settlement since Oct. 11. Without any significant change in market fundamentals last week, the price of ultra low sulfur diesel traded on the CME commodity exchange had an eventful week. On Oct. 28, ULSD fell almost 11 cents a gallon after an Israeli retaliatory attack on Iran did not target any of Iran’s oil production or export facilities. But ULSD futures prices then climbed during the course of the week, with the only real news on fundamentals being a somewhat bullish midweek report on U.S inventories. By Friday the settlement price of ULSD was just 42 basis points – 0.42 cents – less than where it had settled the prior Friday before the limited Israeli action. ULSD Monday rose 5.02 cents a gallon to $2.2841. The big increase Monday did come on the back of several pieces of news. Multiple reports said Iran was planning its own retaliatory attack on Israel that was likely to be larger in scope than the Oct. 1 attack by Iran on Israel. That was in retaliation for earlier actions Israel took against Hezbollah in Lebanon and other Israeli proxies in the region. The other fundamental news in the market over the weekend was the decision by the OPEC+ group to again cancel a 2.2 million-barrel-a-day increase in production that had originally been planned for September but was pushed back to December as oil markets continued to weaken. In a television interview, OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais downplayed the significance of the delay. “We have demonstrated to the market that we’re always very proactive when necessary, and we take decisions always in a way whereby we have the ability to pause them, reverse them or change them,” Al Ghais said. “And this is just a continuation of our policy of making sure that we’re very attentive to the market, the way the market behaves.”             ",

Today, we are looking at personal care stocks, starting with Coty (NYSE:COTY). While personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public’s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products. The 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 16.9% below. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 7.2% since the latest earnings results. With a portfolio boasting many household brands, Coty (NYSE:COTY) is a beauty products powerhouse with offerings in cosmetics, fragrances, and skincare. Coty reported revenues of $1.36 billion, flat year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a miss of analysts’ earnings estimates and underwhelming earnings guidance for the full year. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 21.5% since reporting and currently trades at $7.48. Read our full report on Coty here, it’s free. Co-founded by actress Jessica Alba, The Honest Company (NASDAQ:HNST) sells diapers and wipes, skin care products, and household cleaning products. The Honest Company reported revenues of $93.05 million, up 10.1% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 6.8%. The business had an exceptional quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings and gross margin estimates. The Honest Company pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 19% since reporting. It currently trades at $3.86. Is now the time to buy The Honest Company?

The massive physical footprints of cell phone towers, fiber in the ground, or satellites in space make it challenging for companies in this industry to adjust to shifting consumer habits. Over the last decade-plus, consumers have ‘cut the cord’ to their landlines and traditional cable subscriptions in favor of wireless communications and streaming video. These trends do mean that more households need cell phone plans and high-speed internet. Companies that successfully serve customers can enjoy high retention rates and pricing power since the options for mobile and internet connectivity in any geography are usually limited. A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall business quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last five years, Altice’s revenue declined by 1.5% per year. This shows demand was weak, a rough starting point for our analysis. We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. Altice’s recent history shows its demand has stayed suppressed as its revenue has declined by 4.1% annually over the last two years. Altice also discloses its number of broadband subscribers and pay tv subscribers, which clocked in at 4.04 million and 1.94 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Altice’s broadband subscribers averaged 2.8% year-on-year declines while its pay tv subscribers averaged 11.3% year-on-year declines.          ",

Now traders are finally at their day of reckoning. Trump Media stock fell 6% before the bell on Monday. Traders and investors say the stock is at risk of extreme volatility after the result of Tuesday's election is known, with its trading detached from its day-to-day business fundamentals. The company operates the Truth Social media platform and has launched a streaming service. \"This stock is insanely overvalued and the economics make no sense whatsoever, even if Donald Trump is elected,\" said Brian Lukow, a former Lehman Brothers senior vice president-turned-movie producer who now shorts stocks, a bet that the price of a stock will fall. In Trump Media, he thinks he has found his next best bet, if Democratic candidate Kamala Harris wins. For the second quarter, Trump Media reported a loss of $16.4 million and revenue of $837,000. The company has a market capitalization of around $6 billion. \"The stock is going to crash and burn if Harris pulls out a victory,\" said Lukow, who said he continues to hold his short position. \"If Trump wins, then this bet looks like the greatest bet he's ever made.\" For weeks, the rise in Trump Media stock has come in tandem with Trump's surge on election betting sites such as Polymarket, where the odds of the Republican's chances of winning rose as high as 67%. This movement has drawn scrutiny from social media users and online gambling experts because it came alongside some large bets from a Paris-based trader and diverged sharply from opinion polls, which have had the race in a dead heat. Last week, as Trump Media stock dropped sharply, however, so did Trump's chances on Polymarket. On Sunday, the odds had Trump at around 54%. There is no formal analyst coverage of Trump Media, which is 57% owned by Trump himself. The former president's stake in the company is worth $3.5 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Trump's total net worth, as of Sunday, stands at $5.6 billion, according to Forbes magazine. The Trump campaign referred questions to Trump Media & Technology Group, the company's full name. TMTG did not respond to a request for comment.

WM completed its $7.2 billion acquisition of Stericycle on Monday. The transaction valued the company at $62 per share. The assets are now part of the WM Healthcare Solutions division. “This acquisition provides a complementary business platform in medical waste, a sector with attractive near- and long-term growth dynamics, and in secure information destruction services to further our leading suite of comprehensive waste and environmental solutions,” said CEO Jim Fish in a statement. Rafa Carrasco, a senior vice president at WM who managed the deal integration team, will now serve as president of WM Healthcare Solutions. The largest deal in the North American waste industry this year marks WM’s return to focusing on the medical waste sector. WM said it decided to acquire Stericycle in part because of how aging populations are expected to help grow the medical waste business. Illinois-based Stericycle, founded in 1989, grew amid a period of focus on syringes and medical waste. It expanded through multiple acquisitions over the years, including through the large purchase of assets from Allied Waste and BFI in 1999. Stericycle went public in 1996. Stericycle also encountered a range of financial and regulatory challenges along the way. CEO Cindy Miller — who jointed the company following a career with UPS and took on the top role in 2019 — is credited with helping to improve operations through a series of divestitures, the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and other measures. As of this spring, when the deal was announced, Stericycle operated an estimated 5,200 vehicles, 18 medical waste incinerators (plus a new site in Nevada), 71 autoclaves or alternative treatment facilities, 177 transfer stations, 105 document destruction sites and 25 other operating locations. At the time, 85% of its revenue came from North America and the rest was international. Prior to the deal, WM listed medical waste as among its services, but analysts said it represented a small fraction of the overall business after the industry giant dabbled in the space off and on over the years. In 2005, the company launched Waste Management Healthcare Solutions to provide regulated medical waste services for hospitals and other large waste generators. By 2009, then-CEO David Steiner said in a Q1 earnings call that the company was “taking the first steps toward creating a national footprint in medical waste” and that “we fully expect by the end of the year we'll be the second-largest medical waste player in the industry.”          ",

        "body": "By Lawrence White LONDON (Reuters) -Stocks were steady on Tuesday but implied volatility ratcheted up in currency markets in an early indication of the market frenzy to come, as the world awaits the outcome of a knife-edge U.S. election. Overnight implied volatility options for euro/dollar spiked to the highest since November 2016, as did those for the dollar-Mexican peso pair, in recognition that the latter could be hard hit by protectionist policies if Republican Donald Trump defeats Democrat candidate Kamala Harris. Europe's benchmark STOXX index edged down 0.2% while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched 0.7% higher, as stock markets held their breath ahead of Wednesday's open. Currencies, which unlike shares trade around the clock, saw more action albeit still offering only scattered and contradictory indications of which candidate investors were betting on. The dollar, which had eased as traders made final tweaks to positions, bought 152.46 yen and changed hands at $1.0879 per euro. \"They've priced what they think is price-able and that's that,\" said Westpac strategist Imre Speizer, adding that a clear win for Trump would lift the dollar, while a win for Harris would push it a little lower. Bitcoin added 2.7% to about $68,884, with Trump viewed by analysts as enacting more favourable policies for cryptocurrencies than Harris. Election day ends an acrimonious campaign jolted by assassination attempts on Trump and the withdrawal of President Joe Biden in favour of Harris, with polls showing the candidates virtually tied. Markets are on edge about how Trump's protectionist trade policies in particular could stoke inflation and hit exports in the world's biggest consumer market with bonds and the dollar expected to move on the outcome of the election. \"Ultimately the U.S. election comes down to this - whether the U.S. electorate wants to vote for economic policy continuity, institutional stability and liberal democracy (Harris) or radical trade policy, a further retreat for globalization and strongman democracy (Trump),\" J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note. \"In short, a vote for stability or change.\" BRACED China is seen on the front line of tariff risk and the currency in particular is trading on tenterhooks with implied volatility against the dollar around record highs. The yuan hovered at 7.1083 per dollar, while Chinese stock markets surged to almost one-month highs as investors expect a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to approve local government debt refinancing and spending.

While Trump maintains his frontrunner status, recent market data suggests a significant shift in momentum. According to the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, Harris's odds have surged dramatically from 33% on Oct. 30 to approximately 44%, while Trump's position has weakened to a two-week low of 56%. This trend is similar on Kalshi, a regulated U.S. betting platform, where Harris trails by just two percentage points with 49% odds. The shifting odds coincide with emerging polling data from crucial battleground states. Iowa, traditionally a Republican stronghold that Trump carried in both 2016 and 2020, now shows Harris leading 47% to 44%, with particularly strong support among women voters. This potential flip in Iowa could signal broader electoral shifts across key states. However, some market observers have raised questions about the validity of these movements, with some suggesting possible market manipulation and suspicious trading patterns appear designed to influence the odds in both directions. While betting markets have historically proven to be reliable predictive tools, they're not infallible. The 2016 election is a notable example, where these markets significantly underestimated Trump's chances of victory. ",

The 2024 presidential election is a day away, and with both candidates polling closely, speculation about a second Trump administration now heavily involves Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Specifically, if Musk will head up Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). If that happens, “I think he will still be heavily involved with [Tesla],” Bank of America senior auto analyst John Murphy told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). Musk most recently participated in the Trump rally that took place at New York City’s Madison Square Garden. He has continued to put out pro-Trump posts on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he owns. Trump’s proposed department holds a bit of that Musk/Trump folklore because its acronym and the ticker for dogecoin (DOGE-USD) are the same. Dogecoin is the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to Yahoo Finance data, and a favorite of Musk's. The former president recently shared plans to create a department that would “eliminate fraud and improper payments” with a six month timeline to complete the tasks. The department could be run by Musk. In response, Musk shared on X that he would do the job with “no pay, no title, no recognitions needed.” He said close to $2 trillion in costs could be stripped out of government, though critics have disputed whether that level of cost-cutting is possible without disrupting benefits to Social Security and Medicare.  However, if Musk were to take the position, it would raise questions about the fate of Tesla. “If there is a change in the White House and Trump wins and Elon goes to run the DOGE, who is his No. 2 at Tesla?” Murphy said. “I don’t think there’s really a No. 2 that I could point to that would replace him or really could replace him.” The company's most recent beta projects in autonomous cars and humanoid robots have continued to evolve. Tesla most recently shared that a fleet of driverless vehicles should begin to hit markets as soon as 2025 or 2026. Tesla stock has surged over 1,000% over the past five years. Musk not seeing these projects through could initially unsettle the faithful bulls that have long championed Tesla's stock. “The other side of the equation of the opportunity [with] Elon getting involved in the government, you could run national regulations on autonomy,” said Murphy.

Its non-GAAP profit of $1.45 per share was also 26.1% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy FOX? Find out in our full research report. Revenue: $3.56 billion vs analyst estimates of $3.37 billion (5.7% beat) Adjusted EPS: $1.45 vs analyst estimates of $1.15 (26.1% beat) EBITDA: $1.05 billion vs analyst estimates of $891.6 million (17.5% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 43.4%, up from 41.9% in the same quarter last year Operating Margin: 29.3%, up from 24% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 29.4%, up from 27.1% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was $94 million, up from -$70 million in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $18.48 billion Founded in 1915, Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) is a diversified media company, operating prominent cable news, television broadcasting, and digital media platforms. Broadcasting companies have been facing secular headwinds in the form of consumers abandoning traditional television and radio in favor of streaming services. As a result, many broadcasting companies have evolved by forming distribution agreements with major streaming platforms so they can get in on part of the action, but will these subscription revenues be as high quality and high margin as their legacy revenues? Only time will tell which of these broadcasters will survive the sea changes of technological advancement and fragmenting consumer attention. A company’s long-term performance can indicate its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Regrettably, FOX’s sales grew at a sluggish 4.5% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This shows it failed to expand in any major way, a rough starting point for our analysis. Long-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. FOX’s recent history shows its demand slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segments, Advertising and Affiliate, which are 37.3% and 51.7% of revenue. Over the last two years, FOX’s Advertising revenue (marketing services) was flat while its Affiliate revenue (licensing and retransmission fees) averaged 3.6% year-on-year growth.          ",

Apparel sales are not driven so much by personal needs but by seasons, trends, and innovation, and over the last few decades, the category has shifted meaningfully online. Retailers that once only had brick-and-mortar stores are responding with omnichannel presences. The online shopping experience continues to improve and retail foot traffic in places like shopping malls continues to stall, so the evolution of clothing sellers marches on. The 9 apparel retailer stocks we track reported a strong Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 1.1% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line. Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 9.3% since the latest earnings results. Originally serving yogis and hockey players, Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) is a designer, distributor, and retailer of athletic apparel for men and women. Lululemon reported revenues of $2.37 billion, up 7.3% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 1.5%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates but full-year revenue guidance missing analysts’ expectations. Calvin McDonald, Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"In the second quarter, lululemon delivered revenue and earnings growth, with ongoing strength across our international business. In the U.S., our teams continue to optimize our product assortment and remain focused on driving forward our opportunities in the market. Looking ahead, we feel confident in the long runway in front of us as we execute on our Power of Three ×2 growth plan.\" Lululemon delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 23.9% since reporting and currently trades at $320.89. Is now the time to buy Lululemon? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free. Operating under The Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands, The Gap (NYSE:GAP) is an apparel and accessories retailer that sells its own brand of casual clothing to men, women, and children.

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Concerns are mounting after lenders including Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. and IndusInd Bank Ltd. reported elevated stress in unsecured loans during second-quarter earnings, sending shares sliding. The pain is more acute in firms like Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd. that focus on smaller-ticket loans, with the stock down more than 30% this year. Personal-loan growth is moderating as the central bank last year clamped down on risky lending practices following a post-pandemic surge in credit. The impact is trickling into the market and company earnings, signaling more pain ahead for the world’s fastest-growing major economy. “The issue will continue for at least the next two quarters and slippages and credit costs will remain high,” said Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at Anand Rathi Securities. “If the demand for these loans doesn’t pick up in the festive season, the stress can last much longer.” Choudhary is underweight on the space. Last November, the Reserve Bank of India asked banks to set aside more capital for unsecured consumer credit, including small loans, as regulators grew concerned about borrowers buying items they could not afford. The increased cost of loans coupled with collection disruptions during the federal elections between April and June spurred a string of delinquencies. In August, personal loan growth slowed to 14% from over 30% in the year-ago period. Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd. and IIFL Finance Ltd. warned in earnings calls last month they expect the challenging situation to continue in the coming quarters. Traders have already headed for the exit. Shares of microfinance lenders such as Fusion Finance Ltd. and Spandana Sphoorty Financial Ltd. are down more than 60% so far this year, in contrast to a 15% gain in the BSE 500 over the period. Private players have seen an impact too. Arohan Financial Services Pvt., which provides loans primarily to financially underserved women, is delaying an initial public offering. This followed an RBI order last month asking a group of shadow lenders to stop sanctioning new loans because of the high interest rates they charge customers.          ",

        "body": "Rachel Reeves’s tax grab sparked a record exodus from the stock market last month as investors raced to withdraw their cash. Investors sold down a net £2.7bn of their holdings in equity funds in October – the highest amount ever recorded – with Brits pulling money out of every category of fund. That followed a move by savers to withdraw cash in September, which marked the first net outflows in 11 months, according to data from fund network Calastone. The figures highlight the chilling effect of the Labour Government’s first Budget after the Chancellor confirmed increases to capital gains tax, with the rate paid by basic-rate taxpayers rising from 10pc to 18pc and from 20pc to 24pc for higher-rate taxpayers. Capital gains tax is paid by savers every time a stock or unit in an equity fund is sold, unless they are sheltered through an individual savings account (Isa). Sell orders on equity funds surged by 36pc month on month to a record £17bn in the four weeks leading up to the Budget as savers attempted to crystallise a profit and pay less tax. But outflows stopped completely on Budget day when the higher tax rates came into immediate effect. Sell orders dropped 40pc overnight, according to Calastone. At the same time, buying activity also rose sharply as some chose to reinvest the proceeds of their sales, but it was not enough to outpace the wave of selling. Edward Glyn, head of global markets at Calastone, said: “Fears of a capital gains tax grab in last week’s Budget spurred investors to book their profits and crystallise a lower tax bill well before the Chancellor rose to her feet in the Commons. “Unease in September meant the early birds took flight first, but by October investors were flocking for the exits.” UK assets were by far the hardest hit by the stampede. More than one third (£988m) of the total outflows was pulled from funds focused on UK equities, making October the fourth worst month on record for the sector. The sell down is likely to prompt more fears about the health of the London market. Analysts have complained about a “doom loop” for the stock exchange, with the value of UK companies declining due to a surge of investors bailing out of British stocks. Another quarter of outflows came from funds which pay a regular dividend to savers, which are known as income funds and heavily skewed towards the UK stock market. October was also the first month in more than a year in which UK investors withdrew cash from US equity funds, while it was the first month in more than two years that global equity funds recorded outflows.

Set to make its full debut for the first time at the Singapore FinTech Festival, this project will directly embed foreign exchange swaps within the blockchain. The development represents another key step in the modernization of money market funds, which are investment vehicles that would invest in short-term government securities, such as U.S. Treasury bills. In return, tokenization promises a whole new level of transparency, line item position management efficiency, and instant redeemability, likely unlocking the doors to decentralized finance integrations as well. The project is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)’s Project Guardian, a global collaboration between financial institutions and policymakers to explore asset tokenization through blockchain technology. Sam Hewson, Citi's Head of FX Sales, sees this new class of assets as a revolutionary transformation in the future of digital assets: \"As tokenization continues to evolve in capital markets, we see a potential future in which investors could trade and settle digital assets in real-time, in different currencies, and across multiple distributed ledger technology platforms.” This announcement comes hot on the heels of UBS's recent foray into the tokenization space with their uMINT platform, the UBS USD Money Market Investment Fund Token.

The investors said fossil fuel and industrial companies should do well under Trump, per the survey. Stanley Druckenmiller said in mid-October that markets were \"very convinced\" of a Republican victory. Many of the bigwigs of finance have picked their sides, but Wall Street seems to believe one candidate has the upper hand in this year's presidential election. Betting markets have leaned toward former President Donald Trump, and the billionaire investor Stan Druckenmiller said the financial markets had already priced in a Trump win. A note from the London-based Barclays analyst Emmanuel Cau said European stocks were already trading at a discount because of the potential impact of tariffs. In a survey of SumZero's investor community — a mix of small hedge funds, family offices, private-equity firms, and more — taken over the first two weeks of October, 53% said they believed Trump would prevail. The survey included responses from just 119 members, but it's drawn from a segment of analysts and investors influencing meaningful amounts of money. The consensus among respondents was that a Trump victory would create a favorable environment for companies in the fossil fuels, financials, and US industrials sectors. Meanwhile, most respondents said that \"renewable energy, ESG investments, and retail\" might struggle. SumZero — which was founded by Divya Narendra, who started Facebook's predecessor with the Winklevoss twins in college — has more than 16,000 investors on its platform sharing investment ideas, according to its website. This Trump belief isn't limited to fans of the former president. Ken Griffin, the billionaire Citadel founder and big GOP donor, has been critical of the former president, calling him a \"three-time loser\" in 2022. But at a conference in Saudi Arabia last week, he predicted Trump would beat Vice President Kamala Harris, even if it's close. \"It is a race that Trump is favored to win, but it is almost a coin toss,\" Griffin said at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh. Prediction markets, which have exploded this year as online gambling grows across the US, certainly lean toward Trump, and Druckenmiller said in mid-October that markets were \"very convinced\" of a Republican victory. But Wall Street has certainly been wrong before. Few mainstream investors and bankers supported Trump in his first run when he unexpectedly beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. This time around, he has big-name billionaire supporters, such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and a victory wouldn't catch the investment community off guard again. One of the world's most accurate economists, Christophe Barraud, for instance, is putting his credibility on the line for a Trump win.    ",

        "body": "By Ankika Biswas and Pranav Kashyap (Reuters) - As Americans go to the polls to elect a new president, investors are trying to gauge how stock markets will react as polls and betting platforms point to a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris' lead over the Republican has dwindled to a single percentage point in the final stretch of the presidential contest, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday. A majority of a dozen analysts that Reuters spoke to expect a Trump return to boost equity markets, with some favoring a split government. Crypto stocks and small-caps have gained in the lead up to the election. Trump's pledge to cut corporate taxes and decrease regulations could boost markets in the short-term if he wins, said Bel Air Investment Advisors Chairman Todd Morgan. On the other hand, Trump has promised to double down on trade tariffs, especially against China, and \"rescind all unspent funds\" under a signature Biden-Harris climate law that includes hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for electric vehicles, solar and other clean energy technologies. A divided Congress may be the best outcome as it limits what the president can accomplish and spend, according to Brian Klimke, chief market strategist at Cetera Investment Management. Here's a list of stocks and sectors that could move on the election outcome: TRUMP TRADE BANKS: A Trump win or Republican sweep could lift Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo on improved domestic investment, looser regulations, domestic job additions and tax cuts, Bank of America analysts said. However, concerns around a wider trade deficit and tariffs are viewed as negative for the sector. M&A beneficiaries include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lazard and Evercore amid a more lenient approach to antitrust regulation enforcement. CRYPTO: A more \"receptive\" regulatory approach to digital assets under a Trump win could benefit crypto stocks, according to TD Cowen analysts who highlighted the likelihood of the former president naming a pro-crypto SEC chair. MicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, MARA Holdings, Hut 8 and Bit Digital climbed between 3.4% and 45% in October. ENERGY: Morgan Stanley analysts believe a Trump presidency could prioritize reducing the regulatory burden on domestic oil and gas production, while considering the possibility of more restrictive trade policies. \"Trump's support for fossil fuel industries could benefit oil and gas stocks, as he would likely pursue policies that favor domestic energy production,\" said Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com.

Shares of nuclear power generators lost ground as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected Talen's deal to provide power for Amazon's data centers. The president of Belarus proposed potash production cuts, helping boost shares of Mosaic and other fertilizer producers.  Major U.S. equities indexes moved lower on Tuesday, the final market session before Election Day. Beyond the pivotal political developments, the trading week will include the Federal Reserve's interest-rate announcement on Thursday and the latest stream of corporate earnings reports. The S&P 500 closed 0.3% lower as voters prepared to head to the polls. The Nasdaq also fell 0.3%, while the Dow lost 0.6%. Shares of power generator Constellation Energy (CEG) plunged 12.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, as a decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about the nuclear power industry. The regulatory agency reportedly rejected a deal between Amazon (AMZN) and nuclear generator Talen (TLN), citing a potential negative impact for nearby customers if Talen dedicates additional energy from its nuclear facility to power the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant's data center. Similar regulatory scrutiny could fall on a deal signed by Constellation Energy last month that would see the company restart a shuttered nuclear unit in Pennsylvania to provide power for Microsoft (MSFT) data centers. The headwinds facing nuclear generators also weighed on shares of New Jersey-based utility Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG), which sank 6.2%. In addition to the industry pressure, the company reported mixed results for the third quarter, falling short of profit expectations but exceeding top-line forecasts. Although the company benefitted from higher energy margins and tax credits, it now expects to exceed its initial full-year capital plan. United Airlines (UAL) shares fell 4.0%, reversing some of the strong gains the carrier posted in October. While bullishness about the airline industry has centered on well-timed capacity reductions over the summer, an uptick in crude oil futures prices on Monday and the prospect of higher fuel costs may have contributed to the pressure on United stock. Shares of fertilizer giant Mosaic (MOS) surged 5.4% on Monday, the top daily performance in the S&P 500, following reports that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko proposed cutting potash production levels in an effort to boost prices for the key crop nutrient. Any pricing improvement would be welcome news for Mosaic, which has warned that operational issues could restrain potash production and shipment volumes this quarter. Sherwin-Williams (SHW) shares jumped 4.6% after news emerged that the paint maker's stock will be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), replacing chemical giant Dow Inc. (DOW) on the price-weighted index of 30 blue-chip companies, effective prior to the start of trading on Friday. S&P Dow Jones Indices also announced that AI chip behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) will replace Intel (INTC) on the DJIA. Inclusion in such a widely followed index can provide a boost to stock prices as index-tracking funds purchase shares. ",

Started by Peter Thiel after seeing US defence agencies struggle in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) offers software as a service platform that helps government agencies and large enterprises use data to make better decisions. Organizations generate a lot of data that is stored in silos, often in incompatible formats, making it slow and costly to extract actionable insights, which in turn drives demand for modern cloud-based data analysis platforms that can efficiently analyze the siloed data. A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall business quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last three years, Palantir grew its sales at a decent 22.7% compounded annual growth rate. This is a useful starting point for our analysis. This quarter, Palantir reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 30%, and its $725.5 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 3.1%. Management is currently guiding for a 26.4% year-on-year increase next quarter.         ",

Morgan Stanley Futures (China), wholly owned by the U.S. bank, was for the first time listed as a licensed institution by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Friday, a filing from the regulator showed. A company spokesperson confirmed the approval, which permits the U.S. bank to serve domestic clients or cater to the demand of offshore investors under China's qualified institution programme. \"We will continue to work closely with relevant regulators and futures exchanges and we look forward to launching the business soon,\" the firm said in a statement to Reuters.

Some consumer discretionary companies don’t fall neatly into a category because their products or services are unique. Although their offerings may be niche, these companies have often found more efficient or technology-enabled ways of doing or selling something that has existed for a while. Technology can be a double-edged sword, though, as it may lower the barriers to entry for new competitors and allow them to do serve customers better. A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall business quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Over the last five years, Frontdoor grew its sales at a sluggish 6.3% compounded annual growth rate. This shows it failed to expand in any major way, a rough starting point for our analysis. Long-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. Frontdoor’s recent history shows its demand slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 4.8% over the last two years is below its five-year trend.           ",

The weekend before the U.S. presidential election, crypto-based prediction market Polymarket spun up a contract betting on who will be inaugurated as the next leader of the free world. As anyone who has paid the slightest bit of attention to crypto or election news coverage this year knows, Polymarket already had a heavily traded contract on which candidate will win the presidential race. That contract has seen more than $3 billion in trading volume, according to Polymarket, with more than $200 million worth of open interest, or positions outstanding, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard prepared by the user mahdi0077. There's a subtle difference between the \"winner\" contract, which Polymarket has listed since February, and the new \"inauguration\" one. That difference highlights a challenge facing prediction markets ahead of Tuesday's vote in a politically polarized, low-trust environment. Namely: What if the election results aren't clear shortly after the polls close? Or, if they are clear to one side, what if the purportedly losing candidate disputes them, as Donald Trump did four years ago, leading to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot? Or if one candidate concedes but then withdraws the concession, as Democrat Albert Gore did in 2000, leading to a Supreme Court case? There \"could be a hornet's nest about this next week,\" Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, told CoinDesk by email last week. In prediction markets, traders bet on verifiable outcomes of real-world events in specified time frames. Typically, they buy \"yes\" or \"no\" shares in an outcome, and each share pays $1 if the prediction comes true, or zero if not. (On Polymarket, bets are settled in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades one-to-one for dollars; other platforms, including Kalshi and PredictIt, pay out regular greenbacks.) As of Monday morning in New York, \"yes\" shares for Trump winning the presidency traded at 59 cents, indicating the market saw a 59% chance of victory for the Republican candidate. Democrat Kamala Harris' odds were at 41%. The rules for Polymarket's \"winner\" contract say it will resolve once all three of the Associated Press, Fox News and NBC call the race. However, if all three media outlets haven't done so for the same candidate by Inauguration Day (Jan. 20, 2025), the market will be resolved according to who is inaugurated.                  ",

        "body": "Investors aren't sure how to position their portfolios going into the US presidential election. Warren Buffett signaled in Berkshire Hathaway's third-quarter earnings that he was being cautious. The investor built a record cash pile, slashed his two biggest stock bets, and halted buybacks. Investors are puzzling over how to play the market ahead of Tuesday's US presidential election. Warren Buffett flashed his poker hand on Saturday, revealing he amassed a record amount of cash, cut his two largest stock bets, and stopped buying shares of his own company last quarter. Berkshire Hathaway's 94-year-old boss has refrained from endorsing either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, likely because he's worried the backlash could harm his employees and shareholders. But his conglomerate's third-quarter earnings offered fresh evidence that he's wary of heady stock valuations and eager to take some chips off the table. Between July and September 30, Buffett's company grew its mountain of cash, Treasury bills, and other liquid investments to an unprecedented $325 billion (or $310 billion, subtracting nearly $15 billion of payables for Treasury bill purchases). Two years ago, Berkshire had less than $110 billion in cash. The legendary investor and his team sold $36 billion in shares and only made purchases worth $1.5 billion, marking their eighth straight quarter as net sellers. They offloaded a net $127 billion of stocks over the first nine months of 2024 — more than triple the net $24 billion worth they jettisoned last year and a stark shift from the net $34 billion of stock they bought in 2022. Notably, Berkshire pared its bets on Apple and Bank of America, its two largest stock positions going into the quarter. It sliced its stake in the iPhone maker by 60% between January and September, reducing its value from about $174 billion to $70 billion. Berkshire also cut its holding in the banking giant by about 23% between mid-July and early October, reducing its worth to below $32 billion. Buffett has said that buybacks only make financial sense when a stock is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value. After repurchasing $20 billion of Berkshire shares between the start of 2022 and June 30 this year, Buffett didn't buy back a single share last quarter — a strong signal that he no longer sees his company's stock as a bargain following its more than 20% gain this year to record highs. \"When the world's most famous living investor continues to sell down shares and sit on a considerable cash pile, it tells you something very important about the state of the market,\" Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, said in a note on Monday.

Treasury yields, the US dollar, the Mexican peso, bitcoin, and Trump Media stocks are shifting. A surprise shift in a key presidential poll over the weekend has swung betting odds toward Kamala Harris, hitting a host of \"Trump trades\" that have rallied in recent weeks. A poll released over the weekend found Harris leading former President Donald Trump in Iowa, 47% to 44%. The poll, from The Des Moines Register/Mediacom and conducted by the pollster J. Ann Selzer, is significant in that Iowa has long been considered a state that Trump would win. \"It's hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,\" Selzer told The Des Moines Register. \"She has clearly leaped into a leading position.\" The poll sent shock waves across betting markets over the weekend, with Kalshi showing Harris' odds briefly overtaking Trump, 51% to 49%, for the first time since early October. As of Monday at 11:35 a.m. ET, the odds on the betting site were 55% for Trump and 45% for Harris. On Polymarket, where Trump's odds were over 60% last week, they've fallen to 58.1%, with Harris' odds at 42.8%. The big swing in betting odds created waves that are being felt in financial markets on the eve of the election. Here's where things stand for five parts of the Trump trade. The 10-year US Treasury yield plunged 12 basis points on Monday, falling to 4.275% after the weekend's polling surprise. A run-up in Treasury yields since the Fed cut interest rates in September reflected the market's belief that a second Trump presidency looked likely and that it would be an inflationary event because of his promises to implement sweeping tariffs and mass deportations, which would fuel higher prices and wage growth, respectively. Investors in recent weeks priced in higher yields on the view that Trump's policies would make it hard for the Fed to lower rates much further. The dollar soared in October as the odds of a Trump presidency rose, with markets predicting that potential tariffs and higher interest rates would boost the currency versus rivals. The US dollar index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, jumped about 4% in October. However, that trade slipped on Monday following Harris' rising betting odds, with the US dollar index falling nearly 1% to 103.55.            ",

Some investors have turned to prediction markets, while others have looked to crypto markets, with bitcoin down from its highs last week.  Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) closed Monday higher, shaking off earlier losses to extend a volatile stretch of trading for the company that has become a measure of investors’ moods ahead of Election Day. The company, parent of Truth Social and majority owned by former President Donald Trump, is far from the only vehicle for election betting. Some investors have turned to prediction markets, while others have looked to crypto markets. Trump Media has lately been a high-profile example of the action ahead of tomorrow, though. Trading on little in the way of company news, the stock last week both rose 40% above the previous week’s close and fell more than 20% below it. Trading in the shares was hit with halts several times along the way, and the company’s multibillion-dollar market cap vacillated. The stock continued its back-and-forth trading Monday, finishing the day up some 12% to over $34. Recent polling seen by some analysts as beneficial to Trump’s principal opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, may have shifted some traders’ bets earlier in the session—a dynamic also seen on prediction markets that, while generally indicating a belief in a Trump victory, have also moved somewhat toward Harris in recent days. Bitcoin (BTC), which has outperformed the S&P 500 in recent months, has lately pulled back from recent highs; investors generally see Trump as more crypto-friendly, though his Harris has also signaled support for the industry. Bitcoin was trading below $68,000 recently, more than $5,000 below its highs from last week. Some single stocks have also become particularly linked with the outcome of the election. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is an outspoken Trump supporter, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has an “outperform” rating on the EV maker’s shares, suggested a range of election scenarios that could affect the stock. These include the possibility of a trade war with China that could weigh on Tesla sales in that market but also a more welcoming environment for the company’s autonomy initiatives, Ives said in a note Sunday. If, instead of or in addition to, wagering on election outcomes, you’re interested in the policies that the election might produce, here are Investopedia’s roundups of the economic policies espoused by Trump and Harris.

This initiative, part of the company's exploration into the smart glasses sector, involves focus groups led by Apple’s Product Systems Quality team. The study, which began recently at the company's Cupertino headquarters, is aimed at understanding the smart glasses category. \"Testing and developing products that all can come to love is very important to what we do at Apple,\" the company in an email told the publication. The publication previously reported that Apple was considering entering the smart glasses market, a move that could challenge Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. However, any resulting product from Apple is anticipated to be several years away from launch. In a separate development, the company has proposed plans to invest nearly $10m in Indonesia to address a ban on its latest iPhone sales, the news publication reported citing people familiar with the matter. The investment is expected to involve a factory at Bandung in southeast of Jakarta which develops products such as accessories and components for Apple devices. The proposal is said to be under review by Indonesia's Ministry of Industry, which enforced the ban due to Apple not meeting the 40% domestic content requirement. A decision on the proposal is expected soon. Indonesia's stance on local manufacturing has affected other tech giants as well, with sales bans impacting Google Pixel phones and ByteDance's services until investment commitments were made. The latest development comes after Apple announced plans to invest approximately $1.5bn in satellite communications company Globalstar to expand iPhone satellite services. The deal between Apple and Globalstar involves a $1.1bn cash injection and a 20% equity stake for Apple, valued at $400m. Of this funding, more than $200m is designated to reduce Globalstar’s existing debt. \"Apple reportedly devising plans to enter smart glasses market\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.

But in reality, the top asset for many high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) isn't stocks. Instead, real estate dominates, making up a substantial chunk of their wealth. Don't Miss: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. $100K Sitting In A CD Account, Should I Move Money Into The Stock Market? This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Why the Wealthy Favor Real Estate For the ultra-wealthy, real estate isn't just another investment; it's the foundation of their portfolio. Real estate is a \"real asset\" with long-term growth potential that doesn't fluctuate as wildly as the stock market. This stability makes it especially attractive in uncertain times. According to Knight Frank, ultra-wealthy investors (those with $30 million or more in net worth) allocate about 32% of their wealth to residential properties and around 21% to commercial real estate. Altogether, that's more than half of their assets in real estate. These investors often own multiple properties in prime locations around the world. These aren't just trophy assets, either. Many properties are \"investments of passion,\" offering personal enjoyment and financial appreciation. Imagine a beach villa that appreciates and doubles as a luxurious retreat. This dual-purpose nature – lifestyle and investment – adds depth that stocks or bonds can't match. Trending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Real Estate vs. Other Investments So, where does this leave traditional assets like stocks and bonds? While stocks remain significant, they tend to make up less of ultra-wealthy portfolios than real estate. Stocks offer growth, but the wealthy are selective, often favoring large stakes in top companies, private equity or venture capital over risky ventures. On average, stocks account for about 26% of ultra-wealthy portfolios. For them, stocks are a growth tool, not the primary \"wealth builder.\" Bonds, meanwhile, have become less appealing due to their low returns in recent years. Bonds typically comprise about 10% of ultra-wealthy portfolios, especially in today's fluctuating interest rate environment. Instead, high-net-worth investors are increasingly drawn to alternative investments, like private equity, venture capital and luxury assets like art and collectibles. These alternatives help hedge against stock market volatility and inflation.                       ",

Also, a study from Northwestern Mutual found Americans believe they need $1.46 million in savings to retire comfortably. Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how It won’t be easy, but if you earn a good salary and are willing to live well below your means and save a big chunk of it, you may end up in a position where you’re able to retire by age 50. You’ll need to make sure your nest egg lasts those extra years, and you’ll need to figure out health insurance since Medicare eligibility doesn’t begin until age 65. You also can’t claim Social Security until 62 at the earliest, so you’ll be truly reliant on your savings to get by. Before we dive into the details and the pros and cons of each option you're considering, it's important to mention that the best way to secure your financial future is with a diversified portfolio that you adjust as your age. Focusing 100% on equities or real estate leaves you extremely vulnerable, especially as you approach your desired retirement age. When you're younger, most of your money should be in stocks since you can afford to take more risks, but as you grow older you need to get more conservative with your asset allocation. Investing in stocks could help you grow enough wealth to retire by age 50, provided you start at a young enough age. If you’re 29, you have a 21-year window to build your nest egg. It bears repeating, if you only hold stocks, you are taking on an immense amount of risk. If the market decides to dive before you retire, you could see all your plans destroyed. We can still crunch the numbers. If you’re able to invest $1,000 a month, and if your portfolio generates a yearly 8% return, which is a bit below the S&P 500’s historical average of 10%, then you could end up with a $600,000 nest egg. Make it $1,500 a month, and you’re looking at $900,000. To reach the $1.46 million figure Americans believe they’ll need, you would have to invest about $2400 a month.               ",

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround The CSI 300 Index rose 2.5% on Tuesday to close at the highest level since Oct. 8, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 2.6%. Both gauges ranked among the region’s top performers. Optimism is running high after Beijing ramped up efforts to revive its economy, and a private survey showed that the nation’s services activity expanded at the fastest pace since July. The top legislative body has reviewed a proposal to move some off-balance-sheet debt of local governments to their official accounts, paving the way for the first mid-year increase in the borrowing limit since 2015. Adding to the upbeat sentiment is Premier Li Qiang’s assessment that China has relatively ample room for fiscal and monetary policy, with conditions to ramp up countercyclical adjustments. All this helped Chinese equities to outperform their regional peers on a day when traders are gearing up for the US presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. “Chinese stocks are rallying on a wave of positive developments, driven by unexpectedly strong services activity and a shift in the US election outlook somewhat in favor of a Harris victory,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. Premier Li’s statements signaled Beijing’s continued commitment to support the economy, she added. The National People’s Congress Standing Committee met on Monday to discuss the plan to raise local governments’ debt ceiling to swap out their hidden debt, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The decision is intended to reduce the financial burden of local officials. The Caixin China services purchasing managers’ index rose to 52 in October from 50.3 the previous month, the biggest jump since March last year, Caixin and S&P Global said Tuesday. The pace of expansion exceeded a median forecast of 50.5 by economists. Chinese stocks have lost momentum after an earlier rally triggered by a policy blitz at end-September faded amid doubts about whether Beijing’s measures are enough to revive the economy.

Ann Selzer, an Iowa pollster celebrated for her accuracy, released her final pre-Election Day poll, which showed Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump 47% to 44% in the Hawkeye State. Both campaigns had all but written off Iowa as a surefire Trump victory. No Democrat has won Iowa since Obama in 2012. In 2016 and 2020, Trump won the state decisively by nine points and eight points respectively. “It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,” Selzer told the Des Moines Register, which first published the poll. “She has clearly leaped into a leading position.” Selzer’s poll thrust election forecasts into doubt. If Trump could lose a state so widely expected to go Republican, then perhaps it presaged electoral defeat elsewhere, such as in key Midwest battleground states. Prediction markets had already been trending away from Trump after his now-infamous Madison Square Garden rally on Oct. 27. Trump Media stock crashed 35% last week, also on the back of dwindling prospects in the election. But the Selzer poll added more bearishness to the so-called Trump trade on financial markets, which had previously been pricing in a Trump victory. Because Trump plans to institute such an unorthodox economic policy centered around his signature proposal of blanket tariffs, many investors were preparing for what they assumed would be a major upheaval in global markets. Selzer’s poll upended that assumption. As a result, markets shifted Monday toward preparing for a Trump loss. The U.S. dollar fell 0.7% on Monday, according to Bloomberg. The Mexican peso, which was expected to be among the hardest hit currencies under Trump’s tariff regime, strengthened 1.4% against the dollar. Meanwhile the euro was up 0.6% against the dollar. Stocks in Europe had been trading at lower prices because they expected to be hit hard by Trump’s tariffs. They lagged the broader market through October, according to an analyst note from Barclays published last month. The jump in the euro seems to indicate that at least to some degree those concerns have eased. U.S. Treasury yields declined Monday as Trump’s policies were seen as inflationary, likely limiting the Federal Reserve’s ability to lower rates further. Crypto markets also reacted to declines in Trump’s electoral chances. The price of Bitcoin dropped 1% on Monday. Trump has repositioned himself as a supporter of cryptocurrency after his earlier skepticism. In July at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Trump said he wanted the U.S. to become the “crypto capital of the planet.”    ",

Phillips, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Q1 represents another chapter of ‘controlling what we can control’ while navigating the challenging operating environment stemming from sustained end market weakness. Our results for the quarter were in line with expectations, considering the difficult comparisons from a record-setting Q1 last year. We continue to adjust costs, improve working capital management, and generate positive cash flow used to pay down debt. We made meaningful progress in the quarter with debt levels at a 2-year low, a result of the cash generated from operating activities and the proceeds from the disposition of the Automation, Test, and Measurement business, with its divestiture closing in July.” Founded in 1961, Kimball Electronics (NYSE:KE) is a global contract manufacturer specializing in electronics and manufacturing solutions for automotive, medical, and industrial markets. Like many equipment and component manufacturers, electrical systems companies are buoyed by secular trends such as connectivity and industrial automation. More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles.

Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround But there’s a separate risk investment pros are game-planning for that’s specific to a Trump victory: Elon Musk in the White House. Trump has said that he would establish a government efficiency commission headed by the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer if he wins. Last week, Musk pledged to slash at least $2 trillion from the US federal budget. Now, Piper Sandler & Co. has put together a list of 100 stocks that would be most affected by the plan, with Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp. among heavyweights that could see swings. READ: Musk Wants $2 Trillion Cut From US Budget. That Would Be Tough. A team led by Michael Kantrowitz, who last week won a top spot in this year’s Institutional Investor survey of US portfolio strategists, said a basket of stocks most sensitive to government spending has underperformed as Trump’s odds of winning increased — underscoring nervousness around what his administration will do to companies that rely on federal dollars. “The Elon headlines had clients asking about which stocks would be at risk of major cuts,” Kantrowitz said, adding that the list was a way to highlight stocks sensitive to government budget plans. The list includes corporate giants like Moderna Inc., FedEx Corp., CVS Health Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. among others, with industries ranging from aerospace equipment to defense manufacturing to biopharmaceuticals to health-plan providers. However, he emphasized that not all of the names in the lineup have negative risks. “Some of the aerospace and defense names could get a boost in the event of a Republican sweep on more defense spending,” he said. “So those would be a positive skew.” Musk floated the idea of unprecedented budget cuts at Trump’s rally in Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27. The $2 trillion reduction target surpasses the amount Congress spends annually on government agency operations, including defense, and would likely entail substantial cuts to key social safety net programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and veterans’ benefits.

A report from the FT says firms have made billions in loans to companies that use Nvidia chips as collateral. The risk is that new GPU technology is released regularly, and the existing collateral could lose value. Top Wall Street firms have loaned billions to a handful of tech companies that have used Nvidia's artificial intelligence-enabling GPUs as collateral, The Finanacial Times reported. According to the FT, big financial institutions including BlackRock, Blackstone, Pimco, and Carlyle, have made over $11 billion in loans to \"neocloud\" companies, tech companies that provide cloud services to other tech firms building AI products. These firms are among some of Nvidia's largest customers and include names like CoreWeave, Crusoe, and Lambda Labs. Collectively, they have purchased tens of thousands of Nvidia's highly sought-after chips and have offered them as collateral for loans that they use to buy even more GPUs, the report said. There are concerns, though, over the value of Nvidia's GPUs, with the price of existing AI chips potentially coming down as more advanced models are released and as companies potentially dial back AI spending. Having access to GPUs is no longer like having a \"golden ticket to Willy Wonka's factory,\" as it was considered to be a year ago, a senior executive at one of CoreWeave's lenders told the FT. Leasing contracts between neocloud firms and tech groups, meanwhile, are poised to expire in the coming years. That could result in a huge supply of chips making their way back to the market, the report added. CoreWeave, Crusoe, and Lambda Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Nvidia declined to comment. Elsewhere on Wall Street, there are concerns that Nvidia's huge pace of growth cannot be sustained, with doubts rising about returns on AI investment by corporations and the threat of competition from other chip makers muscling into the AI space.

        "body": "By Amina Niasse NEW YORK (Reuters) - CVS Health's David Joyner is expected to address how he will better manage rising patient costs in the Medicare business than his predecessor when he tackles his first earnings call as CEO on Wednesday, particularly after rivals have shown progress on that front in recent financial reports. Joyner replaced Karen Lynch as CEO three weeks ago as the company withdrew its 2024 earnings forecast and provided a third-quarter profit outlook far below analysts' expectations, citing medical spending in its insurance business. CVS shares are down 30% this year and the company faces pressure from investors including hedge fund Glenview Capital Management to improve shareholder value. In the Oct. 18 release, CVS said it had conducted a strategic review that included layoffs, write-downs and the decision to close 271 more retail stores. CVS, which owns insurer Aetna, one of the biggest pharmacy chains in the country and a large pharmacy benefit manager, has repeatedly missed financial expectations in the past year, largely due to costs in its Medicare Advantage plans for people aged 65 and older or who are disabled. \"Specific to CVS, their issue is they took on a lot of enrollment growth for 2024, and the patients that they brought on just carried much higher\" use of medical services, said Brian Tranquilut, an analyst at Jefferies. CVS's Medicare Advantage enrollment grew 7% to 4.1 million people this year, according to KFF, the biggest percentage increase of all such plans. It received lower quality ratings from the government, which hurt 2024 bonus payments. The company expects higher reimbursements in those plans in 2025. Nearly 90% of its members enrolled in Medicare Advantage were in health plans with high performance ratings. HIGHER COSTS Insurers managing government-sponsored plans have faced higher costs in both Medicare and Medicaid for low-income members following the COVID-19 pandemic due to changes in enrollment patterns and increased use of medical services delayed during the global health crisis. \"During the pandemic, people were not seeing the doctor as often as they were,\" said Dan Jones, vice president of Federal Affairs at the industry trade group Alliance of Community Health Plans. \"Now they're seeing doctors more often and are also being found to have higher (health risk) levels.\" The government needs to raise its payments to insurers in both Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to reflect the higher utilization, Jones said. Under the Affordable Care Act, the government's reimbursement for Medicare Advantage has been decreasing to align with traditional Medicare.           ",

The Oracle of Omaha and his conglomerate holding company Berkshire started to offload shares of Apple late last year, paring down a major bet on the tech company that it opened in 2016. Berkshire picked up its selling pace earlier this year and by the end of the second quarter, it had halved its stake in Apple, the Financial Times reported, helping to bring its cash reserve to an all-time-high of $277 billion at the time. But by the end of the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway smashed its previous cash record by selling another quarter of its stake in the tech company, or 100 million shares, bringing its total shares to 300 million, down from 400 million. In just over a year, the company has sold more than two-thirds of its stake in Apple. Although the tech company is still its top holding at $69.9 billion worth of shares, at its peak, Apple made up $178 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. The Apple-selling frenzy comes as Buffett has pared down his equity holdings across the board over the past two years. In the third quarter, Berkshire bought just $1.5 billion worth of stocks, making it a net seller of equities for the eighth consecutive quarter, CNN reported. Berkshire’s $325.2 billion in cash and short-term treasuries now outweigh the market value of its equities, which stood at $271.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter, according to its most recent earnings report. While some have questioned Berkshire's big stock sales, over the last three years the company has done just fine, with its shares rising 52%, outpacing the S&P 500's 22% increase over the same period. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com Part of the reason for the massive equity sale lies in Buffett’s prediction that the capital-gains tax rate will increase over the next several years, possibly to help pay down the federal deficit, which stood at about 122% of the country’s GDP as of 2023. “I would say with present fiscal policies I think that something has to give and I think that higher taxes are quite likely,” Buffett said during Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in May. Vice President Kamala Harris has said that if elected president, she would raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has vowed to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% for companies that produce products in the U.S. While Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway would retain Apple as its largest investment, he added that he wanted to keep more cash on hand.

Eli Lilly’s disappointing quarterly earnings results for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound revealed that the market has some vulnerabilities. And with a projected market potentially worth billions more, the results aren’t likely to deter other pharmas from pursuing their own entries. Pfizer executives are still bullish on the opportunity for its own obesity and diabetes drugs under development, eyeing a potential opening for oral versions and an improved safety profile compared to the GLP-1 drugs currently on the market. While Pfizer isn’t the only pharma giant betting on oral GLP-1s, the company is all in with more than one candidate in the works. And despite two clear leaders in the space — Novo Nordisk and Lilly — supply shortages and other growing pains leave room for new drugs in the coming years. “If there’s a segment worth watching, it’s the oral GLP-1s,” said Puru Gaur, a senior commercial analyst with Norstella. “With a current [market] value just shy of $4 billion, the oral GLP-1 [market] could reach the $20 billion milestone by 2030, representing a high-stakes battleground for pharmaceutical giants.” \"Companies are eager to pour resources into developing better safety profiles, understanding that a differentiated product could be their ticket to sustained market success.” Puru Gaur Senior commercial analyst, Norstella The only oral GLP-1 approved by the FDA so far is Novo’s Rybelsus, which treats type 2 diabetes and brought in roughly $1.6 billion in sales during the first half of 2024. Oral versions of the popular injectable GLP-1s are thought to be more convenient for patients who may not want to use needles. “This gap presents a lucrative opportunity, and the race is on to see which player can capitalize on it first,” Gaur said. Lilly’s oral version, orforglipron, is in phase 3 trials for weight loss. But Pfizer is aiming to be the second pharma company on the market with an approved oral GLP-1 for that indication, with its lead candidate, danuglipron, still in early-stage testing. Second place could still offer a sizable market share. “There is a significant need for oral solutions,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call. “There is no doubt that if successful, we will have a decent market share of oral.” In addition to danuglipron, Pfizer is developing an oral, small molecule GIPR-antagonist that is beginning phase 2 testing this year, and another oral GLP-1 in phase 1, Bourla said during the call. The company’s oral candidates edge toward the upper end of the 10% to 20% weight loss seen with GLP-1s in use today, and Pfizer plans to discuss more about danuglipron, which is currently undergoing dosing trials, in 2025, executives said.

More specific pockets of strong demand include Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and the 5G telecom upgrade cycle, which can benefit companies whose cables and conduits fit those needs. But like the broader industrials sector, these companies are also at the whim of economic cycles. Interest rates, for example, can greatly impact projects that drive demand for these products. A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall business quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Sanmina’s demand was weak over the last five years as its sales fell by 1.2% annually, a rough starting point for our analysis. Long-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Sanmina’s recent history shows its demand has stayed suppressed as its revenue has declined by 2.2% annually over the last two years. Sanmina isn’t alone in its struggles as the Electrical Systems industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses seeing lower sales at this time.                 ",

        "body": "A stock split is when a company decides to exchange its stock for more (and sometimes fewer) shares of its own stock, with the price per share adjusting so that there is no change in the overall value of the company. Many stock splits are greeted by investors as good news, and shares sometimes rise as a result. However, some splits are seen negatively and may push the stock lower. Here’s what you need to know about stock splits and why they’re not usually a big deal. When investors talk about stock splits, they’re usually referring to a forward stock split, but that’s only one of two major kinds of split. Here’s the simple distinction: In a forward stock split, your current shares are exchanged for more shares. In a reverse stock split, your current shares are exchanged for fewer shares. When the split occurs, the share price also changes automatically to reflect the exchange ratio. That is, regardless of which kind of split, you’ll still own the same dollar value in stock as you did before the split. Think of it like slicing a pizza into more slices: The total area of the pizza stays the same, you just have more (smaller) slices that comprise the pizza. Here’s an example to show how it works. Imagine you own 100 shares of a company that’s undertaking a 2-for-1 forward split and is trading at $100 per share before the split. Following the split you would own 200 shares but the price would be adjusted to $50 per share. So you end up with the same $10,000 in dollar value that you had before the stock split. It’s a similar situation with a reverse split. Imagine you own 500 shares of a company that’s undertaking a 1-for-5 reverse split and is trading at $3 per share before the split. Following the split you would own 100 shares but the price would be adjusted to $15 per share. Similarly, you own the same $1,500 in dollar value that you had before the stock split. Most forward stock splits are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, though sometimes you might see a 3-for-2 split. Higher-priced stocks such as Apple may offer a higher exchange ratio, such as the company did in 2020 with its 4-for-1 split or its 7-for-1 split in 2014. Companies may split their stock for a variety of purposes, but they usually have little to do with the fundamental performance of the business. Mostly a stock is split for some or all of these basic reasons: To maintain the stock in a typical trading range. Stocks are normally priced in the range of $20 to $120 or so, and so companies may like to maintain that convention. To make it easier for investors to buy. A lower share price allows investors to buy a share with less money, though with fractional share investing that’s less of a concern. To increase liquidity. A more liquid stock may lower the bid-ask spread on the stock, making it less costly for investors to transact in the stock. To regain compliance with a stock exchange’s rules. A company may use a reverse split to push its stock price back over a certain threshold, typically $1 per share, in order to maintain compliance with an exchange’s rules. To raise the stock price. Some large investors are not allowed to buy stocks trading below a certain price, such as $5 per share. So a penny stock, which is often considered risky, may use a reverse-split to make its stock more acceptable to these investors.                    ",

        "body": "Peloton (PTON) stock jumped nearly 10% Monday before paring gains following an upgrade from Bank of America (BAC). Bank of America analyst Curtis Nagle upgraded the stock to a Buy rating and nearly tripled his price target from $3.75 to $9, citing the fitness company’s recent earnings beat, confidence in its new CEO, and its potential for “substantial earnings upside.” Shares were up 3.6% to $7.51 at market close. Peloton’s jump on Monday extends a multiweek rally, with shares surging more than 60% over the past month as investors signal confidence in the fitness platform's turnaround plan, which includes a major marketing pivot. Peloton’s fiscal first quarter earnings report last week for the period ended Sept. 30 surpassed Wall Street’s forecasts: Its adjusted earnings per share of $0 was better than the loss of $0.16 per share expected by analysts, and its third quarter revenue of $586 million was ahead of the $573 million forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Peloton also announced its new CEO, Apple (AAPL) Fitness+ co-founder and Ford (F) executive Peter Stern, after a months-long search. Stern will take the helm in January 2025. Following Peloton's quarterly earnings report, multiple firms from JPMorgan (JPM) to Bernstein, BMO Capital, Macquarie, Truist, and now Bank of America have raised their price targets on the stock. Analysts cited the platform’s focus on driving profitability and trimming capital expenditures. Bank of America's Nagle said its new CEO “ticks many boxes.” He also said that Bank of America believes Peloton can exceed $300 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the fiscal year 2025, while the company itself set a more modest guidance range between $240 million and $290 million. Peloton shares have plunged from highs around $150 in 2021. The company’s rapid rise — fueled by pandemic at-home workout trends — gave way to a steep, prolonged decline. Customers turned away from the fitness platform, with subscribers falling by about 400,000 between 2022 and 2024. And Peloton’s annual earnings in 2022 and 2023 fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. Stern, who currently serves as president of Ford Integrated Services, “will hopefully provide much-needed direction for the Company’s subscription growth,” said Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman, who maintains her Market-Perform rating on the stock. Overall, analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect shares to hover around $8 over the next year. \"While Peloton is ahead of plan on right-sizing the cost base and improving hardware unit economics, growth remains elusive,\" she wrote in a note on Nov. 1.

Novo Nordisk (NVO), maker of popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is set to report third-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, with Wall Street analysts generally bullish on the Danish drugmaker's stock.

The average price target for the company's shares on its home stock exchange is 963.36 Danish krone (about $140), about 28% over its Monday close. The company could face increased competition in the weight-loss market in coming years. Companies like Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) and AstraZeneca (AZN) this week offered new data for their own weight-loss drugs in various stages of clinical trials. Deutsche Bank analysts said Monday that they believe Novo Nordisk, along with Mounjaro and Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly (LLY), have \"built moats\" that will make it difficult for other companies to scale production enough to challenge their dominant positions in the weight-loss market. Analysts expect Novo Nordisk to report 72.17 billion krone ($10.48 billion) in revenue for the quarter, with Ozempic and Wegovy sales projected to rise 28% and 63%, respectively, from the same time last year.

Tesla stock fell Monday morning, while the others all rose.

        "body": "With this year’s rising popularity of presidential election prediction markets, not only can pollsters predict the outcome of the election, but ordinary investors can too. Robinhood, the latest platform to make its foray into election betting, has raked in over 100 million bets after introducing contracts last week, according to the company’s CEO. “100 million contracts have been traded in less than a week on @robinhoodapp’s Presidential Election Market,” Robinhood CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev posted on X on Sunday. On the Robinhood app, users can watch in real-time as bets are placed and the likelihood of either candidate’s victory adjusts accordingly. At the moment, former President Donald Trump leads with 55% while Vice President Kamala Harris is polling at 46%. Robinhood's betting site appears like this: Robinhood, which lets users trade a wide variety of stocks and crypto assets, introduced U.S. election betting on its mobile app last week. The presidential election contracts are the first event contracts to be offered on its prediction market. In order to place bets, users have to meet certain criteria including being a U.S. citizen and having been approved for a Robinhood Derivatives account. Robinhood’s rollout came after a court in September sided with prediction market Kalshi, which had sued the CFTC to challenge a long standing prohibition on election betting. The ruling opened the door to these contracts in the U.S., leading Kalshi to launch bets on the Presidential race soon after. The new offering attracted $30 million in bets in its first three weeks. The CTFC is appealing the decision which could halt betting, but not until after the 2024 election. Kalshi and Robinhood are not the only prediction markets that offer election betting. Polymarket, a platform that offers contracts in cryptocurrency, and PredictIt have popular contracts too. While Polymarket cannot operate in the United States, its U.S. election prediction market has amassed almost $3 billion worth of volume and had Trump polling around 58% on Monday. However, recent evidence suggests a large portion of trading on the platform is fake. Prediction markets work like this: If Trump has a 55% chance of winning on Robinhood, contracts in favor of Trump will go for $0.55 and users can purchase multiple contracts to increase their winnings – or losses. If Trump wins then you receive $1 for each contract and if he loses you receive $0 for each contract. It is important to note the timeline when purchasing election contracts on Robinhood. While the election is scheduled for November 5th, the outcome of the contracts will not be determined until January 7th and users will not receive a payout until January 8th.

One reason for the relative calm is that bookmaker odds on a Republican \"clean sweep\" of the presidency and both houses of Congress have lengthened compared with last week, with gridlock now the best guess whoever wins the Presidency. That takes some of the edge off fiscal policy worries, even if trade tariff calculations remain in the mix as the president can pursue them independently. Another prosaic reason is stock markets tend to rally once the anxiety of the waiting passes. And then there is also the small matter of a second Federal Reserve interest rate cut of the year on Thursday that's likely to follow either way too. Albeit in more edgier pandemic times, the VIX \"fear index\" index of U.S. stock volatility was some 15 points higher than it is now on the eve of the last tight election in 2020 - and it fell more than 10 points within a week of the contested results. At less than 22 on Tuesday, the VIX is almost half its highest close during the yen-related blowout this August and December VIX futures are four points lower. The real volatility this time around is bond markets, where the Treasury MOVE index is more than twice what it was in 2020 - and at its highest for a year. That said, Treasury yields held steady into the vote at 4.3% and Wall Street stock index futures were steady to firmer too. Many of the recently buoyant \"Trump trades\" backing a win for the Republican candidate - betting on a higher dollar and Bitcoin and weaker Mexican peso and Chinese yuan - remained on the back foot as prediction markets on the outcome are now basically 50-50. But these did steady somewhat after Monday's recoil. While some of the results will start to stream in overnight, it could take days for the result to be clear given the reliance on the handful of swing states that will likely decide the outcome. Perhaps the most important battleground, Pennsylvania, did not have a clear winner in 2020 for four days after election day as officials sifted through a backlog of mail ballots. The state is among only a few that do not permit election workers to process mail ballots until 7 a.m. ET on election day - which means it could take days before the outcome is known. CHINA BOOST World stocks were mostly higher, with Chinese mainland and Hong Kong benchmarks outperforming after news that the country's services activity expanded at the fastest pace in three months in October - an early signs that Beijing's big stimulus push may be improving confidence.

Oil has been the main market mover in recent days, gaining nearly 3% on Monday after OPEC+ said it would delay a planned output hike for a second time. U.S. polling points to an incredibly close contest and gambling markets have tightened odds in recent days, prompting a bit of a trim for wagers in financial markets on a Trump victory or a Republican sweep of Congress and the White House.

Founded to revolutionize thrifting, ThredUp (NASDAQ:TDUP) is a leading online fashion resale marketplace that offers a wide selection of gently-used clothing and accessories. Within apparel and accessories, not only do styles change more frequently today than decades past as fads travel through social media and the internet but consumers are also shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some apparel, accessories, and luxury goods companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind. Reviewing a company’s long-term performance can reveal insights into its business quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one sustains growth for years. Over the last five years, ThredUp grew its sales at a mediocre 14.3% compounded annual growth rate. This shows it couldn’t expand in any major way, a tough starting point for our analysis. Long-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. ThredUp’s recent history shows its demand slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 4% over the last two years is below its five-year trend.           ",

A partnership between Amazon and Talen was rejected by regulators who said it could raise energy prices for customers in the surrounding area. Constellation also reported an earnings beat Monday, as the company will also likely face regulatory questions over its partnership with Microsoft.  Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) tumbled Monday morning despite an earnings beat as a recent regulatory decision dragged nuclear energy stocks. Constellation posted $6.55 billion in revenue for the third quarter, up about 7% year-over-year and about $1 billion above what analysts had expected, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Profits also rose from the same time last year, nearly doubling analyst estimates at $1.2 billion. The company also lifted the bottom end of its projected range for full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS), expecting the metric between $8.00 and $8.40, up from $7.60 to $8.40 previously. However, Constellation shares were down about 8% Monday morning despite its earnings beat as a Friday decision from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised concerns about the nuclear energy industry. The agency ruled against a partnership between Amazon (AMZN) and Talen Energy (TLN) that would see an Amazon data center receive additional power from a nearby Talen nuclear facility, according to Reuters. The panel's members, Reuters reported, said the agreement could limit power and raise prices to residents in the surrounding area. Talen, Constellation, and other nuclear stocks fell Monday as markets grappled with whether nuclear partnerships with Big Tech companies can survive similar challenges. Constellation announced a deal with Microsoft (MSFT) last month to restart one unit of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania to provide power for Microsoft's data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. Constellation and Talen shares were each down as markets opened, but have both still doubled in value since the start of 2024. ",

        "body": "Shares of cable news and media network Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) jumped 5.5% in the morning session after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings that blew past analysts' sales and EPS expectations. The top line benefited from a 6% year on year growth in affiliate revenue, largely driven by a 10% growth in the Television business. The advertising business did even better, growing 11% year on year due to higher political advertising revenues at FOX Television. This highlights FOXA's ability to optimize its ad inventory, given the audience growth powered by its relatable content during the election season. Other relevant factors explaining the improved growth include higher ratings and pricing, growth at Tubi (FOX's streaming platform), and the impact of sports revenues such as broadcasts of the UEFA European Championship and CONMEBOL Copa América. The broad-based sales improvement flowed to the bottom line as the company's EBITDA exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Overall, this was a strong quarter, highlighting significant improvements across the board. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $42.97, up 2.7% from previous close. Is now the time to buy FOX? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. FOX’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 2 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. FOX is up 42.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $42.97 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of FOX’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,320.

        "body": "Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) reversed earlier losses to close Monday's trading session about 12% higher as shares brace for another volatile week on Wall Street just one day ahead of the presidential election. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday. And since Tuesday, more than $3 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows. Volatility in the stock is expected to continue. One investor has warned that if Trump loses the election on Tuesday, shares of DJT could plunge to $0. \"It's a binary bet on the election,\" Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, recently told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. Tuttle, who currently owns put options on the stock, said the trajectory of shares hinges on \"a buy the rumor, sell the fact\" trading strategy. \"I would imagine that the day after him winning, you'd see this come down,\" he surmised. \"If he loses, I think it goes to zero.\" Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock \"life of its own.\" \"It was volatile on the way up and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction,\" he said in a call with Yahoo Finance last week. Prior to the recent sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen in recent weeks as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican. And as betting markets tighten, national polls show both candidates in a virtually deadlocked race. Polls in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which are likely to decide the fate of the election, also show razor-thin margins. In September, the stock traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had also been under pressure as previous polling in September saw Harris with a bigger lead on the former president.         ",

Analysts say the treatment, which is being tested in both oral and injectable forms, would be \"very costly\" to attempt to scale production of both versions if they are approved. The oral version caused placebo-adjusted average weight loss of up to 6.8% in a recent trial, Viking said Monday.  Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) shares fell Monday, handing back early gains, as analysts questioned the path ahead for its developmental weight-loss drugs even after news of upbeat results in clinical trials. The company's weight loss drug, which is being tested in oral and injectable forms, led to placebo-adjusted average weight loss of up to 6.8% of a patient's body weight in a recent trial of the oral version, Viking said Monday as part of an industry conference. JPMorgan analysts earlier this identified the conference as a likely catalyst for Viking shares, with production and sale of the treatment likely several clinical trials and years away. Viking shares, which rose premarket, were recently down about 11% — though they remain up more than 250% this year so far. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote Monday that they believe it will be \"very costly\" for Viking to build the capacity to produce both oral and injectable versions of the drug in multiple dosage sizes. That cost and timeline, they wrote, means current weight loss giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) have \"built moats\" that will make it more difficult for Viking and others to compete. Previous trials of Viking's drugs have substantially lifted its shares multiple times this year — and, at times, sent Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk stocks lower over concerns that their weight-loss dominance could be challenged.

The Dow tracks the stock performance of 30 large, blue chip companies. Here are the details on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, including which companies are included in the index and how it is calculated. The following 30 companies are included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as of Nov. 8, 2024: 3M (MMM) Amazon.com (AMZN) American Express (AXP) Amgen (AMGN) Apple (AAPL) Boeing (BA) Caterpillar (CAT) Chevron (CVX) Cisco Systems (CSCO) Coca-Cola (KO) Goldman Sachs (GS) Home Depot (HD) Honeywell International (HON) International Business Machines (IBM) Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) JPMorgan Chase (JPM) McDonald’s (MCD) Merck & Co. (MRK) Microsoft (MSFT) Nike (NKE) Nvidia (NVDA) Procter & Gamble (PG) Salesforce (CRM) Sherwin-Williams (SHW) Travelers (TRV) UnitedHealth Group (UNH) Verizon Communications (VZ) Visa (V) Walmart (WMT) Walt Disney (DIS) *Note: Nvidia and Sherwin-Williams will replace Intel and Dow in the index before trading begins on Nov. 8, 2024. In order to be included in the Dow, a company must be part of the S&P 500 and cannot be part of the transportation or utilities industries (S&P Dow Jones Indices has other indexes that track these areas of the economy). The S&P 500 itself has several requirements around things such as the company’s market capitalization, where the stock trades, profitability and trading volume. Finally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is maintained by a committee that includes three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two representatives from The Wall Street Journal. Because the Dow is limited to 30 companies, when one company enters the index, another must leave. In November 2024, it was announced that Nvidia and Sherwin-Williams would replace Intel and Dow Inc. in the index. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which means the stocks are weighted in the index based on their share price. This can create some unique situations, such as a company with a smaller market cap than other companies in the index having a larger weight because its share price is higher. Stock splits have a particularly large impact on price-weighted indexes for this reason. For example, Apple is one of the largest companies in the world and, as of November 2024, has the largest weight in the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 based on its market cap of $3.35 trillion. But in the Dow, it has just the 13th largest weight, which is based on its share price of about $221. UnitedHealth Group has the largest weight in the Dow because of its $559 share price despite having a market cap that is less than 20 percent of Apple’s.       ",

Throughout the course of the 2024 U.S. presidential race, technology policy debates centered around AI. But regulatory concerns over consolidation in the massive and growing market for the infrastructure supporting AI — cloud compute services — remain unresolved. Neither candidate has taken a public stance on cloud market competition. However, a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into the issue in March 2023 remains open. When the inquiry began, FTC Chair Lina Khan pointed to security risks posed by consolidation among providers and growing dependency on hyperscale infrastructure across several key industries, including healthcare, finance and transportation. The agency later expanded the scope of the inquiry to include AI with Khan noting that cloud is a “key input” for the technology. The FTC had AI and its cloud dependency in its sights again in January, when the agency ordered five companies — Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI — to provide details of investments and partnerships pertaining to the two technologies. “Our study will shed light on whether investments and partnerships pursued by dominant companies risk distorting innovation and undermining fair competition,\" Khan said in the announcement. It will be up to the new administration to determine the trajectory of the FTC’s regulatory efforts and its impact on cloud. “If Lina Khan still chairs the FTC, there likely will be follow-up,” Steven Ward, resident privacy and security fellow on the cybersecurity and emerging threats team at R Street Institute, said in an email. Ward pointed to Khan's remarks at a January FTC Tech Summit as an indication of policy direction. While she focused primarily on the rapid deployment of AI, she said the agency was taking “a close look across the AI stack” to determine whether the dominant cloud providers were positioned to block competition. AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud have long commanded the market, and in Q3 they controlled nearly two-thirds of the cloud infrastructure market and 68% of public cloud services, according to Synergy Research Group. The three big hyperscalers have raced to infuse their platforms with large language model technologies and solidify alliances with key AI developers like OpenAI and Anthropic. Cloud is where models are trained, tools are deployed and users gain access to AI solutions.      ",

Shares have fallen roughly 30% since the start of 2024, but analysts largely believe CVS will be able to recover some of its stock losses going forward. Last month, the pharmacy chain and health-care provider faced reports that it was considering breaking up its business and installed a new CEO.  CVS Health (CVS) will report third-quarter earnings before the market opens Wednesday after the pharmacy and health-care provider had a rocky October that included a CEO change and layoffs, among other cost-cutting moves. Despite its roughly 30% drop since the start of the year, the 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha remain largely bullish on CVS stock, with nine \"buy\" ratings and four \"hold\" ratings. However, the average target price of $68.69 implies that analysts expect CVS to recover some—but not all—of its losses since the start of 2024. The stock closed Monday at $54.65, down 2%. Revenue is projected to rise to $93.02 billion for the quarter, a bump of about 3.6% year-over-year. But net income is expected to fall by more than 40% to $1.29 billion, or $1.05 per share, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. CVS reports its latest earnings following a turbulent October, which started with reports that a breakup of its namesake pharmacies and Aetna health insurance provider was being considered after its earnings in the first two quarters of 2024 disappointed and it repeatedly cut profit projections. Weeks after it was reported that the company met with hedge fund Glenview Capital Management to discuss potential changes to its operations, CVS on Oct. 18 said company veteran David Joyner would take over as chief executive officer (CEO). The company at that time also released preliminary third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) projections of 3 cents to 8 cents and said it would provide new full-year guidance on Wednesday's earnings call.

Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are locked in a tight race, fueling uncertainty among traders. One analyst said economic fundamentals matter more to markets than who becomes president. Market analysts are braced for volatility ahead of Tuesday's presidential election as traders shuffled their bets on a Donald Trump or Kamala Harris victory. The Republican and Democratic candidates are neck and neck in many polls, fueling uncertainty in the finance world over who'll emerge triumphant, and clouding the outlook for everything from tax and trade policy to corporate regulation and geopolitics. One analyst underscored the critical importance of the election in research notes on Monday, while another touted economic fundamentals as more important to markets and predicted long-term investors would likely win over time. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, while China's central bank is set to unveil some form of economic stimulus measures later this week. Here's a roundup of analysts' comments: \"US and European stock futures are trading flat as traders continue to focus on one thing and one thing alone, and that is the US elections. Basically, there is nothing else that matters; it is not going to be earnings that would move things in the markets, and it won't be the US jobs noisy number that would make traders think about the US economy. The only thing that is going to keep them occupied is the US election and who will become the next president of the most powerful country in the world.\" \"A shift in the polls seen over the weekend signal the potential for a Harris victory in Iowa; with a surge in the older female demographic signaling a shift that many believe could carry Harris to victory. Coming at a time when markets appeared to have taken a Trump victory as a given, the polls are a timely reminder that betting markets may not be the best indication of who will become the President of the United States. \"The election looks significantly more of a contest than many had been expecting, which could provide a more protracted and volatile period ahead as we see potential recounts and challenges to potentially drag out this process.\" \"Despite short-term volatility, historical trends reveal that equities have consistently posted strong gains by the end of a presidential term, underscoring the benefits of maintaining a long-term investment perspective.

Today we are looking at Estée Lauder (NYSE:EL) and the best and worst performers in the consumer staples industry. The consumer staples industry comprises companies engaged in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of essential, everyday products. These products, also known as \"staples,\" are fundamental to daily living and include packaged food, beverages and alcohol, personal care, and household products. Consumer staples stocks are considered defensive investments because consumers often purchase them regardless of economic conditions. To stand out, companies must have some combination of brand recognition, product quality, and price competitiveness. The 33 consumer staples stocks we track reported a mixed Q3. As a group, revenues were in line with analysts’ consensus estimates while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 10.1% below. In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results. Named after its founder, who was an entrepreneurial woman from New York with a passion for skincare, Estée Lauder (NYSE:EL) is a one-stop beauty shop with products in skincare, fragrance, makeup, sun protection, and men’s grooming. Estée Lauder reported revenues of $3.36 billion, down 4.5% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ earnings estimates but revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations. Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “Our first quarter results are largely aligned with our outlook on an adjusted basis, despite the fact that the expected headwinds in China and Asia travel retail were greater than anticipated. Our Profit Recovery and Growth Plan drove gross margin expansion, which was partially offset by operating deleverage. Other pillars of our strategic reset also delivered promising initial results. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 23.3% since reporting and currently trades at $66.84. Is now the time to buy Estée Lauder? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.

A victory for Donald Trump could push the precious metal up further, given he’s pledging a massive increase in trade tariffs that may fuel inflation. However, the closeness of the race means the final result may not be known for days. Bullion has surged by around a third this year, and is about $50 an ounce below last week’s record high. It’s been supported by easier monetary policy, central-bank buying and heightened geopolitical tensions. The Fed is widely expected to cut rates by a quarter-point on Thursday, with many of its rich world peers also likely to lower borrowing costs.

While stocks certainly have recently shown signs of investor uncertainty, they've largely plowed higher since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic Party ticket in late July, save for a week of historic volatility tied to events in Japan in early August. Don't miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet's FREE daily newsletter In fact, the S&P 500 has risen more than 10% since that yen-linked volatility spike shook global markets. And it notched only a modest 1.37% decline last week after a mixed set of mega-cap tech results and some mildly hot inflation data, even as polls continue to indicate a dead heat, with some 11th-hour momentum for Harris into the final stretch. Related: Fed interest rate decision and election may roil stocks \"Equity investors have maintained a bullish narrative anchored to an economic soft landing, achievement of the Fed’s inflation mandate, and thus a regular rate-cutting cycle, and a Republican sweep of the White House and Congress, while further assuming that the earnings growth rate will eventually accelerate to double digits,\" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer and head of the global investment office at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Image source: TheStreet Bond markets, however, have whipsawed in a way that has unsettled investors worldwide. Benchmark 10-year note yields, the very scaffolding of global financial markets, have risen an unprecedented 80 basis points in the face of not only an outsized half-point Federal Reserve interest-rate cut but also signals of an aggressive path of follow-on reductions from Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues. The Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate, otherwise known as the MOVE index and the bond market's key volatility gauge has soared more than 43% to the highest levels in more than a year since the late September Fed cut and data suggesting former Trump's lead in swing-state polls. Traders have cited a combination of better-than-expected economic data, including a flash third-quarter GDP estimate of 2.8%, modestly quickening inflation pressures, and rate cuts in key markets around the world as contributing to the bond market selloff.

The stock had consolidated within a broadening formation leading into the company's quarterly results, but bulls have successfully defended the pattern’s lower trendline, with trading volume registering its highest level since early October on Monday. Investors should watch key overhead levels on Palantir's chart around $45 and $60, while also monitoring an important zone of support during periods of profit-taking between $41 and $38.  Palantir (PLTR) shares traded sharply higher in extended trading on Monday after the analytics software provider topped third-quarter estimates and lifted its full-year revenue outlook amid robust demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings. In particular, the company pointed out AI demand from government and commercial customers, adding that it expects the rapid adoption of its platforms and AI capabilities to drive future growth. Palantir shares have gained more than two-fold since the start of the year as of Monday’s close, boosted in part by the stock’s recent inclusion into the large cap S&P 500 index. Palantir shares gained 14% to $47.09 in after-hours trading Monday. Below, we analyze the technicals on Palantir’s chart and identify important post-earnings price levels to watch out for. Since breaking out above a flag pattern in early September, Palantir shares trended sharply higher for about a month before consolidating within a broadening formation. Leading into the company’s quarterly results, sellers moved into the stock, but bulls successfully defended the formation's lower trendline, with trading volume registering its highest level since early October on Monday. Amid the stock’s projected earnings-driven breakout above the broadening formation on Tuesday, let’s identify several key overhead levels investors may be watching and point out an important zone of support to monitor during periods of profit-taking. The first sits around $45. Although the stock sits poised to open above this level on Tuesday, it’s worth watching for a close above this price located near the stock’s all-time high (ATH) and the broadening formation's top trendline. To project an overhead price target above the stock’s ATH, we can use a bars pattern, a chart technique that uses prior price action to predict future moves. In this case, we take Palantir’s trending move from September to October and overlay it from the broadening formation's lower trendline, which forecasts a target of around $60.     ",

The deal would permit a Talen nuclear plant to provide an Amazon data center with extra power. Nuclear stocks have surged this year as AI data centers boost energy demand. Nuclear-power stocks slumped on Monday after US regulators barred a plant from supplying extra power to an Amazon data center. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected the deal between Amazon and Talen Energy late last week. According to FERC Commissioner Mark Christie, approving the proposal would spark consequences for grid reliability and consumer costs. Talen dropped as much as 8.6% on Monday, unleashing a broader downturn in the nuclear power sector. Vistra slid 6.7% at intraday lows, while Constellation Energy tanked 13%. These firms have gained sharply as AI data centers have driven US power demand to new heights. In recent months, tech companies have come to embrace nuclear power to run these centers, fueling underlying equities. Both Vistra and Constellation are among the top S&P 500 performers this year. In a similar fashion to Talen, Constellation reached a 20-year deal with Microsoft to power its data center in But the FERC's decision sets a precedent that could challenge nuclear data center deals. \"FERC's decision will have a chilling effect on economic development in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Jersey,\" Talen said in a statement. According to Bloomberg, the firm was already paid $650 million in March by Amazon Web Services for a data center campus next to the Pennsylvania plant at issue. AWS also signed a long-term deal to purchase power from the plant. Other nuclear equities also suffered on Monday, with the Sam Altman-backed firm Oklo and Nano Nuclear Energy both falling by double-digits. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround In the run-up to Tuesday’s vote, equity traders decided to stay on the sidelines as a flurry of polls showed Americans remain narrowly split between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The likelihood of a disputed result could eventually drag the vote count out for weeks or even months. For many, that means one thing — a potential increase in volatility. Treasuries rose across the curve and the dollar dropped the most in over a month. Another factor that’s preventing traders from making riskier bets is the number of additional catalysts surrounding the vote. Election Day will quickly be followed on Thursday by the Fed decision and Jerome Powell’s press conference, where he’ll give details on the central bank’s interest-rate path. And a big chunk of US companies are still due to report their earnings. “Normally, the Fed rate announcement would dominate the week’s discussion, but this isn’t just any week,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “Traders and investors who have been waiting for the outcome of the election have to prepare themselves for the possibility of a delayed outcome, and the potential impact of that.” Regarding equity performance, the S&P 500 tends to see positive returns to close out the year after Election Day, according to Bespoke Investment Group. For all years since 1990, the median gain has been 3.3%. For election years, performance has tended to be modestly stronger, with a median gain of 3.9%. The S&P 500 fell 0.3%. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.6%. In late hours, Palantir Technologies Inc. rallied on an earnings beat, while citing “unwavering” artificial-intelligence demand. NXP Semiconductors NV tumbled after giving a disappointing forecast. Treasury 10-year yields declined nine basis points to 4.29%. Bitcoin fell 2.6%.

        "body": "Constellation Energy stock (CEG) fell 12.5% Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a proposal from a grid operator, PJM, to ramp up the amount of power supplied through the grid from Talen Energy (TLN) to an Amazon (AMZN) artificial intelligence data center. Talen said in a statement on Sunday it believes the FERC \"erred\" in its ruling, adding the company is \"evaluating our options, with a focus on commercial solutions.\" Talen Energy dropped 2.2%, while Sam Altman-backed Oklo (OKLO) fell 2.8%, Centrus Energy (LEU) tumbled 28.8%, NANO Nuclear (NNE) dropped 12.8%, Vistra (VST) sank 3.2%, and NuScale Power (SMR) fell 2.8%. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Big Tech’s interest in nuclear energy has risen substantially as companies look to meet growing demand from power-hungry data centers to run generative artificial intelligence software without falling behind on their climate goals. Amazon, Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. Constellation entered into a 20-year deal with Microsoft in late September to supply power to one of its AI data centers. The stock is up 36% from three months ago, as the Microsoft deal and Big Tech’s growing interest in nuclear power have sent shares soaring. Constellation Energy also on Monday reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.74, ahead of Wall Street’s forecast of $2.65, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Its quarterly revenue of $6.6 billion also surpassed the $5.2 billion expected by analysts. “The importance of AI and the data economy to America’s economic competitiveness and national security can’t be overstated, and Constellation will do our part to meet the moment,” Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez said in a statement Monday. Still, red tape plagues the industry. Nuclear projects have been subject to stringent regulations in response to high-profile global nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011. On average, it takes the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 80 months to approve nuclear plant construction in the US, according to research cited by Canaccord Genuity. The FERC said in its filing Friday that it rejected the Amazon nuclear power agreement due in part to concerns that it could threaten the reliability of the power grid and raise energy costs for the public.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell by about the same amount. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, falling about 250 points, or 0.6%. Monday's session was choppy ahead of Tuesday's election, a big risk event for markets. The new president — whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump — will set the course for the economy in the years that follow. The neck-and-neck race has investors bracing for volatility on Election Day itself. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Weekend polls showed Harris with a shock lead in Iowa and gaining ground elsewhere — a sign the Democrat has a better chance of winning than Wall Street had calculated. The dollar dropped by the most in a month as traders recalculated bets on a Trump victory. Treasury yields also retreated, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) sliding almost 10 basis points to about 4.30%. Also looming large is the Fed's two-day policy meeting, kicking off a day later than usual on Wednesday in light of the election. Wall Street is convinced that Chair Jerome Powell will usher in a 0.25% rate cut on Thursday, despite signs of stubborn inflation and muddied job market signals. Given that, the focus is on what action the Fed might take at future meetings, with the market now seeing three fewer cuts through the end of 2025 than it previously expected.

Stocks fell during a choppy trading session on Monday ahead of the US presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down 0.6%, or roughly 270 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closed down 0.3% after switching between positive and negative territories throughout the session. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) closed slightly higher but off its session high in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow on Friday. \"Trump trades\" were volatile during the session, with Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closing out the session 12% higher despite an Iowa poll over the weekend showing his contender, Vice President Kamala Harris, ahead of former president Trump. The markets were choppy on Monday as investors braced for Tuesday's US presidential election. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson made some predictions on which sectors could lead, depending on the outcome. In a Republican sweep scenario, in which Donald Trump wins and his party maintains control of the House and also gains the Senate, cyclicals such as Financials, Industrials, and commodity-sensitive industries could outperform and take the major averages higher, provided Treasury yields stay somewhat contained in the days following the outcome, Wilson and his team said. \"Conversely, if the move higher in yields is more material and is driven by a rising term premium due to fiscal sustainability concerns, we would expect more of a risk-off posture like the summer/fall of 2023,\" Wilson wrote. If Vice President Kamala Harris wins and Congress is divided, Wilson sees \"tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables outperforming in the short term\" while Financials, Industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform initially. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 1% to hover around $67,800 on Monday as investors braced for the US presidential election on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency has been viewed as a beneficiary if Donald Trump were to win the White House. The token moved beyond $72,000 last week, only to retreat after an Iowa poll over the weekend showed Vice President Kamala Harris leapfrogging ahead of Trump. The former president has said in the past he will create a \"bitcoin national stockpile\" if reelected to the White House. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped into green territory by 1:45 p.m Eastern on Monday in what has shaped up to be a choppy session. The tech-heavy index switched between positive and negative since early morning trading. Nvidia (NVDA) stock was helping lift the major average in anticipation of its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) later this week. The AI chip heavyweight climbed more than 2% during the session. Yahoo Finance's Grace Williams reports: The 2024 presidential election is a day away, and with both candidates polling closely, speculation about a second Trump administration now heavily involves Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.

Real Estate (XRE) and Materials (XLB) also rose while Utilities (XLU), Financials (XLF) and Healthcare (XLV) dipped. Stocks moved to session lows by mid-session on Monday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropping 0.4% after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Russia plotted to send incendiary devices on planes headed to the US and Canada. The report cited Western officials who said the devices that ignited in Europe were part of a plot to put them on cargo or passenger planes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) flipped from positive to negative territory to drop 0.3% immediately following the report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 400 points, or almost 1%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% Monday as analysts pointed to rising chip sales and mounting spending on AI infrastructure. That jump helped the AI chipmaker reach a $3.40 trillion market cap, according to Yahoo Finance data, again overtaking Apple's (AAPL) roughly $3.35 trillion. Apple shares traded slightly lower midday, down 0.5%. Nvidia had last dethroned Apple a little over a week ago, but Apple briefly retook the crown — before its earnings weighed on the stock. Nvidia's rise comes after a week of ups and downs, as Big Tech's earnings shone a spotlight on AI capital expenditures. Investors fear that spending coud ease in the coming years as infrastructure projects reach completion, weighing on AI chipmakers. Wall Street analysts have largely remained bullish on AI hardware stocks, seeing infrastructure spending by Big Tech continuing to rise. Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill said Monday that they expect Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) to spend a combined $292 billion on AI capital expenditures in 2025, representing an 88% increase from 2023 expenses. Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note Monday that global semiconductor sales grew 7.6% in September — \"a bit above typical\" — from the prior month. Rasgon said of Nvidia: \"The datacenter opportunity is enormous, and still early, with material upside still possible.\" Peloton (PTON) shares rose 9% on Monday after Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a Buy from Neutral amid optimism over the fitness equipment maker's new leadership. \"Peloton's new CEO Peter Stern does not have public company CEO experience but meets all the criteria set by Peloton's board\" including consumer software and hardware experience and subscription services, the analysts wrote. Stern, an avid Peloton user who comes from Ford (F), will start his CEO role on Jan. 1. Constellation Energy (CEG) stock fell as much as 12% early Monday amid a broader decline in nuclear power stocks following the US government's rejection of another Big Tech nuclear power agreement late Friday.

Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Read the full story here. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) fell around 2% in early trading on Monday after initially opening the day in the green. Shares are bracing for another volatile week on Wall Street just one day ahead of the presidential election. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday. And since Tuesday, more than $4 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock still has more than doubled from its September lows. Prior to the recent sell-off, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had risen in recent weeks as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican. Read more here. US stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for this week's US elections and a Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) opened near the flat line, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped about 50 points. Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose more than 1% at the open on news that the artificial intelligence chip heavyweight will enter the Dow on Friday, replacing chip giant Intel (INTC). Energy (XLE) stocks also gained on Monday amid surging oil prices. Investors are focused on Tuesday's highly anticipated US presidential election, as well as on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets largely anticipate policymakers will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Affordability concerns are locking more potential first-time homebuyers out of the housing market. A new report showed that first-time homebuyers made up 24% of all buyers this year, marking the lowest share since 1981, according to data from the 2024 National Association of Realtors (NAR) profile of home buyers and sellers. High home prices, elevated borrowing costs, and low inventory have hammered affordability over the past year, leaving many first-time buyers on the fence about purchasing a home. In July, the NAR surveyed over 167,000 recent homebuyers, who said the barriers to entry remained challenging. “In the time frame surveyed, mortgage interest rates jumped to nearly 8%, and housing affordability reduced to historical lows. Home buyers continued to struggle with housing inventory,” NAR’s deputy chief economist Jessica Lautz told Yahoo Finance. “At the same time, rental prices were rising and after a student debt pause, borrowers had to resume payments, making it difficult to save for a downpayment,” Lautz added. Mortgage rates have jumped to between 6% to 7% this year — and now average mortgage rates are rising after hitting a two-year low in September. Meanwhile, entry-level buyers may also be bidding against those making all-cash offers. “If a buyer was on solid financial footing to enter the buying market and there were multiple offers, there is a chance they were up against an all-cash offer,” Lautz said. Oil futures jumped more than 2.5% on Monday after OPEC+, a group of major oil producers, announced it would delay unwinding production cuts by a month. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to trade above $71 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $75 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other countries, said it would continue with its output cuts for one month until the end of 2024. The decision to delay adding 180,000 million barrels per day starting in December had already been postponed in recent months amid volatile oil prices.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index can keep climbing into the final stretch of 2024, with a 5% gain from here not out of the question, as investors exhale after the US presidential election passes and year-end FOMO kicks in, according to Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson.

Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Muddling the Message Around ‘Climate Havens’ But with no clear catalysts in sight, that enthusiasm is likely to fade as the calendar turns to 2025, the strategist warns. “I think we could see 6,000, potentially, in some sort of a clearing event, where there’s not a lot of consternation and people feel good about things,” Morgan’s chief US equity strategist said Monday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. That would imply a nearly 5% gain from where the US equity benchmark’s Friday close at around 5,728. Wilson then added the gauge could rise to as high as 6,100, but that it would not top that level “in any scenario” this year due to stretched valuations and growth unlikely to accelerate in a way that multiples can expand further heading into 2025. The S&P 500 just logged its first down month since April after a string of lackluster earnings reports from some of the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks that have driven the index’s rally. While traders remain on edge with the US presidential election on Tuesday and the Federal Reserve rates decision on Thursday, Wall Street forecasters are largely betting that the stock market can resume its advance once it clears those obstacles. READ: Harris, Trump Hit Battlegrounds as Polls Signal Tight Finish “I could see a blow-off move if some kind post election,” Wilson said. “And then reality sets in, and we have to have some type of fiscal consolidation no matter who wins. And that’s going to create uncertainty again.” The US presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump comes down to the wire on Tuesday, with polls showing the candidates in a dead heat both nationally and across the pivotal swing states that will decide the election. “I do not agree with the view that a Republican sweep is the best outcome for equities,” Wilson said. “I think it’s probably Trump with a divided Congress. Markets like uncertainty. They don’t like one party in power.” The strategist sees a Trump presidency as “probably more pro-growth.” If Trump wins, he said, cyclical stocks such as financials and industrials should outperform, while a Harris presidency would provide a little less growth and probably be better for bonds.

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Muddling the Message Around ‘Climate Havens’ The roadblocks mean re-listing the contracts in the first half of next year as initially planned is unrealistic and “2025 at this stage is probably quite challenged,” said Jennifer Eason, a senior product manager for rates at ASX Ltd. in Sydney. “Things would need to move and progress in a positive direction very quickly to hit that milestone.” New Zealand banks are reluctant to provide live and executable pricing feeds for the futures contracts at least partly to protect their own swaps businesses, Eason said in an interview. Meanwhile, the limited depth of the inter-dealer market makes it hard to guarantee investors can exit their positions easily, she said. Despite the challenges, Australia’s bourse is looking to re-introduce New Zealand government bond futures at some point to meet increasing hedging demand from global investors after the kiwi debt market was included in a key FTSE Russell index in 2022. Australia’s exchange operator de-listed the product five years ago due to lack of liquidity, meaning investors currently have to hedge using swaps. New Zealand’s banks are generally supportive of the re-listing of the futures as it would boost their market and give access to more sophisticated and accurate ways to hedge, even though it may impact their swaps businesses, Eason said. Swaps are customized contracts traded in the over-the-counter market, while banks get commissions by matching the counterparties. Overseas investors currently own more than 60% of New Zealand’s outstanding government debt. “That’s the conundrum that we’ve got here,” Eason said. “It’s progress for a financial market, versus what we currently have, which is quite lucrative.” Subscribe to The Bloomberg Australia Podcast on Apple, Spotify, on YouTube, or wherever you listen. A survey conducted by ASX in November 2023 found 79% of respondents supported the re-listing of New Zealand government bond futures, believing that would help boost liquidity and enhance yield curve transparency of the nation’s debt market.

The surge followed reports that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko proposed potash production cuts in an effort to boost prices. The move could help Mosaic, which stands to benefit from rising prices that might stem from potential potash production cuts.  Shares of fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) jumped over 5% on Monday, posting the strongest performance of any stock in the S&P 500 following reports Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko proposed potash production cuts in an effort to boost prices. Lukashenko reportedly met Monday with Andrey Rybakov, new chief executive officer (CEO) of Belaruskali, the Eastern European nation's largest potash fertilizer company, and suggested approaching potash producers in Russia to coordinate cutting production of the potassium-rich chemicals and minerals by 10% to 11%. The move could lead to higher prices, benefitting Mosaic, with Belarus and Russia jointly accounting for around 40% of global potash exports. Shares of Mosaic climbed 5.4% to finish at $28.33 Monday, though even with Monday's gains, they've lost more than one-fifth of their value since the start of the year. Mosaic's stock price has been under pressure in recent months, with the company warning in September that \"sustained operational challenges\"—including electrical equipment failures at two mines in Saskatchewan, Canada—would reduce its potash production and shipment volumes by 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes in the third quarter. Mosaic is set to report third-quarter results before markets open on Nov. 12. ",

US government debt will also continue to rise, limiting the Fed's ability to cut rates, he said. The stock market could be bumping up against a ceiling for now, market veteran Ed Yardeni said. The longtime investor and president of Yardeni Research said he sees limited capacity for central bankers to cut interest rates, thanks to the strength of the US economy and a troubling outlook for the federal debt balance. That means further policy easing may not come until 2025 — and the S&P 500 could stay stuck around 5,800 through the end of the year, he said in a recent note to clients. That would imply less than a 1% gain for the benchmark index in the next two months. Stocks have already been going \"nowhere fast\" since the Fed issued a jumbo-sized rate cut in September, Yardeni said. The S&P 500 has climbed 2% since the Fed's last policy meeting, while the S&P 500 equal-weighted index has risen 3.8%. \"We expect that it might go nowhere fast over the rest of this year too, hovering around 5,800. The outlook for fiscal policy will probably remain unsettling after the election and the Fed might not lower the FFR over the rest of this year after all,\" Yardeni wrote. Yardeni pointed to strength in recent economic data, which suggests that further rate cuts might not come out of the Fed's meeting this week or in December. For one, real GDP growth was strong in the third quarter, rising 2.8% year-over-year. Business equipment investment rose 11% over the third quarter, following a near-10% increase in the prior quarter. Investment in information processing equipment, in particular, hit a record high, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Weakness in the job market has concerned some investors, with the US adding far fewer payrolls than expected in October. Yet, analysts have said the labor market weakness was at least partly the result of events including union strikes and Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Importantly, the unemployment rate remained near a historic low last month at 4.1%. \"The bond market agrees with our opinion that the Fed cut the FFR too much, too soon,\" Yardeni added, pointing to the recent rise in bond yields, which indicate higher interest rate expectations among bond investors. Government borrowing, meanwhile, looks poised to increase over the coming months, a factor economists have said could indirectly fuel inflation, and therefore limit the Fed's ability to cut rates.

Year-to-date, the trend has been strongly upward, and even last Friday’s lukewarm October jobs report (only 12,000 net new positions reported) didn’t derail the day’s trading. In fact, the poor jobs numbers have market watchers more certain than ever that the Fed will cut rates again this month, and possibly in December, too – which will be supportive of equities. Watching these conflicting currents, the team at Goldman Sachs sees reason to stay in the stock market, and to diversify holdings. Move beyond the mega-cap tech firms, and look for strength in the fundamental sectors: industry, finance, building, and energy. The bank sums it up in the ‘conviction list’ for November 2024, writing, “Our strategists are calling for a broadening of the market beyond mega-cap Tech as the post-pandemic echo-boom matures amidst a rate cutting cycle… Looking at the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 for October we find a very diverse group of companies from a wide range of sectors from industrials to consumer, financials and more… This outperformance highlights just how much alpha is still sitting out there in a market trading at a 2025 P/E of 21.7X… A solid (albeit not spectacular) 3Q earnings season, so far, is contributing to the diverse stock performance and the broader uptick in equities…” Goldman Sachs analysts are turning this stance into specific stock picks, naming some interesting choices on the firm’s Conviction List – choices that could outperform the S&P 500 going forward. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve looked up the details on two of their favorites. Let’s dive in. Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH) The first stock we’ll look at, Meritage Homes, comes from the construction industry, where it is ranked among the top five homebuilders in the US market. Meritage has been in business since 1985, and from its base in Scottsdale, Arizona, oversees operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah. The company specializes in affordable homes, both entry-level targeted at first-time buyers and first move-up homes for homeowners looking to expand. The company has a solid reputation for building energy-efficient homes, with distinctive styling and quality construction. Since its founding, Meritage has delivered over 190,000 completed homes to its customers. The company reported Q3 earnings last week. Revenue reached $1.59 billion, a figure that was down 1.2% year-over-year, but met Street expectations. Meritage dialed in EPS of $5.34, an 11% decline vs. the prior year period but 37 cents per share better than had been anticipated. Meritage closed on 3,942 homes during the quarter, and reported 3Q orders for 3,512 homes.

Trump Media, which trades under the stock tucker DJT, opened Tuesday—Election Day—at $37 a share, up 8.5% from Monday’s closing price. The stock continued to rally on Tuesday, trading at over $40 a share by mid-afternoon. Then suddenly the stock started to fall precipitously, dropping 15% in 15 minutes. Over the course of 14 minutes, from 2:48 p.m. to 3:03 p.m., trading on the stock was halted three separate times because of excess volatility. The pauses in trading came because there were too many shares changing hands at once, causing the price to oscillate wildly in the span of just a few minutes. The first pause came at 2:48 p.m. when the price dropped from $37 to $34 in about a minute. After a five-minute pause meant to cool off the market and avoid a total sell-off, the stock resumed selling at 2:53 p.m. It was paused again about 90 seconds later. Once the second pause was lifted, the stock lasted only marginally longer—115 seconds—before trading was stopped for a third time. After the market closed on Tuesday Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns the social-media platform Truth Social, reported earnings for the third quarter. The company continued to operate with huge losses and small revenues. Trump Media had $1 million in revenue that amounted to a net loss of $19.2 million, according to SEC filings. Those losses compounded existing financial struggles that have persisted since the start of the year. In the first three quarters of 2024 Trump Media had losses of $363.2 million, with total revenue of $2.6 million. Trump Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal business hours. The stock for Trump Media has often moved independently of financial results, instead changing in concert with the political fortunes of its largest shareholder: former President Donald Trump. Throughout the race, it often moved alongside Trump’s election odds. When it seemed like Trump was poised to run away with the race following the first assassination attempt on his life in July, the stock soared. In September, after Vice President Kamala Harris trounced Trump in the debate, shares plunged. With Election Day here, traders were poised to make their final play on the stock, whose future value hinges on whether Trump will make it back to the White House. Election Day saw 143 million shares, with about an hour still to go before the market closed, according to data from Refinitiv. The run-up to Election Day saw exorbitant trading activity on the stock, likely from eager traders looking to ride the rising share price to some quick gains and from those who already owned and were hoping to cash out before voters rendered their judgment.

        "body": "One of the most hyped market-moving events of the year has arrived. Americans have headed to the polls Tuesday to vote in a presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The outcome could have an impact on financial markets for the rest of the year and beyond. For the broader market, Wall Street strategists say the biggest risk would be a contested election in which the result isn't clear for weeks. \"A close, contested election is the main tail risk we see for US equities in the days and months ahead, though we also suspect that a Democratic sweep could also catch US equity investors off guard,\" RBC Capital Markets Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday morning. To Calvasina's point, market strategists have been discussing the potential unwinding of a so-called Trump trade should the former president not win on Tuesday night. In the past month, as betting market odds moved in favor of Trump, certain sectors have rallied in the belief that the former president would boost those businesses' prospects if elected. For example: financials and cryptocurrencies. On Friday, when a fresh poll showed Kamala Harris leading Trump in Iowa, some of those trades began to reverse. Bitcoin had hit a recent high of $71,000 per coin before sliding briefly below 67,000 after the poll was released. Similarly, the Financials sector (XLF) was the second-worst-performing sector on Monday, that's after leading the 11 sectors in October potentially on the belief that Trump's policies would be more favorable for banks. Conversely, strategists have pointed to other trades that have lagged over the past month and could outperform if Harris wins. In a note to clients on Sunday night, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote that consumer goods companies, which Trump's tariff policy could hurt, have been pricing in potential negative impacts leading into the election. \"We see tariff-exposed consumer equities and renewables outperforming in the short term,\" Wilson wrote regarding a Harris win scenario where Congress ends up in a Red-Blue split. \"Financials, Industrials and commodity-sensitive industries could underperform initially.\" Wilson added that a split Congress could limit how long-lasting any of the moves are. \"In our view, market leadership in the divided Congress outcomes will likely come down to the business cycle, the Fed's reaction function, and industry-specific fundamentals following the election,\" Wilson wrote. There has been plenty of debate over what's been driving equity markets for the past month as investors have digested positive third quarter earnings, the start of the Federal Reserve's easing cycle, and a string of data releases showing the US economy is still growing solidly.

The company will aim for “digestible” and “strategically relevant acquisitions,” he said, without providing details of any potential targets. Saudi Arabia has seen numerous companies coming to its Tadawul stock exchange in recent years. As part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 plan, the country is seeking to build out its markets and diversify the economy away from oil. So far this year, $15.6 billion has been raised through stock sales on the bourse, including a mammoth offering from oil major Saudi Aramco, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Hodgkinson didn’t rule out bolting on other stock exchanges in the future, but said the group’s current focus is on diversifying its revenue mix. Earlier this year, Tadawul acquired a stake in the owner of the Dubai Mercantile Exchange for $28.5 million in a bid to grow into the commodities space. According to Hodgkinson, the group is looking into introducing a number of post-trade services around stock lending and collateral management, and is also exploring data services such as indices. When considering acquisition targets, the group will “exercise a great deal of discipline” on valuation and potential synergies, Hodgkinson said. M&A is intended to support the group’s organic growth strategy, he added.

Expectations are set for 75 cents in earnings per share (EPS) and revenue of $6.45 billion, according to Benzinga Pro data.

SMCI stock has taken a beating over the past year, with shares down 3.05% year-over-year and 8.83% year-to-date. The recent departure of Ernst & Young as its auditor over transparency and governance concerns hit shares even harder. While management has set up a special committee to address the issues, SMCI now faces a Nov. 20 deadline to regain Nasdaq compliance or risk delisting. The pressure is on for Super Micro to convince investors that it’s addressing these issues head-on.

From a technical perspective, SMCI is deep in bear territory. Chart created using Benzinga Pro The stock currently trades at $26.34, far below its 200-day simple moving average of $71.97, and shows no signs of recovery. With a relative strength index (RSI) of 23.71, SMCI is in oversold territory, suggesting the stock could fall further unless fundamentals improve. Meanwhile, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator sits at a negative 4.69, reinforcing the negative outlook. Super Micro's issues extend beyond the stock chart. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has reportedly rerouted some orders to Asia-based suppliers Gigabyte and ASRock, signaling that Super Micro Computer's internal issues are affecting business relationships. As demand for AI infrastructure remains robust, competition is fierce, and SMCI risks missing out on critical revenue streams if it can't maintain partner confidence. With Super Micro Computer’s first quarter results around the corner, analysts are wary. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann suspended his rating, citing a lack of financial clarity, while Wedbush's Matt Bryson slashed his price target from $62 to $32.            ",

Valeda is said to offer a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement equating to more than five letters or one line on an eye chart over 24 months. This treatment is aimed at improving vision in dry AMD patients. LumiThera Regulatory Affairs vice-president Lori Holder said: “The de novo authorisation established Valeda as the first device for treatment of dry AMD patients with vision loss and creates a threshold for this novel class of PBM devices that must show similar clinical and nonclinical performance controls equivalent to the Valeda light delivery system.” The LIGHTSITE III trial of Valeda in the US had met its primary endpoint and was found to be safe and effective in improving and maintaining enhanced visual acuity. The data from this trial was submitted to the FDA as part of a technical package with special controls earlier this year. Valeda previously received a CE mark in the European Union (EU) and is available in selected Latin American countries. In January 2024, LumiThera commenced the EUROLIGHT study for individuals with AMD. The multicentre clinical registry study enrolled between 500 and 1,000 patients who have received photobiomodulation (PBM) treatment within the last three years. This study will initially involve up to 20 centres across Europe and may expand to other countries outside the EU where Valeda is approved. The data from the study will be used to support reimbursement in various countries and offer clinical information on the real-world use of Valeda. \"FDA authorises marketing of LumiThera’s dry AMD treatment device\" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.

For a small rare disease company with a potential treatment in the clinic, one of the most prominent challenges isn’t necessarily the science — often, it’s having enough resources to reach the finish line. At Rallybio, a biotech with an early-stage candidate for the rare fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, a disease that arises from an incompatibility between blood platelets in expectant mothers and their unborn child, financing has been a difficult part of the puzzle. “The only currency a biotech company has is the story they tell,” said Dr. Steve Uden, CEO and co-founder of Rallybio. “We don’t have profit and loss — it’s all around being able to explain what you’re trying to do and the impact you’re trying to have.” Rallybio’s journey has been rife with tough decisions recently, from switching out its lead treatment candidate last year to cutting almost half its workforce earlier this year to extend its cash runway into mid-2026. But Uden and fellow co-founder Martin Mackay, who serves as Rallybio’s executive chairman, are devoted to bringing a rare disease treatment to patients despite a challenging investment climate. And the leaders, both of whom have served at the rare disease company Alexion, now owned by AstraZeneca, believe a small company approach is the way to get there. Even though funding isn’t at the same levels as a few years ago, the pair believe rare disease is an area where need will overcome financial hesitancy — as long as companies can withstand the meager times. “So long as scientists are driving for solutions, the money will come, and sometimes we have to ride a storm or two,” Mackay said. The disease that Rallybio’s lead candidate addresses has a decades-old predecessor that is still considered one of the most successful medical interventions of the 20th century. In fact, many people haven’t even heard of Rh disease — a red blood cell incompatibility between mother and child — which once killed about 10,000 newborns a year in the U.S., because the vaccine RhoGAM developed in the 1960s has been so effective at preventing it. Rallybio wants to do the same for the platelet version of the disease, abbreviated as FNAIT, which is rare but can also be fatal and has no approved therapy. The company, which got its start in 2018, is approved to begin a mid-stage trial after prioritizing the monoclonal antibody last year. Also in the company’s pipeline is an early-stage antibody-based inhibitor for complement dysregulation, which includes diseases like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, refractory generalized myasthenia gravis, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.

        "body": "By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks closed sharply higher in a broad rally on Tuesday after data signaled a solid economy, but investors braced for volatile trading this week as voting was underway in an extremely tight U.S. presidential election. The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers index, a gauge of the services sector, accelerated to 56.0 last month, its highest since August 2022, from 54.9 the prior month and above the 53.8 expected by economists polled by Reuters. The election outcome could take days to be finalized as the latest polls showed the race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, which has impacted markets in recent months, was too close to call. The former president's odds improved on Tuesday in betting markets that many investors see as election indicators. \"The market continues to try and price for what is the outcome of this election,\" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. \"It's been so tight and ...we've been in a tight price range, and so what's really moving us is marginal positioning for one result or the other.\" \"Both the bond market and the equity market are looking at Congress as important as well,\" he added. \"Most base cases are for divided government, but this election is so close we could get any outcome. That's the challenge.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 427.28 points, or 1.02%, to 42,221.88, the S&P 500 gained 70.07 points, or 1.23%, to 5,782.76 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 259.19 points, or 1.43%, to 18,439.17. Volatility was more pronounced in government debt and currency markets. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield rose more than 10 basis points to a high of 4.366% before paring gains on a solid auction, and was last down 2 basis points on the day. Equity markets avoided Monday's volatility on expectations of a soft landing for the economy, bolstered by corporate earnings, lower interest rates and a resilient labor market. Other economic data on Tuesday showed the trade deficit hit a 2-1/2 year high in September, as domestic demand draws in imports while concerns about higher tariffs under a Trump presidency have led to a front loading of imports by businesses. Still, the CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street's \"Fear Gauge,\" closed at 20.49, above its long-term average of 19.46, although it had eased from a near-two month high hit last week of 23.42.

        "body": "Updated at 11:09 AM EDT Palantir Technologies shares powered to a fresh all-time high in early Tuesday trading following a blowout earnings report that triggered a host of price target changes from analysts on Wall Street. Palantir  (PLTR) , which was added to the S&P 500 last month, has established itself as key player in the defense industry, with a host of contracts with domestic and international agencies that focus on its data-analytics and AI technologies. It's also seeing rapid growth in its commercial division, which includes the testing and reworking of artificial-intelligence systems through its AIP Logic platform, as well as \"boot camps\" for companies that are scaling the new technology across its business processes. The Denver group, founded by the tech investors Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, boosted its full-year revenue forecast for the third time this year, thanks in part to outsized gains from its nonmilitary business. The group's U.S. business saw revenue rise 44% over the three months ended in October to $499 million. Most of that, around $320 million, was from the government side, while commercial revenue grew at a faster rate, 54%, to $179 million. Palantir/TheStreet Palantir said it sees 2024 revenues in the region of $2.805 billion to $2.809 billion, an 8% improvement from its prior forecast, with operating income of around $1.055 billion. \"Given how strong our results are, I almost feel like we should just go home,\" CEO Alex Karp told investors on a conference call late Monday. “We absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won’t slow down,\" he said in a statement. \"This is a U.S.-driven AI revolution that has taken full hold. The world will be divided between AI haves and have-nots. At Palantir, we plan to power the winners.\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria, who boosted his price target on the group by $19 to $47 per share following last night's earnings report, cited \"unrelenting demand\" from its U.S. operations. Related: Why Palantir stock is a 'generational' play \"Palantir remains well positioned to benefit from surging enterprise interest in AI applications,\" he said. \"AIP and boot camps continue to be highlighted as a key reason for growth with new and existing customers today as Palantir is able to establish production use cases with customers faster than before.\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called the group's quarterly earnings \"eye-popping\" and noted that its AIP Logic platform \"continues to drive pipeline growth\".

The regulators charged in June that the iPhone maker had breached the bloc's tech rules. The charge against Apple was the first by the Commission under its Digital Markets Act (DMA). The fine is likely to come this month although the timing could still change, the sources said. The fine would add to Apple's mounting antitrust troubles, as EU regulators attempt to level the playing field for smaller firms. This comes just months after Brussels fined Apple 1.84 billion euros ($2.01 billion) in March for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store - Apple's first ever penalty for breaching EU rules. Apple also faces an investigation into new fees imposed on app developers. DMA violations could result in a fine of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover. The Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into force earlier this year, requires Apple to allow users to set the default web browser of their choice on iPads, permit alternative app stores on its operating system and allow headphones and smart pens to access iPad OS features. Apple declined to comment. The European Commission did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Apple also lost a long-running court battle with the EU in September, resulting in the company being forced to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland. Bloomberg first reported on Apple's imminent EU fine earlier on Tuesday. Watchdogs are readying the penalty after Apple failed to allow app developers to steer users to cheaper deals and offers outside of the App Store, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the case.

        "body": "Developing a strong investing portfolio is the key to building wealth, and a big part of that process is buying stocks. These types of securities represent a slice of ownership in a company, and allow individuals across the world to take advantage of the growth of a wide variety of businesses, from popular brands like Coca-Cola and Apple to little-known companies on the brink of a boom. When seeing the S&P 500 — an index that includes the stocks of many of the largest companies in the U.S. — experiencing historical average annual returns of around 10%, you can see how investing for the long term can help you retire comfortably, buy a house, pay for school and more. Financial experts talk a great deal about investing strategies like diversification and rebalancing. But before you integrate those into your investing strategy, you may be wondering: How many stocks should I own? Read on for how to get exposure to many stocks at once, how many stocks should make up a portfolio of individual stocks and more. Choosing individual stocks can be exciting, but the less risky move that tends to offer higher returns over the long term is investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. These baskets of securities can include hundreds, or even thousands, of stocks. While some called total market funds give exposure to the entire stock market, others invest specifically in funds of certain sizes and sectors, like technology. “They’re very resilient strategies that over the long term tend to do well with minimal effort,” says Nick Fazio, associate wealth advisor at Regent Peak Wealth Advisors. Some of the best index funds include the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (VTWO), which consists of about 2,000 small publicly traded companies in the U.S., and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which essentially covers the entire universe of publicly traded stocks in the country. A perk of funds is that no matter how many you invest in, you already have built-in diversification. The same can’t be said about stocks. For those who do want to buy individual funds, it’s important to not place all your eggs in one basket. If you buy two or three stocks, there’s a good chance they could tank at the same time. There have been several studies that attempt to nail down the amount of stocks to own in order to get the benefits of diversification. In 1968, academics John Evans and Stephen Archer determined said holding just 15 stocks gave you no more risk than investing in the whole market. Just a few years later, two more academics said you needed closer to 30 to get the benefits of diversification and limit risks. Other experts have said the number is between 12 and 18.           ",

        "body": "U.S. voters went to the polls Tuesday in what’s expected to be one of the tightest presidential elections in recent memory. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and former former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, have staked out vastly different positions on economic issues, including taxes, trade, and regulations, all of which could have implications for the stock market and your investments. Trump’s tariffs, if implemented as aggressively as he’s promised, would likely hit the bottom lines of importing companies, which is most U.S. firms, according to LPL Financial analysts Jeffrey Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist. Higher tariffs would also likely hurt sales for companies with substantial business outside the U.S., especially in China if it were to retaliate. “This risk is broad,” Buchbinder and Turnquist wrote in a presentation Monday, “as both industrial and consumer goods companies could be affected.” Harris has endorsed the targeted use of tariffs on certain Chinese goods to support U.S. manufacturing of green technology, an approach that would have a more muted effect on U.S. and international stocks. Each candidate’s tax policies could also affect the market in the longer term. Many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, one key piece of legislation from Trump’s presidential term, are set to expire in 2025. Trump has vowed to extend the sunsetting provisions and to enact additional cuts for domestic production that could lower companies’ effective tax rate to less than the current 21%. “Lower tax rates could help boost small caps and domestic-oriented industries like healthcare services, real estate, and utilities,” Buchbinder and Turnquist wrote. Harris has supported higher taxes for the wealthy and businesses. Buchbinder and Turnquist estimate that corporate profits would “take a small hit, probably no more than a few percentage points,” if the tax rate were raised to 25% from 21%. “Higher tax rates (and lower tariffs) could help multi-national, low-tax corporations that make up the industrials and technology sectors,” they said. The likelihood of Democrats increasing subsidies for low-income Americans could also support businesses in the consumer staples sector. Tax policy requires the approval of Congress, so each candidate’s plans would be dependent on support from Congress, where majorities are expected to be narrow. Trump has vowed to curtail regulations in a second term. He has said he would increase presidential control over some regulatory agencies and roll back Biden administration policies. Banks and energy companies are expected to be the greatest beneficiaries of Trump’s regulatory agenda.      ",

        "body": "While Wall Street reacted positively to Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Q3 results, I believe shares remain undervalued, presenting a compelling opportunity today. Alphabet’s core business segments, like Google Search and YouTube, remained robust and displayed impressive growth in Q3. However, the true highlight of the report was Google Cloud, which not only recorded a notable acceleration in revenue growth but also saw substantial operating income gains. Yet, Alphabet’s valuation doesn’t seem to fully reflect its ongoing momentum. For this reason, I remain invested in Alphabet, confident about the potential for upside in the stock. Alphabet’s core revenue segments, Google Search and YouTube, once again posted solid numbers in Q3, reinforcing the company’s position as a digital advertising and search leader. Although I hear concerns from investors and analysts about Alphabet’s lagging position in the large language model (LLM) search arena, the company continues to attract increasing advertising revenue. Specifically, Google Search saw a 12% revenue increase year-over-year, with management citing growing user engagement fueled by recent AI tools like AI Overviews and Circle to Search. AI Overviews has now been rolled out to over a billion users worldwide, enabling more complex queries and expanding how people interact with Search. Circle to Search, another AI feature that lets users draw a circle around an object in an image to search for similar items directly, is now active on over 150 million Android devices. The Circle to Search feature has been quite popular. Management reported that one-third of those who have tried it are now using it weekly, which translates to a strong indicator of its value. Meanwhile, YouTube recorded a 12% growth in ad revenue, driven by brand and direct-response ads. The platform’s progress in creating a more TV-like experience, including features like multiview, has definitely boosted its appeal, particularly in the living room space. Shorts is also doing really well, with monetization getting stronger again this quarter. It’s interesting to see how quickly it’s catching up to the in-stream video, especially in the U.S. and other high-ad revenue markets. Notably, 70% of channels uploading to YouTube each month post Shorts, helping Alphabet pull in even more ad dollars. Beyond Alphabet’s core segments performing well, the real standout in Q3 was Google Cloud, a major driver of my bullish outlook on the stock. The segment saw its revenue surge by 35% year-over-year, accelerating from the prior quarter’s 29% growth and well above last year’s 22%. This acceleration is powered by Alphabet’s ever-growing AI infrastructure, including the Gemini models, which power solutions in multimodal AI and real-time analytics.        ",

As per the agreement, NLS will issue common stock to Kadimastem's shareholders, with an estimated post-transaction share split of 80% for Kadimastem stakeholders and 20% for NLS stakeholders, contingent on cash and debt for both companies at closing. The deal is expected to close in January 2025. Following the announcement, stock prices for both companies surged. Kadimastem’s stock was up by over 22% in trading today (5 November) at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, NLS’s stock closed at $4.39 on Nasdaq yesterday, up by 21.9% compared to the market close on the previous working day (1 November). NLS plans to divest some of its legacy assets, including extended-release formulations of mazindol, which is marked as Quilience and Nolazol for treating narcolepsy. The company plans to distribute the net proceeds from these sales to its shareholders and warrant holders as outlined in a contingent value agreement. The merged company plans to focus on NLS’s Dual Orexin Agonist (DOA) platform and Kadimastem's allogeneic cell therapy program. The combined entity plans to start a Phase IIa US-based trial evaluating Kadimastem’s cell therapy AstroRx as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), following the deal close. AstroRx is an allogeneic cell therapy derived from embryonic astrocytes, a type of glial cell that makes up the central nervous system. In February 2023, Kadimastem reported positive data from an open-label Phase I/IIa trial (NCT03482050) of AstroRx in 10 ALS patients. Clinical benefit was seen three months post administration of AstroRx. The two doses of the therapy were well tolerated, with the company reporting no treatment-emergent adverse events. The companies also intend to file for a pre-investigational new drug application (IND) with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) meeting for Kadimastem’s islet cell therapy, IsletRx, as a treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes. The planned merger was first announced in July, however, the companies initially planned for Kadimastem to become a wholly owned subsidiary of NLS.  Kadimastem's executive chairman & president, Ronen Twito, voiced their enthusiasm for the merger deal noting “[we] believe that the exposure of the combined company's assets to the US capital markets through our new Nasdaq listing will enable us to develop our portfolio and increase Kadimastem shareholder value.”      ",

Arm, a semiconductor and software design company, has given Qualcomm a mandated 60-day notice of the cancellation of their architectural license agreement, which allows Qualcomm to create its own chips based on standards owned by Arm. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸 The move ratchets up a legal fight that began in 2022, when Arm sued Qualcomm — one of its biggest customers — for breach of contract and trademark infringement. The two companies are headed to a trial to resolve the breach-of-contract claim by Arm and a countersuit by Qualcomm. The disagreement centers on Qualcomm’s 2021 acquisition of another Arm licensee and a failure — according to Arm — to renegotiate contract terms. Qualcomm argued that its existing agreement covers the activities of the company that it purchased, the chip-design startup Nuvia. Both Qualcomm and Arm are scheduled to report quarterly results on Nov. 6. TheStreet Pro's Chris Versace said that even if the two companies ultimately go to trial, the possibility of a deal remains, \"which means we will have to monitor developments closely.\" \"That means parsing their September-quarter earnings call comments, even though they are likely to be minimal,\" the veteran trader wrote on Oct. 23.

The Dow is a widely followed index made up of the 30 biggest companies with a history dating back to the 1800’s. NVDA and SHW will be replacing Intel (INTC) and Dow Inc. (DOW) – no relation to the index. This week, I examine past changes to the Dow’s constituents and explore how the stocks tended to perform after being added or removed. I have a list of 26 stocks that have joined the Dow Industrials since 1997. I looked at how those stocks performed after officially being added to the index. The table below summarizes the returns. The second table is for comparison, and it shows what the returns looked like had you purchased the index instead of the individual stocks. The results are mixed. The stocks averaged an 8% return over the first three months after being added to the index with 65% of the returns being positive. However, a year after the additions, those same stocks were up just 1.74% on average, with less than half of the returns positive. Based on this, avoid NVDA and SHW and put that money in a Dow index fund. Purchasing the Dow Index rather than the stocks would have yielded a 7.45% return on average with 84% of returns positive over the next year. The last change to the Dow was earlier in February, when Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). Since then, AMZN has gained over 12%, while WBA is down more than 50%. The table below shows the stocks added to the Dow since 2010. These stocks have fared better than the summarized table above but still, less than half have outperformed the index over the next six months and year. My list of stocks removed from the Dow is less than stocks added, because more of these companies have gone out of business or have been bought out. So perhaps we’re not getting the full picture. The 18 stocks I have data for have performed terribly, especially immediately after leaving the index. These stocks have averaged over an 8% loss over the next month of trading after leaving the index with only 17% being positive or beating the Dow Index. The six-month returns also underperform by a lot averaging a loss of 2.7% with 33% positive. Nine of the 18 stocks, however, have beaten The Dow over the next six months. Here’s the list of individual stocks removed from the index since 2010. These ten stocks show significant underperformance in the first month of trading, averaging a loss of 3.8% with just 30% positive and 30% beating the Dow Index. Over the longer term, the stocks eliminated from the index have done much better than stocks added. Over the next year, these stocks averaged an impressive 28% return with 67% of them beating the index. The stocks added to The Dow since 2010 have averaged a return of 6.3% with just 44% beating the Dow Index (see table above).  ",

Most components of the so-called Trump trade continued to weaken after retreating on Monday. The greenback fell again on Tuesday, with the U.S. Dollar Index down 0.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield eased 2 basis points to 4.29%, but Bitcoin rose 3%.

Overseas markets eyed the U.S. election's final hours cautiously as the next president could have a major impact on the global economy, particularly on trade. Trump has vowed to hike tariffs across the board, with duties on China especially poised to soar. And on Monday, he threatened to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico unless it closed its border with the U.S.—and boost it as high as 100% if it didn't comply. In China, the CSI 300 Index rallied 2.5%, and Shanghai’s SSE Composite Index gained 2.3%. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 added 1.1%, and the Topix rose 0.8%.

But if vote tallies are disputed or delayed for an extended period, that could leave markets in limbo. Other races are critical too, as the party that controls Congress will also determine how much leeway the next president has to enact policies. Separately, the Fed wraps up its policy meeting on Thursday, with rates expected to come down 25 basis points. Under another Trump administration, investors expect less regulation from the federal government. That should boost bank stocks, cryptocurrencies and crypto stocks like Coinbase, as well as companies in the oil and gas sector. He has also threatened to roll back President Joe Biden's signature policies, including those that encourage renewable energy and electric vehicles. Trump's promise to curb immigration and launch a mass deportation campaign has also lifted shares of prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic.          ",

All states have now closed their respective polling stations. So far, Trump has secured 248 electoral college votes, while Harris has claimed 214, according to the Associated Press. The stock had a wild session during market hours on Tuesday as trading was halted several times due to volatility, with shares quickly erasing 15% gains and reversing Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. Despite a recovery from steeper losses, shares still closed down a little over 1%. The latest price action comes as investors await the results of the presidential election between the Republican nominee and his challenger. Volatility in the stock is expected to continue as strategists categorize the stock as a binary bet on the election.

In September, shares in the company — the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform, Truth Social — traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had bounced back from their lows, though, as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period.       ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas are among market watchers who said this week that the stock benchmark is poised to swing higher once a victor is declared. Meanwhile, Jefferies LLC strategists say equities weakness in the week before the vote has typically been a good omen for performance in the subsequent month, making last week’s slump a potentially bullish signal. Of course, it’s anyone’s guess how long it will take to get a clear result after the vote ends Tuesday, for both the presidency and the makeup of Congress. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been running neck-and-neck in the polls, which has helped curb risk appetite over the past few weeks. The US equities benchmark has held below last month’s record high, which it reached on momentum spurred by Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, a resilient economy and the artificial-intelligence boom. While US equities are coming off their first monthly loss since April, the drop of less than 3% was more benign than the historical pattern of 4%-5% selloffs on average in October going into close presidential races, according to Deutsche Bank AG. Meanwhile, inflows to US stocks this year have been robust — roughly $500 billion — a sharp contrast from prior years when they kicked in only after the election, per data from the bank. The call for a year-end rally has history on its side, as it tends to be a seasonally strong period for US stocks. To Morgan Stanley’s Wilson, the election could serve as a “clearing event” that kicks off a year-end rush into stocks. He sees scope for the S&P 500 to reach 6,100 in that period, a roughly 5.5% gain from Tuesday’s close of 5,782.76. At JPMorgan, Lakos-Bujas says the setup for equities looks solid through December once the presidential race is called. He expects confidence to grow and volatility to decrease, leading investors to unwind hedges and refocus on the Fed at a time when the economy and corporate earnings remain resilient, a combination that will drive further gains. To be sure, the outlook for stocks also depends on what happens with Congress. Lakos-Bujas, for example, says that in a scenario where Washington is mired in political gridlock, stocks will do well regardless of who wins the presidency.            ",

Shares in the company fell 2% in early Frankfurt trade. Quarterly currency-adjusted sales rose to 2.31 billion euros ($2.48 billion), broadly stable from a year earlier but short of the 2.36 billion euros expected by analysts, according to LSEG data. Puma's results were driven by selling more soccer and running shoes in the quarter, with footwear sales up 9.3%. Demand for the recently relaunched Formula 1-inspired 'Speedcat' shoe was strong, CEO Arne Freundt said in a statement. However, sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), its biggest market, rose only by 0.8% in the period. The company confirmed its full-year outlook for currency adjusted revenue in mid single-digit percentage, and core profit (EBIT) of between 620 million to 670 million euros, citing a strong order book for the remainder of the year.

Wilson says the market will face a pullback amid fiscal consolidation next year. He adds that the market needs a catalyst beyond the Magnificent Seven for future gains. The market is ripe for gains going into the end of the year, but the rally could be short-lived, Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson says. Wilson says the S&P 500 could surge as much as 5% this year as election-related uncertainty fades and markets rally through the rest of 2024. \"I think we could see 6,000, potentially, in some sort of a clearing event where there's not a lot of consternation and people feel good about things,\" Wilson said in a Monday interview with Bloomberg, adding, \"We're into the FOMO season, and people need to perform in the next two months.\" He added that he could see upwards of 6,100, implying almost 5% upside from the benchmark's closing level of 5,782 on Tuesday. He says the index likely can't climb higher than that, though, since valuations are currently almost 22 times earnings, and since growth is unlikely to pick up for multiples to expand further into the next year. \"I think it's really hard for us to get past 6,100 in any scenario, because then you're just so stretched on valuation. And I don't see growth accelerating in a kind of way that would justify even higher multiples for 2025,\" he said. Looking ahead to 2025, there will need to be some level of fiscal consolidation no matter which candidate wins the election, he says. That will bring more uncertainty, and could send the market on a rollercoaster ride, he says. \"I could see a blowoff move of some kind, post-election, a clearing event, but then reality sets in that we're going to have to have some kind of fiscal consolidation next year no matter who wins, and in my view I think it has to happen. And that's gonna create uncertainty again, and positioning kinda gets whipped around,\" he said. Wilson added the market needs a new theme beyond the Magnificent Seven and high-growth tech to get excited about and act as a catalyst for further growth. Mega-cap tech earnings were mixed in the latest earnings season, with concerns growing about high spending on artificial intelligence. \"We need something to get excited about. We're kinda lacking it. But something will happen. In other words, the market will find a new shiny toy, and it will move to that shiny toy,\" he said.   ",

Adjusted EPS of $1.40 beat the analyst consensus of $1.29. The company expects fiscal 2024 revenue of $10.14 billion – $10.17 billion (prior $10.12 billion – $10.17 billion) and adjusted EPS of $5.15 – $5.20 (prior $5.03 – $5.11). Also Read: Short Squeeze – GlobalFoundries Stock Soars On Q3 Earnings Beat, Strong Q4 Outlook Multiple analysts rerated the stock after the print. RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin maintained Fidelity National Info with an Outperform and raised the price target from $95 to $104. KeyBanc analyst Alex Markgraff remained Sector Weight on Fidelity National Info. Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance reiterated a Buy on Fidelity National Info with a price target of $100, up from $97. RBC Capital: Perlin highlighted FIS’ recent performance, noting strength in core banking sales and operating leverage in capital markets. Banking segment adjusted revenue grew by 3% year-over-year to $1.71 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.2%, supported by cost-saving efforts and an increasing proportion of recurring revenue, up 6% year-over-year. The recent acquisition of Dragonfly, which offers liquidity management and fraud prevention for complex commercial clients, enhances FIS’ digital offerings and opens cross-selling opportunities with banks not yet using FIS’ core services. The Capital Markets segment posted 7% adjusted revenue growth, reaching $730 million, with a 49.9% EBITDA margin. This was attributed to a favorable revenue mix and operational leverage. Management anticipates ongoing margin expansion in the segment, driven by increased recurring revenue and a boost in cross-selling activity across the enterprise, which rose 20% year-to-date. KeyBanc: Markgraff observed that FIS reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its full-year guidance. However, the increase was primarily due to reduced interest expenses and added Worldpay EMI contributions rather than core operational growth. Adjusted revenue in Banking grew 3% year-over-year, driven by steady recurring revenue. Capital Markets adjusted revenue also rose by 7%, reflecting substantial operating leverage and an advantageous revenue mix. Despite an upbeat revenue beat, Markgraff noted that higher capital expenditures—partly from vendor pricing pressures—dampened immediate market response to the results. The outlook suggests strong momentum, particularly in Capital Markets, though Banking growth is expected to settle closer to the lower to midpoint of its projected range.

Many of the world’s top investors, including the legendary Warren Buffett, have used the value approach to generate outstanding returns over time. In recent years, however, value stocks have drastically trailed growth stocks as low interest rates propelled the valuations of fast-growing companies. From 2011 to 2020, large value funds underperformed large growth funds by more than 5 percentage points each year, according to Morningstar. In 2020, the gap was an astounding 32.2 percent. Value outperformed in 2022, with the Russell 1000 Value index falling about 7.5 percent compared to a more than 29 percent decline for the Russell 1000 Growth index.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers Investors see the Japanese currency as likely to weaken further as Trump emerges as the victor, because his economic policy is seen as more expansionary and inflationary than that of Harris, making it less likely for the Federal Reserve to aggressively cut interest rates. Japan’s markets are in particular focus, given their size and liquidity, and the heavy focus on the dollar-yen currency pair during Asian trading hours. The yen weakened 1.6% to 153.98 per dollar at 4:15 p.m. in Tokyo. Japanese share prices rose, with the tech-heavy Nikkei 225 climbing 2.6% while the broader Topix index gained 1.9%. Bank shares rose 5.8% to become the top gaining sector on the prospects of higher interest rates and hopes of deregulations, while defense-related companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. jumped on speculation Trump will put pressure on Japan to spend more on its own defense. “Dollar-yen can gain further ground if the results continue to point to a Trump victory and equity markets continue to focus on his pro-growth policies,” said Carol Kong, a strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “I’d just caution dollar-yen can unwind all the gains if equity markets turn their focus to the prospect of another trade war between the US and China.” BOJ Implications The yen’s persistent slide in recent years has been fueling imported inflation, putting pressure on the central bank to raise borrowing costs and adding to the woes of Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party, which needs to forge a new coalition after losing a majority in the Lower House in an election last month. “Given the fall in the yen, I think a BOJ rate hike in December is possible now,” said Yasuhiko Hirakawa, head of investment at Rakuten Investment Management Inc. Japan’s 10-year government bond futures dropped 49 ticks to 143.78. The 10-year benchmark cash debt yield rose 4.5 basis points to 0.980% while the two-year note yield rose to a 16-year high. Japanese shares have failed to climb back to record levels hit in July as the yen’s recovery from its nadir that month and rising borrowing costs weighed on sentiment. A 12% plunge in both the Topix and Nikkei indexes on Aug. 5 was a reminder that Japan’s recently high-flying stocks have a lot of room to fall if investor sentiment turns pessimistic.              ",

Beijing is monitoring the US presidential election and may adjust its fiscal stimulus based on its outcome. China is playing up its economy as the US heads to the polls in a closely watched presidential election. On Tuesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang touted his country's economy, saying he's confident of hitting its GDP growth target of around 5% this year, according to state media. He also drummed up market expectations for more economic stimulus, saying Beijing has \"ample space for fiscal policy and monetary policy.\" Li's remarks came just as the Purchasing Managers' Index survey from Caixin and S&P Global showed October services activity in China expanded at its fastest pace in three months. Business confidence also rose to the highest level since May, the private-sector survey showed. Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said China's aggressive stimulus in late September has improved sentiment. \"The Caixin manufacturing and services PMI surveys showed that market demand stabilized and optimism improved, early signs of the new policies' impact,\" Wang said. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note that Li's comments highlight China's \"significant policy flexibility.\" China's services PMI survey results on Tuesday also boosted risk sentiment in the world's second-largest economy, they added. China's benchmark CSI 300 Index closed 2.5% higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed 2.1% higher. Amid Li's show of confidence, Beijing is watching the US presidential election closely to determine its next course of action. China's Standing Committee of National People's Congress — its top legislative body — is meeting through Friday and is expected to announce fresh fiscal stimulus to prop up its economy, which has been mired in a prolonged economic downturn amid an epic property crisis. \"Whispers are that Beijing may have to augment the size and details of the fiscal stimulus depending on whether it is a Harris or Trump Presidency,\" Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho Bank's chief economist of Asia excluding Japan, wrote in a note on Friday. China's legislative body would be considering a plan to raise $1.4 trillion in extra debt over the next few years to fund a part of an economic rescue package, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter.

The company said it \"remains unable at this time to predict when the Form 10-K will be filed.\" Super Micro said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.65 in its fiscal second quarter, below consensus estimates of $0.80, per Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, Super Micro's forecast for net sales in a range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion was weaker than the $6.79 billion on Wall Street had expected. \"Certainly it looks like revenues aren't where they wanted them to be either for the quarter they just reported or moving forward at the same time,\" Wedbush Securities equity research analyst Matt Bryson told Yahoo Finance. Bryson added that uncertainty on who Super Micro will hire as its next auditor or when it will be able to file its 10-K annual filing remain a headwind for the stock. \"There's a whole lot of unknown here,\" Bryson said. The earnings came less than a week after accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) resigned as Super Micro's auditor. EY said in a filing it was \"unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management.\" Super Micro responded to those accusations on Tuesday with a response from an independent special committee that had been investigating the accusations. \"Following a three-month investigation led by Independent Counsel, the Committee’s investigation to date has found that the Audit Committee has acted independently and that there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors,\" the release said. \"The Committee is recommending a series of remedial measures for the Company to strengthen its internal governance and oversight functions, and the Committee expects to deliver the full report on the completed work this week or next.\" EY's resignation came two months after a short report from Hindenburg Research alleged, among other things, \"accounting manipulation\" at the artificial intelligence highflier. After the stock rallied earlier in the year as investors cheered SMCI's prospects in the AI data center space, shares are now down more than 60% over the past six months.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The cost of protection against corporate defaults in Europe and Asia fell the most since early September, with the iTraxx Europe index of high-grade names about 2.5 basis points tighter to 55.6 basis points. The insurance costs for European junk-rated companies also slumped, while an index of Asian high-grade dollar debt was as much as 3.3 basis points tighter earlier, based on CBBT pricing data. The positive reaction in the credit-default swaps market reflects “the market-friendly environment, but is likely to be mixed and to vary by sector,” wrote strategists including Michael Teig at UniCredit SpA after results from some key states were released. So-called Trump trades prevailed across asset classes, pushing up equities, Treasury yields and the dollar. The Republican is on the cusp of recapturing the White House, though several major battleground states remain to be called. Moves in the actual corporate bonds that the CDS protects are more mixed. Euro investment-grade notes are on average 0.6 basis points tighter on Wednesday, with subordinated financial bonds among the main winners and the energy sector widening. UniCredit’s Teig favors US banks, which account for a large share of euro-denominated credit indexes due to “US-economic-growth-friendly policies, fewer interest-rate cuts and potentially less strict banking regulation,” but sees carmakers being sensitive to protectionism. Furthermore, analysts expect a much bigger jump in the US budget deficit under the tax cuts proposed by Trump — likely meaning higher interest rates and borrowing costs for both households and businesses. “If the market does price higher rates due to higher deficits, that might cheapen dollar bonds on an outright basis, so that may also attract all-in yield buyers,” said Pauline Chrystal, a fund manager at Kapstream Capital in Sydney. Markets outside the US also need to consider the impact of possible tariffs. That’s particularly the case in Asia, after the former president threatened during the election campaign to impose extreme tariffs on Chinese goods. “With a Trump presidency looking increasingly likely, we suspect the resultant surge higher in Treasury yields and US stocks will squeeze dollar credit spreads even tighter,” said Mark Reade, head of credit strategy at Mizuho Securities Asia.

The company said after the bell Monday that outgoing CEO Rick Dreiling is stepping down immediately to deal with health issues. Dollar Tree also reiterated its guidance for the third quarter, and said its strategic review of a potential sale or spin-off of Family Dollar is progressing.  Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares jumped Tuesday morning on news that the discount retailer is beginning the search for a new CEO. The company's previous chairman and CEO, Rick Dreiling, stepped away from the roles as of November 3. He did so to spend time with family as his health has seen \"new challenges\" emerge over the last two months, Dreiling said in a company news release late Monday. Dollar Tree's chief operating officer (COO) Michael Creedon will become the interim CEO, according to a news release, as the company begins its search for a new permanent leader. Dollar Tree also reiterated its third-quarter outlook a month before it plans to report earnings. The retailer's first two quarters of earnings have each missed estimates in 2024. The company's executives have said Dollar Tree has faced \"immense pressures\" as consumers cut spending. Also on Monday, Dollar Tree said it's continuing to review a best path forward for the Family Dollar brand. In its first quarter results over the summer, the company said it was starting a review of options for Family Dollar about a decade after acquiring the discount retail rival, including a potential sale or spinning it off into its own company again. Dollar Tree shares were up about 3.3% to $69.00 in premarket trading Tuesday, but have still lost more than half their value this year. ",

Vice President Kamala Harris and previous President, Donald J. Trump, are vying to be the 47th president of the United States. When Americans go to the polls on Nov. 5, it could prove to be a very close race. But whichever candidate becomes the next commander-in-chief, they’re likely to inherit a stock market that’s in record territory, a relatively low interest-rate environment in historical terms, and a growing economy. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💸💰 Since the 2004 election, when President George W. Bush was elected for a second term, the stock market has made a spectacular run leading up to the end of President Joseph Biden’s term. In each of the past five presidential elections, the S&P 500 Index has risen in the first year following the November vote. There have been some big gains and small ones as well. In Bush’s second term, the S&P 500 gained 7.4% in the first year after the vote, compared to the 38% gain in the year after Biden was voted into office. The stock market has benefited from low interest rates in every presidential term since 2004, with President Barack Obama experiencing a historically long period of near-zero interest rates. The Federal funds rate, a benchmark of borrowing costs, was around 5% during Bush’s term, but it dropped to near zero at the end of his term and the tail end of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Rates stayed close to zero throughout Obama’s two terms and started to pick up during President Donald J. Trump’s term. The COVID-19 pandemic struck, and the Federal Reserve went through a round of quantitative easing to help prevent the economy from collapsing. But inflation started to accelerate during Biden’s presidency, and the Fed tightened monetary policy. Still, the Fed was late in loosening monetary policy. But the stock market welcomed lower interest rates in the second half of 2024, just as the election was taking place, and investors responded by sending major stock indexes to record highs. Here’s how the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, has fared after each of the past 5 elections, since 2004.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround The yield on 10-year gilts climbed as much as eight basis points to 4.53%, slightly surpassing last week’s peak to reach the highest in a year. Short-dated rates also rose, outpacing US and euro-area peers, and demand for new bonds in an auction was the weakest in almost a year. Bond investors are concerned that Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s plans to run up borrowing to boost investments will fuel inflation, limiting the Bank of England’s ability to cut interest rates. Gilts sold off sharply after the budget announcement and resumed losses on Tuesday amid broad market anxiety over the US election result. “It’s a combination of US election uncertainty and concern about the budget,” said Mark Nash, head of fixed income alternatives at Jupiter Asset Management. “There seems to be some fear in the market that the budget won’t work.” Earlier on the day, an auction of new 10-year gilts attracted the weakest demand since December, with bids totaling 2.81 times the £3.75 billion ($4.9 billion) on offer. That contrasts with solid investor interest for recent sales, including a 30-year green note offer last week. It’s all a sign that investors aren’t willing to accept any hint of government largess when it comes to deficit spending. Last week, Wall Street veteran Ed Yardeni warned that “it’s a conceivable scenario that the bond vigilantes are definitely mounting up,” also referring to risks of increased spending in the US. That’s a particularly sensitive topic in the UK, where the government is looking to sell the second-highest amount of bonds in the current fiscal year. The plans caused the yield on 10-year gilts to jump more than 20 basis points last week, reviving memories of former Prime Minister Liz Truss’ fiasco of a mini-budget two years ago. Giles Gale, a strategist at UBS Group AG, also points to the structural shift in the UK bond market caused by pension funds buying fewer long-dated gilts. They were major buyers that have yet to be replaced, he said. Election Risk The losses in UK bonds were compounded by uncertainty around the US presidential election result. Many investors are sitting on the sidelines ahead of the outcome, which remains too close to call.              ",

The figure also exceeds the combined total of accounts opened between May and September. The surge in new openings, mostly by individuals, shows a revival of animal spirits after a series of policy measures in late September sparked an epic rally in local shares. Investors attention now shifts to a key gathering of Chinese lawmakers this week, where a fiscal package is expected to be approved. The flurry of retail activity follows months of anemic trading in the onshore market. In August, just 1 million accounts were opened — the lowest since February 2015. Before the stimulus-induced surge, the benchmark CSI 300 Index had slid to a five-year low, weighed down by a deepening property slump, weak consumption, and geopolitical headwinds. Other indicators also suggest growing trading interest among China’s mom-and-pop investors. The outstanding value of margin debt on local stock exchanges has risen to a two-year high, despite A-shares trading below their early October peaks. Daily turnover topped 2 trillion yuan ($281 billion) in three of the past four sessions, triple the average from previous months.

The climate, delightfully mild is also helping deflate oil demand, prices and expectations.  While infrastructure trends are reducing the quantity of oil keeping us warm and healthy through Winter, the last two Winters delightfully mild has distillate oil (diesel and heating) inventory high on the U.S. East Coast (Figure 7, red line).  The area of the country where heating oil is still a major source.  This inventory rising toward 37.2 million barrels (mmb) as September began dropped the East Coast spot market price of distillate oil (Figure 8).  Although this inventory is down to 32.1 mmb last week, that is 7.3 more than last year (blue line).  Distillate inventory in the rest of the country, 5.7 mmb less than last year, has many set up to soon be caught oil short. Helped by the rest of the Northern Hemisphere also overdue for a cold Winter. East Coast distillate-oil inventory (and only East Coast) rising into September provided a big, buy-low opportunity.  What is happening with all oil and natural gas right now.  East Coast distillate oil inventory experiencing a significant year-over-year (YOY) increase into September (Figure 8) deflated the East Coast distillate oil price to $2.00 per gallon in August and then dropped it to $1.589 per gallon in September (Figure 8, red line).  While that is a big drop, it is $11.186 per mmBtu. Distillate oil a backup to natural gas and $13.45 per mmBtu the latest price for natural gas in the Netherlands is why we predict the U.S. price of natural gas rises to $7 per mmBtu and remains there quite a few years, to restore production growth that keeps up with significant, consensus-beating worldwide demand growth. The nature of natural gas prices not understood is another factor that has almost all set up to soon to be caught natural gas short.  The Henry Hub price of natural gas most dominant and it down below $2.00 per mmBtu (Figure  9, blue line) has those aware and thinking about it with low expectations.  Nevertheless, back last January when much was suddenly needed (Figures 5 and 6), the price jumped up to a $13.080 per mmBtu high.  High prices not uncommon is more evident in the daily, California Composite, average spot price (red line).  High demand and inventory low in January of 2023 jumped this price up toward $25 per mmBtu and average $11.994 during January and February.  It jumped to $17.34 with last January’s cold air (Figure 5).   High prices reflect suppliers committed but short of the sudden big demand jump, needing to get someone with supply to give it up.

While these gains have propelled many portfolios into the green, veteran investor Jim Rogers said he is deeply concerned. “Nearly every stock market in the world has had an all-time high, or near an all-time high,” he told Wealthion in a recent interview, warning that when everyone is making profits, “somebody better look out the window and get worried.” Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger.

Here's how Earlier this year, reports showed that 14 of the world’s 20 largest stock markets hit record highs. According to Rogers, “just about everybody in the world has joined in now.” Rogers’ caution is rooted in experience, as he said he understands what follows market euphoria. “I’ve been around long enough, or have read enough to know that when everybody is making a lot of money and piling in, it usually means things are going to go bad soon,” he admitted. Rogers has indeed navigated his share of turbulent times. He co-founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros in 1973, right in the middle of a devastating bear market. Between then and 1980, the portfolio returned 4,200%, while the S&P 500 rose only 47%. Rogers isn’t joining the global stock market euphoria. As he told Wealthion, “I have sold my shares in most countries in the world.” But he hasn’t sold everything. “I’m still long Uzbekistan, and I would hope I will buy more Uzbekistan. I still am long China,” he said. This aligns with Rogers’ long-standing belief in Asia’s growth potential. He underscored this sentiment, asserting, “Whether we like it or not, the 21st century is going to be the century of Asia.” Given Rogers’ cautious outlook on the markets, it’s no surprise he’s turning to safe-haven assets like gold and silver. “I know from history that the world is going to have problems again … and when the world has problems… it’s nice to have some gold in the closet, or under the bed, have some silver in the closet,” he said. “Because no matter what, many people will turn to gold and silver in times of turmoil.”               ",

Domestic LV sales, excluding exports, reached 2.3 million units, marking a year-on-year (YoY) decrease of 5.4% but a significant month-on-month (MoM) increase of 17.2%. The substantial YoY and MoM differences may be attributed to the high sales base in the previous year and the gradual impact of the old-for-new subsidy policy. Breaking down the figures by model type, Passenger Vehicle (PV) sales totalled 2.1 million units, with a 2.4% YoY decline but a substantial MoM increase of 18.0%. In contrast, Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs) also showed a downward trend, which was much more obvious than PV. Although LCV sales increased by 8.4% in September compared with August, they fell sharply, by 31.1%, compared with the same period last year. In the first nine months of 2024, cumulative LV sales reached 17.2 million units, a YoY decrease of 2.7%. Among that number, cumulative PV sales were 15.4 million units, a YoY decrease of 2.0%. LCV's cumulative sales were 1.8 million units, a YoY decrease of 8.4%. Despite the ongoing scrapping subsidy programme and significant price reductions, the Chinese market slowed for the second consecutive month. The September selling rate was 25.6 million units per year, an almost 4% decrease from August. The YTD selling rate averaged 24.4 million units per year, compared to last year's total LV sales of 25.2 million units. In YoY terms, sales fell by 6% in September and 2.8% YTD. New energy vehicles (NEVs), predominantly Chinese brands, continued to grow, accounting for 55% of PV sales in September, while sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles continued to decline sharply. Seasonally-adjusted annualized selling rate (SAAR) in China Although the September data fell short of expectations, the third-quarter average selling rate of 26.5 million units per year showed improvement over the second quarter's 25.4 million units per year and the first quarter's 21.3 million units per year. Based on the quarterly average, the PV selling rate accelerated in Q3, offsetting the significant slowdown in the LCV sector. It is also important to note that the YoY declines from June to September were influenced by the exceptionally strong sales levels of the previous year. We anticipate that YoY growth will turn positive in the fourth quarter, driven by a lower base and the temporary scrapping subsidy programme.          ",

By the time Chinese markets closed, Trump had claimed victory over Democrat Kamala Harris in the tight U.S. presidential race. US stock futures jumped and the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) rose across the board after Republicans won a clear U.S. Senate majority although it won't be clear for some time which party will win control of the House of Representatives. China's blue-chip CSI 300 (000300.SS) Index fell 0.5%, while Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng (^HSI), which is more indicative of foreign investor sentiment, fell 2.3%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index fell 2.6%. Hong Kong-listed China tech stocks declined broadly, with e-commerce giant JD.com (JD, 9618.HK) and Alibaba (BABA, 9988.HK) down 4% each. The U.S. presidential election will have a meaningful impact on China's economy and capital markets. As part of his pitch to boost American manufacturing, Trump had promised voters he will impose tariffs of 60% or more on goods from China. \"Right now, the markets are focusing narrowly on the prospect of tariffs because it is the easiest lever to pull directly under a presidential executive order, but we’ve seen between 2016-20 other levers that can be pulled to contain China,\" said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments. \"It can include financial sanctions on Chinese entities, further tightening the screws on Chinese access to technology critical to AI development...the list goes on.\" Thus foreign investors are likely to position themselves defensively on any China-related assets, and probably hedge their currency risk, he said. China's equity market is in the midst of recovering from a years-long slump as authorities promise to address weak consumption and a downturn in the real estate sector. The CSI 300 index is up more than 20% since Sept. 23, when Beijing started rolling out rate cuts and stimulus. But a Trump win could stymie that rally, with technology, defence and export sectors in the crosshairs of his policies. Since both Democrats and Republicans are relatively united in antagonism to China, markets may not react dramatically until concrete policy changes are announced. \"Although both candidates are probably hawkish toward China, Trump is still less predictable in terms of policy, so the prospect of a Trump win could still drag sentiment a bit,\" said Kenny Ng, strategist at China Everbright Securities International in Hong Kong.

But just eight months after shares hit a record high, investors are asking whether the server maker will be delisted by Nasdaq Inc. and booted from the S&P 500. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The troubled firm — which has seen shares plummet more than 75% since March — is due to give a business update on Tuesday after the close. Top of mind is what it says about meeting Nasdaq Inc.’s compliance obligations following the resignation of auditor Ernst & Young LLP last week. The auditor cited concerns about Super Micro’s commitment to integrity and ethics — a blow that follows a US Department of Justice probe and a damaging short-seller report earlier this year. The stock was up 1.2% midday in New York after reversing an earlier loss. Options data signal that traders see shares moving as much as 20% in either direction after the company’s business update. Super Micro’s listing status was already looking shaky after it failed to file its annual 10-K report by an August deadline. Nasdaq rules give the company until mid-November to submit a plan to restore it to compliance, and if that plan is approved, it could get extra time — pushing the deadline to February 2025. But the resignation of Ernst & Young makes that more challenging. “I think that they probably end up getting delisted just because of the timelines involved,” Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said in an interview. “How do they get their 10-K out in just a few months when they don’t have an auditor and their last auditor resigned?” Representatives for Super Micro, Nasdaq and S&P Global, which owns the S&P 500 Index, declined to comment. A Nasdaq delisting would be the latest development in a tumultuous year. Super Micro shares were flying high at the start of 2024, with Wall Street enthusiastic about AI-fueled demand for its high-powered data center servers, and the company winning inclusion in the S&P 500. But investors have been bailing as issues pile up, with the 10-K filing delay followed by news that regulators are looking into an ex-employee’s claims that the company sought to overstate its revenue. At the time of Ernst & Young’s resignation, Super Micro said it doesn’t expect the issue to lead to restatements of previously issued financial reports, and that it has begun the process of identifying another auditor.

Restaurant Brands reported adjusted earnings per share of 93 cents, missing the street view of 95 cents. Quarterly sales of $2.291 billion missed the analyst consensus estimate of $2.307 billion. The company reported consolidated comparable sales growth of 0.3% and a 3.8% increase in net restaurants compared to the previous year. System-wide sales saw a 3.2% year-over-year rise. Income from operations was $577 million, slightly down from $582 million in the prior year. However, adjusted operating income reached $652 million, reflecting a 6.1% organic growth when excluding foreign exchange impacts and Restaurant Holdings. “We have been pleased to see an improvement in consolidated comparable sales in October and remain confident we will achieve our 8% plus Adjusted Operating Income growth target for 2024 and beyond,” said Josh Kobza.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s rising presidential prospects rippled through global markets on Wednesday, with US stock futures rallying, Treasury yields jumping and the dollar surging the most since March 2020. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers S&P 500 futures climbed 1.8%, 10-year yields rose 14 basis points to a four-month high of 4.41% and Bitcoin spiked to a record – moves that reflect the Republic nominee being on the cusp of recapturing the White House. Trump claimed victory in an address to supporters as the latest results showed he won both Pennsylvania and Georgia, and Republicans gained control of the US Senate. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was up 1.4%. The Mexican peso slumped 2.6%, while the Japanese yen and the euro slid at least 1.6%. Contracts on the Russell 2000 Index added 4.6%. Smaller companies with typically domestic operations are seen as potential gainers in a Republican win, given the party’s protectionist stance. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. surged in trading on Robinhood Markets Inc.’s 24-hour platform. Hong Kong shares and the yuan weakened as investors factored in an increase in trade tensions. Eastern European currencies posted some of the biggest losses on speculation that the region may have to increase defense spending. A cohort of investors on Wall Street have wagered that Trump’s stance on industrial policy, corporate tax cuts and tariffs would boost stocks and could fuel inflation — spurring bond yields and the US dollar higher. Crypto is seen as benefiting from relaxed regulation and Trump’s public support for the digital currency. “When I came in this morning, it was obvious many assets had decided Trump had already won,” said Luke Hickmore, investment director at Abrdn. “We might hit 5% on the US 10-year yield. Maybe even this year. People will realize inflation is going to rise as he pushes hard on the fiscal side.” Wall Street saw the potential for outsized moves almost regardless of the election’s outcome. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk said a Republican sweep may push the S&P 500 up by 3%, while a decline of the same size is possible should the Democrats win both the presidency and Congress. Moves would be half as much in the event of a divided government. Andrew Tyler at JPMorgan Securities said anything other than a Democratic sweep is likely to cause stocks to rise. A Morgan Stanley note says risk-taking appetite may dip in the event of a Republican sweep as fiscal concerns fuel yields, but if bond markets take it in their stride the likes of growth-sensitive cyclical stocks would rise. Meanwhile, it sees renewable-energy firms and tariff-exposed consumer stocks rallying under a scenario in which Harris emerges the victor with a divided Congress, while a corresponding fall in yields would benefit housing-sensitive sectors.

Chemicals supplier is cutting costs by slashing dividends by 95% and will idling production plants. Celanese said it faced \"persistent demand weakness\" in the previous quarter, and anticipates that will continue in the current one.  Celanese (CE) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 on Tuesday after the chemicals supplier posted results that were worse than expected, slashed its dividend, and said it would cut production because of falling sales. The company reported third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $2.44, with revenue down 2.8% to $2.65 billion. Both were short of forecasts. Celanese said it faced “persistent demand weakness across key end-markets like paints, coatings, and construction, as well as rapid and acute downturns in Western Hemisphere automotive and industrial segments.” The news sent Celanese shares down some 25% in afternoon trading, leaving them off about 40% this year and at their lowest point in about two years. The company said it would continue to \"take actions commensurate with the current demand environment” — which includes temporarily slicing its quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share by 95% in the first quarter of 2025. It also plans to reduce manufacturing costs through the rest of the year by temporarily suspending production at facilities in every region and raising $200 million through an inventory release this quarter. Celanese said that it would take other cost-cutting measures. CEO Lori Ryerkerk said that in the third quarter the company “faced a severely constrained demand environment that, in some cases like auto, degraded swiftly.\" She warned that \"we expect demand conditions to worsen in the fourth quarter.” Celanese anticipates current-quarter EPS of $1.25, less than half of what analysts at Visible Alpha estimated.

        "body": "U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday as voters headed to the polls on the last day of the presidential election and as more data piled up showing the economy remains solid. The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to pull closer to its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 427 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.4%. The market’s main event was the election, even if the result may not be known for days or weeks as officials count all the votes. Such uncertainty could upset markets, along with an upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time. Investors have already made moves in anticipation of a win by either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. But Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, suggests not getting caught up in such pre-election moves, or even those immediately after the polls close, “which we believe will face inevitable tempering, if not outright reversals, either before or after Inauguration Day.” Dow futures were up 0.7%, those in the S&P 500 were up 0.6% and those in the Nasdaq rose 0.4% as of 8:20 p.m. Eastern time as election returns were coming in. Trump won Florida, a one-time battleground that has shifted heavily to Republicans in recent elections. He also notched early wins in reliably Republican states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana, while Harris took Democratic strongholds like Vermont, Massachusetts and Maryland. In Asia, some benchmarks were moving higher in early trading Wednesday. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo was 1.4% higher, while the Kospi in Seoul was up 0.5%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.8%. Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind the former president’s Truth Social platform, tumbled 10.4% in after-hours trading. It closed 1.2% lower during the regular session, when trading in the stock was halted multiple times due to volatility. The stock, which tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its own profit prospects, rallied strongly last month. Bond yields were rising. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 4.35% as of 8:20 p.m. Eastern. It had earlier slipped to 4.28% from 4.29% late Monday. Despite all the uncertainty heading into the final day of voting, many professional investors suggest keeping the focus on the long term. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, even if each party’s policies can help and hurt different industries’ profits.

The stock broke down below a falling wedge pattern late last month on the highest weekly volume since late August, suggesting selling conviction behind the move. Investors should watch crucial support levels on Super Micro Computer's chart around $23, $12, and $10, while monitoring a key resistance area near $30. Shares in Super Micro Computer (SMCI) tumbled in extended trading Tuesday after the troubled server maker provided preliminary fiscal first-quarter results that came in below Wall Street expectations and said it’s unable to predict when it will file its delayed 2024 annual report. Tuesday’s updates follow a turbulent period for the company, which last week saw its shares plunge around 45% after its auditor, Big Four accounting firm EY, resigned. That move came as speculation continues to mount over corporate governance challenges facing Super Micro amid allegations of accounting abnormalities Super Micro Computer shares fell 16% to $23.30 in after-hours trading Tuesday. The stock, once an up-and-coming artificial intelligence (AI) favorite that hit a high around $123 in March, was down slightly year-to-date through Tuesday's close. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Super Micro Computer’s weekly chart and point out major price levels to watch out for. After trading within a six-month falling wedge, Super Micro Computer shares broke down below the pattern late last month. Importantly, the move occurred on the highest weekly volume since late August, suggesting strong selling conviction among larger market participants, such as institutional investors and hedge funds. Despite an early-November bounce, the stock sits poised to test lower levels again on Wednesday following the company’s latest updates. Let’s identify several crucial support levels and a key resistance area on Super Micro’s chart that investors may be watching. Firstly, it’s worth keeping an eye on the $23 level. This key location on the chart finds a confluence of support near the 200-week moving average and a trendline linking the lower level of a period of consolidation in the stock between May and October last year. A decisive breakdown below this level opens the door for a move down to around $12, where the shares could attract buying interest near a series of highs in March and April last year that formed as part of the stock’s impulsive move higher from January to July.

Analysts worry the company may be overvalued, with many maintaining sell or equivalent ratings despite a strong quarter. Deutsche Bank said the company benefits from “a more entrenched retail investor following relative to everything else we cover.”  Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares rocketed higher Tuesday after last night's earnings results comfortably beat expectations. Some analysts remain wary that the analytics software provider is overvalued. “There's no denying that [Palantir] is deserving of a premium valuation,” wrote analysts at Mizuho after the company delivered revenue growth of 30% and raised its 2024 guidance. However, they said, it is \"increasingly difficult to justify\" the shares' valuation. Mizuho, which has an \"underperform” rating on the shares, raised its price target to $37 from $30—which, however, still calls for the shares to decline. The stock was recently up some 20% to about $50, more than tripling this year; the mean price target tracked by Visible Alpha is closer to $33. Deutsche Bank analysts raised their price target to $26 from $21. Palantir, they wrote, benefits from what it calls “a more entrenched retail investor following relative to everything else we cover.” Palantir trades at roughly double the multiple of the next most-expensive stock the bank covers, the analysts said. CEO Alexander Karp said the company, “absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won’t slow down.” The company's U.S. commercial revenue grew 54% to $179 million in the period, and its U.S. government revenue improved 40% to $320 million.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers Watchdogs are readying the penalty after the iPhone maker failed to allow app developers to steer users to cheaper deals and offers outside of the App Store, according to people familiar with the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The penalty, under the tough new Digital Markets Act, is set to come just months after Cupertino, California-based Apple was hit with a €1.8 billion ($2 billion) fine for similar abuses under the bloc’s traditional competition rules — involving music streaming service Spotify. The European Commission could still unleash the fine before current EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is due to leave office later this month, according to the people. But there was a chance it could be pushed back to later this year, they said. The fine could also be accompanied by periodic penalty payments, levied on Apple until it complies with the law, said the people, adding that the decision was still being drafted. Apple spokespeople didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The European Commission declined to comment. The move follows a warning to Apple in June that it must give developers effective means to steer users away from its App Store, or face future penalties. In contrast to traditional antitrust law, the DMA is designed to head off anticompetitive behavior before it is too late to wreck markets for good. Under the law, EU regulators have powers to fine the world’s most powerful tech firms 10% of their global annual sales, 20% in the event of repeated infringements, or periodic fines of as much as 5% of the average daily revenue. In fourth quarter results posted last week, Apple reported sales of $94.9 billion, compared with an average estimate of $94.4 billion. Revenue from the iPhone came in at $46.2 billion, beating estimates of $45 billion. Apple shares rose less than 1% to $223.45 at the close in New York on Tuesday. They are up 16% this year. Vestager has locked horns with Apple several times during her period in Brussels. In the Spotify dispute, she accused Apple of blocking its rival from informing users of cheaper deals away from Apple’s App Store.            ",

        "body": " Super Micro Computer reports earnings after the bell Tuesday, with its stock nearly 80% below its highest point in March. The few analysts covering the stock mostly have a cautious view of its outlook, but expect it will regain some of the value it has lost in recent months. Concerns with the company's accounting practices have sent the stock lower amid a report from a short seller, delayed filings, and the recent resignation of EY as its auditor.  Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is set to report earnings after the bell as it looks to turn around the stock's recent slide and address concerns about its accounting practices. Analysts have a cautious view of the server manufacturer. Three of the four analysts tracked by Visible Alpha gave the stock a \"hold\" rating, and the other analyst issued a \"sell\" rating. However, the average price target of $44.88 suggests that analysts expect the stock will recover from its recent losses, but not quite to the heights it reached earlier this year. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, analysts expect Super Micro will report revenue around $6.43 billion, more than triple last year's $2.12 billion. The tech company's profits are also expected to more than double to $414.67 million, compared to $157 million a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Super Micro's sales have benefitted from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom as demand for its hardware to power AI products has swelled, but its stock hasn't matched the performance of its surging sales in recent months as earnings have fallen short on higher costs. Also, questions have been raised about the company's accounting practices. After its stock had already tumbled in August, short seller Hindenburg Research issued a report accusing Super Micro of accounting manipulation and other issues. A day later, the company informed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the filing of its annual 10-K would be delayed. The company is also reportedly facing investigations from the Department of Justice (DOJ) into its accounting practices. Last week, the accounting firm EY resigned as Super Micro's auditor, citing a number of concerns with the results of its own investigation into Super Micro's accounting. Super Micro shares were up Tuesday afternoon to $26.25. That's narrowly below where they started the year, but nearly 80% lower than the heights of over $118 it reached in March. ",

The broad rally in stocks was consistent with votes past: the S&P 500 has gained on nine of the last 11 election days with a median return of 0.8%, according to Carson Group strategist Ryan Detrick. “Regardless of who wins tonight or whenever we get those results, it effectively is going to be a surprise,” Cameron Dawson at NewEdge Wealth told Bloomberg Television. “Those polls are so very tight, which means that it could be volatility-inducing event.” Investors are reluctant to commit to sizable positions until at least the release of the initial exit polls, said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury. “The US election rests on a knife-edge as Americans head to the polls, with the outcome now seemingly anyone’s guess,” he said. Wall Street was preparing for a long night of potentially contentious ballot counting and sharp swings no matter the outcome. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said there’s a possibility of a burst of volatility in the aftermath of the election, but also pointed to the resilient US economic backdrop as likely to support equities in the long run. The team of strategists led by Andrea Ferrario said there’s just an 18% chance of a bear market in the next 12 months — even when taking into account the risks posed by Tuesday’s presidential election. “Equities should be able to digest higher bond yields as long as they are driven by better growth,” the Goldman strategists wrote in a note.

        "body": "US stocks closed Tuesday's trading session in a sea of green as Americans flocked to the polls on Election Day to decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will become the next president. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising about 1.4% to secure its best day since early October. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 1.2%, with the index nabbing its best session since Sept. 19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped 1%, or more than 400 points, as stocks rebounded from a losing day. Americans are heading to the polls with Harris and Trump running neck-and-neck after an intensely contested presidential race. Investors are buckling in for market volatility, as the outcome may not become clear for days, or even weeks, if the result is disputed. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Given the huge difference in the candidates' stances on the economy, a long wait for a declared winner could inject more uncertainty into markets. But historically, while the lack of a clear victory has brought turbulence in the short term, it has rarely halted the long-term trend for gains. The dollar (DX-Y.NB) retreated further on Tuesday as traders dialed back bets on a Trump win. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury (^TNX) dropped 2 basis points to hover around 4.29%. It had moved as high as 4.36% earlier in the session before retreating by late afternoon. Also dead ahead is the November policy decision from the Federal Reserve, which also has a lot at stake on Election Day. Chair Jerome Powell is overwhelmingly expected to bring in a 25 basis point rate cut at the end of the two-day meeting on Thursday. In corporates, the bitter seven-week strike at Boeing (BA) has ended after factory workers voted for a new contract offering a 38% pay hike. The plane maker's shares still nearly 3% after initially opening the day higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock fell about 10% in after-hours trading after the company missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings and sales in the current quarter. Super Micro said it expects second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.65, below analysts estimates of $0.80. Meanwhile, Super Micro's forecast for net sales in a range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion was weaker than the $6.79 billion on Wall Street had hoped for. The earnings were released less than a week after accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned as Super Micro's auditor. EY said in a filing it was \"unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management.\" Super Micro responded to those accusations on Tuesday with a response from an independent \"Special Committee\" that had been investigating the accusations. \"Following a three-month investigation led by Independent Counsel, the Committee’s investigation to date has found that the Audit Committee has acted independently and that there is no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors,\" the release said. \"The Committee is recommending a series of remedial measures for the Company to strengthen its internal governance and oversight functions, and the Committee expects to deliver the full report on the completed work this week or next.\" Additionally, Super Micro still hasn't filed its 10-K annual filing, which it initially pushed back on Aug. 29. The company said it \"remains unable at this time to predict when the Form 10-K will be filed.\" US stocks closed firmly in the green on Tuesday as investors flocked to the polls to decide who will become the next president: Republican nominee Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising about 1.4%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped 1%, or more than 400 points, as stocks rebounded from a losing day. The S&P 500 is up a little more than 1% as Americans and anxiously await results on the 2024 presidential race. The rally Tuesday furthered a trend that's been seen for most of the year in the major indexes. Through October, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) had risen about 20%, good for its best gains in the first 10 months of an election year through at least 1950. Strategists have warned that this up-and-to-the-right rally could be tested should the election not be decided quickly. But once an outcome is known, markets typically rally. The S&P 500 has been higher the month after the election in 6 of the past 10 cycles, per research from Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick. Over the next three months, the S&P 500 was higher 8 of 10 times. \"We could see a jolt of volatility and a knee-jerk reaction once there is more clarity on the election outcome or if the election results take longer to be known,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner wrote in a note to clients on Monday. \"Regardless, our view is investors should continue to focus on the primary trend and try to filter out the short-term noise.\" Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) was halted for volatility in late afternoon trading on Tuesday as investors brace for more wild swings with Election Day underway in the US. Shares quickly erased 15% gains and reversed Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday, which shaved off around $4 billion from its market cap. Shares have still more than doubled from their September lows. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $34 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $6.9 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $4.1 billion. Boeing (BA) shares retreated from modest gains in late afternoon trading on Tuesday after the company struck a deal with its machinists union Monday evening. 59% of the group voted to approve the deal and end the nearly two-month-long strike, which cost the company billions. While the union did not get the restoration of pensions it fought for, workers will receive a 38% wage increase over the next four years, a $12,000 cash bonus to hourly workers, and a boost in contributions to retirement savings plans. Analysts said the resolution of the strike should set the stage for a Boeing recovery. The stock has declined roughly 40% since the start of the year. \"Boeing CEO, Kelly Ortberg, added another check to the 'Boeing Turnaround' list,\" Bank of America analysts wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, although the group warned that any type of recovery won't happen overnight. \"While the strike ending and workers returning to the shopfloor is a meaningful step in the right direction, ramping [production] back up will take time.\" Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: New economic policy promises typically aren't rolled out during the final weeks of a presidential campaign. But that's one more norm Donald Trump and his allies have been upending in recent days. The pledges have been coming fast and furious, including one last escalation of Trump's tariff promises on the final day of campaigning, with the former president pledging to impose new blanket tariffs on Mexico. \"You're the first ones I've told it to,\" Trump told a crowd in Raleigh, N.C., on the last full day of campaigning Monday. \"Congratulations, North Carolina.\" It's a pledge that came alongside recent discussions from Trump and his allies of dramatically changing course on a signature Biden-era semiconductor bill that has catalyzed over $400 billion in semiconductor sector investments. There has even been renewed talk of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Whether all of this helps Trump's chance in a toss-up contest remains to be seen, but it's yet another factor for last-minute voters to consider as the 2024 contest reaches its end. Read more here. In addition to Palantir (PLTR) and Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), some of Tuesday's key stock movers included newly public AI hardware firm Astera Labs (ALAB), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and other AI chip stocks. Shares of Nvidia jumped 2.5% midday, while its manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), rose 2.9%. Chip stocks, including Intel (INTC), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM), also rose amid further evidence of strong AI data center demand evidenced by Astera Labs' sunny third quarter earnings Monday. Astera Labs itself was a top gainer Tuesday, rising roughly 30%. Meanwhile, Tesla shares rose 4% as the US presidential election outcome loomed. Analysts' takes were mixed on how Tesla would fare under either candidate — with some seeing the company benefiting from a Trump presidency while others say the EV industry would suffer under Trump. Its CEO, Elon Musk, has been one of Trump's key surrogates in the final months of the campaign. Asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) jumped 6% after quarterly earnings showed its assets reached $733 billion. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) On the other side of the spectrum, Tuesday's major losers were mining giant Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) — which saw shares fall more than 7% after an earnings miss in part due to its exposure to the auto industry — and drugmaker AstraZeneca (AZN) — which is attempting to break into the massive weight-loss drug market. Its stock fell as much as 7% in response. Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (XLK) led Tuesday's sector action, with stocks moving higher across the board as Election Day gets underway. The so-called Trump and Harris trades also saw some movement. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) moved about 5 basis points higher to trade around 4.35%. Yields are largely expected to remain elevated under a Trump administration since the former president's tariff policy would likely lead to higher inflation over time. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which Trump has outwardly supported, saw prices rise around 4% to trade near $70,300 a token. Prices have been lumpy in recent days, however, as Kamala Harris's odds improved over the weekend. Given that recent movement, Utilities (XLU) have dropped around 2% over the past five days. Utilities typically fall on higher yields, so if the assumption is that a Harris presidency would be less inflationary compared to Trump, that would lead to a drop in yields and, therefore, the Utilities sector at large. Palantir (PLTR) stock surged 22% after the company's third quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street's expectations due to a spike in spending from the US Department of Defense on its artificial intelligence tech. Palantir’s chief revenue and legal officer, Ryan Taylor, said the company's US government business saw its “strongest sequential growth in 15 quarters driven largely by our DoD [Department of Defense] business's 21% quarter-over-quarter growth.” Global government spending on Palantir’s products, primarily from the US, rose 40% from the prior year to $408 million in the third quarter, accounting for 56% of the company’s total revenue for the period. This was ahead of the $379 million expected for the segment, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Overall, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter, a penny ahead of expectations, on revenue of $725.5 million, which topped the $703.7 million expected by Wall Street analysts. Read the full story here. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) climbed more than 10% higher in early trading on Tuesday, extending its double-digit rise to kick off the week as shares brace for more volatility with Election Day underway in the US. The stock suffered its largest percentage decline last week and closed down around 20% to end the five-day period on Friday, which shaved off around $4 billion from its market cap. Shares have still more than doubled from their September lows. The stock's recovery comes as investors await the election of the next president: Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. Prior to the recent volatility, shares in the company, the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform Truth Social, had been on a steady rise as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Prediction sites like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi all showed Trump's presidential chances ahead of those of Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris. That lead, however, narrowed significantly over the weekend as new polling showed Harris surpassing Trump in Iowa, which has historically voted Republican. And as betting markets tighten, national polls show both candidates in a virtually deadlocked race. Polls in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which are likely to decide the fate of the election, also show razor-thin margins. Here’s what the betting markets and election forecasters are saying as the 2024 campaign comes to an end. Political betting app Kalshi recently became the first place where Americans could legally wager on the 2024 election — and the bets have flooded in. Heading into Election Day, the site put Trump’s odds at 57% which was akin to “a very slightly biased coin flip,” Kalshi co-founder Tarek Mansour said in a Yahoo Finance appearance Monday A compilation of other betting markets from RealClearPolling, spanning other popular sites open to overseas betters from Polymaket to Smarkets, has the odds of a Trump win at 59.2% to 39.3%. Those odds mean that Harris would win almost four contests if the election were run 10 times. As for the polling-based election models, they projected a tighter race. Nate Silver’s Silver Bulletin model ran its last update at 12:00 a.m. ET on Nov. 5 and found a nearly exact tie in electoral college probability with Harris winning 50% of the time to 49.6% for Trump. Silver’s final run featured 80,000 simulations with Harris winning in 40,012 of them, he wrote. The 538.com election model was another toss-up. It found Harris winning 50 out of 100 simulations. Trump won 49 times out of 100 with a less than 1-in-100 chance of no Electoral College winner. The final analysis from the Economist magazine found a slight Harris edge with the vice President winning 56 out of 100 hypothetical contests. US stocks opened mostly higher on Tuesday as Election Day got underway. Markets are in wait-and-see mode when it comes to who will end up in the White House: Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, up 0.5%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) opened just above the flatline on the heels of a losing day for stocks.

        "body": "GXO Logistics Inc. sees an upward trend in the global freight market in 2025, encouraged by its growing customer base and organic sales growth in the third quarter. “We definitely are feeling that we’re out of the trough that we’ve been in for the last 12 months, and we’re getting back to a more normal kind of growth type of metric,” CEO Malcolm Wilson said during a call with analysts Tuesday. “We’re definitely building for a much stronger 2025.” Greenwich, Connecticut-based GXO Logistics (NYSE: GXO) is one of the largest pure-play contract logistics providers in the world. It has more than 970 facilities totaling approximately 200 million square feet, with a global workforce of more than 130,000 people. The company reported Monday that quarterly revenue surged 28% year over year to $3.16 billion. Adjusted third-quarter earnings per share was 79 cents, compared with 69 cents for the third quarter in 2023. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations for the quarter, which had estimated revenue of $3.03 billion and adjusted EPS at 78 cents per share. GXO saw third-quarter organic revenue growth of 3%, which has accelerated sequentially throughout the year, said CFO Baris Oran. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $223 million, a 12% year-over-year increase compared with $200 million for the third quarter of 2023. “The improving trajectory reflects the growing contribution of new facility startups each quarter, and we expect it to continue as we move into 2025,” Oran said. “We have also seen sequential margin expansion throughout the year, and we expect this trend to continue as we see a margin uplift due to a better space utilization in our multitenant network.” For full-year 2024, GXO’s guidance expects organic revenue growth of 2% to 5%, adjusted EPS of $2.73 to $2.93 and adjusted EBITDA of $805 million to $835 million. While revenue and earnings per share increased during the quarter, GXO’s net income fell 48% year over year to $35 million. The company also has $2.8 billion in outstanding debt and $2.2 billion in net debt. GXO’s customers include Gymshark, LG Corp., L’Oreal and Zalando. The company recently expanded its partnership with Zalando and opened the largest outsourced e-commerce warehouse in France, Wilson said. “Our sales pipeline has grown 30% year over year and now stands at over $2.4 billion of high-quality opportunities, its highest level in more than two years,” Wilson said. The e-commerce marketplace drove significant third-quarter revenue gains, GXO officials said.      ",

Trump, 78, declared victory at around 2:30 am Eastern time after the Associated Press called the state of Pennsylvania in his favor, putting him just shy of the 270 seat Electoral College threshold that would sweep him into the White House. He is also on track to possibly win the popular vote. Projections also suggest that Republican lawmakers would re-take control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, setting up a so-called 'red wave' that would allow his economic agenda to move quickly to fruition when he assumes office in late January as the 47th President. \"America have given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,\" Trump told his supporters. \"This was the greatest political movement of all time.\" Brandon Bell/Getty Images Stock futures reacted to the seemingly decisive win, particularly given the nature of House and Senate races, while markets around the world braced for the impact of Trump's promised tariff and trade protection policies under a new administration.

The analysts say a healthy economic backdrop would help stocks digest higher bond yields. Higher yields are a risk to stocks and are more likely if Trump wins the election, analysts say. Investors may be nervous about election-related volatility, but the market is in good shape to avoid a steep drop into bear market territory after the vote, Goldman Sachs said. The analysts said they see just an 18% chance that stocks fall more than 20%, which would signal the start of a bear market. They point to the continuation of a healthy economy that's helped push stocks higher this year. \"Despite recent weaker macro data (in part due to strikes and hurricanes last month), the friendly US macro backdrop should limit the risk of a bear market,\" the analysts said in a Monday note. They said that even if bond yields rise considerably after the election, stocks should continue to do fine, though a more rapid increase in bond yields or real yields could pose a more outsize risk. \"Equities should be able to digest higher bond yields as long as they are driven by better growth. That said, rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid,\" the analysts said. Analysts and economists think higher bond yields — which are a headwind for stocks — are likely if Trump wins. His proposals for sweeping tariffs and mass deportations would be inflationary and could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to continue easing monetary policy. A Harris win with a split Congress, on the other hand, would likely result in lower bond yields, the analysts say. The central bank delivered a jumbo rate cut in September, and is widely expected to cut by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its meeting on Thursday. The path of the easing cycle after that is less certain, as some strategists have warned the Fed could hit pause on rate cuts in December or early next year. though some still see another jumbo rate cut in the cards as the economy slows and the labor market weakens. The Goldman analysts said stocks have been able to digest rising bond yields so far. Their call for stocks to avoid a bear market comes as the S&P 500 has surged over 21% this year, with the bull rally turning two years old last month. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remain virtually tied in final polls. Investors are bracing for election-related market volatility if the result of the vote is unclear for several days. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

        "body": "By Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) - S&P 500 futures touched a record high in sharp and broad-based rally on Wednesday after Republican Donald Trump claimed victory in the U.S. presidential election. Fox News projected that he had defeated Democrat candidate Kamala Harris although other news outlets are yet to call the race for Trump. As election results started to trickle in, so-called Trump trades rallied, U.S. Treasury yields surged, bitcoin hit a record high and the dollar gained. [US/] \"Markets absolutely crave certainty,\" said Dr. David Allen, portfolio manager, Plato Global Alpha Fund, adding that a Trump victory was likely \"priced in at the margins\". At 3:35 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 986 points, or 2.33%, U.S. S&P 500 E-minis were up 117.25 points, or 2.02% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 337.25 points, or 1.66%. Futures tracking the small cap Russell 2000 soared 5.1% to the highest levels since early 2022, with the more domestic-focused stocks expected to benefit from an easier regulatory and tax regime, as well as be less-exposed to potential import tariffs. The Republican party also gained control of the U.S. Senate, and posted early gains in the battle to maintain control in the House of Representatives. A so-called \"clean sweep\", in which one party captures the presidency, the House and the Senate would give Trump an easier route to push through desired legislation. \"I do think Trump 2.0 will be different from Trump 1.0... I expect him to push through a lot of fast major legislation within the first 100 days, so hold on to your hats,\" Allen said. Analysts assume Trump's plans for restricted immigration, tax cuts and sweeping tariffs if enacted would put upward pressure on inflation and bond yields, while corporations could benefit from his tax and regulatory policies. Tesla's Frankfurt-listed shares soared 13%, with investors betting on the stock as top shareholder Elon Musk has supported Trump throughout his electoral campaign.

The median U.S. homebuyer is now 56, up seven years from 49 last year, according to a Monday survey from the National Association of Realtors. In the 2010’s, the typical homebuyer was in their low to mid-40s. These older buyers are also slightly wealthier, with a median household income of $108,800, up from 107,000 in 2022. First-time buyers, who in the 1980’s were still in their late 20’s, are now around 38 years old, up from 35 last year. And older first-time buyers who can afford homes also had a higher median household income of $97,000, compared to $95,900 a year ago, according to the survey. The median age for repeat buyers also jumped to 61, up from 58 last year. Their income also increased, coming in at $114,300, compared to $111,700 a year ago. The ages of the median typical homebuyer, the median first-time buyer, and the median repeat buyer were all at all-time-highs. The rising age of the American homebuyer comes as home prices and mortgage rates have skyrocketed since the pandemic. The median selling price for a home is now up 39% since 2020 at $435,000, according to the NAR, while the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage has skyrocketed to about 6% from under 3% in 2020. The lack of development across the country has also kept prices high as the housing supply remains low. Even the once affordable Midwest and Sunbelt cities are increasingly out of reach for most Americans. Half of the ZIP codes in some of the biggest cities in these regions are at least four times as expensive as the median household income in the metro area, according to a study by The Hustle. As younger buyers get increasingly priced out of the housing market, more are renting or living with their parents. Yet, those that were able to buy a first home pre-pandemic feel like they are stuck in their starter home because of interest-rate increases that have hit since then. Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a plan to boost construction of new homes across the country while also offering $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time buyers. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has proposed opening up federal land for massive housing construction. After the Federal Reserve cut rates in September by half a percentage point, mortgage rates plummeted. Yet, rates have since increased, in part because of fears that inflation could rebound if Trump is elected president. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com ",

However, there’s reason to believe that the stock could have more room to run ahead of it. I’m bullish on Instacart based on its strong long-term growth potential, its innovative new offerings for advertisers (which could unlock additional value), and its excellent Smart Score. There’s a good chance you’re likely already familiar with Instacart. The $11.5 billion company provides online grocery shopping services to households in North America. It connects consumers with personal shoppers to shop and deliver groceries and other products through both its mobile app and its website. Connecting consumers with personal shoppers for grocery delivery is a simple yet effective business model. Yet, it’s one that the company could just be scratching the surface of, which is a reason why I am bullish. While Instacart has become something of a household name for many, online grocery sales currently only account for about 12% of the industry’s sales. Instacart believes that this ratio could double in the years ahead, which would represent enormous growth potential for the company as groceries are a $1.1 trillion market in the United States. While the online grocery business is lucrative and in its early innings, there’s more to Instacart than simply delivering groceries – the company has an intriguing growth driver in its bag of tricks. Instacart and streaming platform Roku (ROKU) recently announced an expanded partnership that will offer advertisers in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) space “interactive ad formats, enhanced targeting capabilities, and closed-loop measurement” of effectiveness. Instacart and Roku explain that this format means “consumers are one step closer to effortless and personalized shopping experiences while watching TV in the comfort of their homes.” The new offerings include shoppable ads, which create a “direct path” from ad to purchase via either text message or QR code, which take the viewer to Instacart. These shoppable ads have the potential to be extremely effective and attractive to advertisers. Imagine a hungry consumer streaming their favorite show, seeing an ad for their favorite snack (or a new one that piques their interest), and using the QR code to instantly order it from Instacart via a seamless experience that removes any friction in the consumer journey. Additional capabilities include ads on the high-traffic Roku home screen that take viewers directly to the product’s page on Instacart, and better targeting for ads based on Instacart purchase history and behavior.

Such a result would make it harder for either candidate to implement proposals. \"Under either gridlock scenario, we think equities reprice higher,\" the firm wrote. Regardless of the next president, JPMorgan expects stocks to rise if the US election delivers a divided Congress. \"Under either gridlock scenario, we think equities reprice higher as we clear the uncertainty, volatility decreases and hedges unwind, with investors refocusing on the Fed at a time when the economy and corporate earnings remain resilient,\" analysts led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said in note published Sunday. As of Tuesday morning, polling shows a neck-to-neck race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Without a clear outcome, Wall Street could be headed toward two sharply different investing environments, given each candidate's contrasting policy ideas. However, Congressional gridlock would make it harder for either presidential candidate to implement their proposals as easily as they could under a Democratic or Republican-held Congress. \"I think the stock market has to be concerned if we get a sweep by the Democrats or a sweep by the Republicans,\" market veteran Ed Yardeni told Bloomberg TV last month. He added: \"So I think the stock market will do best if we basically vote for gridlock, that whoever's in the White House just doesn't have an open season to do whatever they want.\" To JPMorgan's point, investors have been preparing for the possibility of a red or blue sweep. For instance, tariff-sensitive consumer equities have been underperforming in anticipation of a potential Trump win. The Republican candidate has pledged to implement sweeping taxes on all US imports. Under a Trump presidency and a divided Congress, JPMorgan expects domestic and energy equities to be more sensitive. CHIPS Act beneficiaries and multinational companies are more sensitive under a Harris presidency and divided Congress. If a deadlocked Congress helps ease uncertainty over extreme policy changes, investors can once again focus on trading over macroeconomic factors. As JPMorgan noted, all eyes will turn to the Federal Reserve this week. The central bank is expected to implement a 25-basis-point interest rate cut this week.

M2 money supply is shrinking, an indicator that's typically favored defensive stocks, strategists said. Investors should look at sectors like healthcare and consumer staples, they said. The economy has been flashing a warning sign for more than a year — and it's telling investors that they should be paying more attention to a particular area of the stock market, according to Ned Davis Research. Strategists at the firm pointed to the contraction in the money supply, a measure of how much money is flowing around in markets and the economy. The economy's stock of M2, one class of the money supply, has been shrinking in real terms since the start of 2022. Historically, that signal has preceded the start of a recession, and has typically indicated an environment in which defensive stocks outperform cyclical stocks, the firm wrote in a report. The M2 money supply has been distorted since the early days of the pandemic, the firm said. In 2020 and 2021, the Fed grew its balance sheet, which added to the money supply. But the central banks has been trimming their balance sheet since it kicked off its fight against inflation, reducing some of the excess liquidity in markets. \"Stocks have generally performed better when real M2 money supply is rising. Similarly, sector leadership has tended to be more cyclical when y/y growth has been at high levels,\" the report said. \"While the growth rate has been moved higher in 2024, it remains in contraction territory, at levels supporting defensive stock leadership.\" That suggests investors should be heading into sectors like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, with the latter two sectors being the best-performing when the M2 money supply is running below its long-term average, the strategists added. Other forecasters on Wall Street have pointed to the contraction in the money supply as a potential omen for the economy. Steve Hanke, a Johns Hopkins economist, recently predicted a recession by early 2025, pointing to the contraction in M2 as one of the warning signs. Still, the consensus on Wall Street is that the US economy looks to be on solid footing, with GDP expanding in the third quarter even as inflation continued to cool. Economists see the odds of a recession in the next year at just 33%, according to a third-quarter survey conducted by Bankrate. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

The company reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit boosted by its Intelligent Devices segment. Emerson also announced plans to acquire the remaining stake in industrial software firm AspenTech.  Emerson Electric (EMR) shares surged 7% on Tuesday, securing one of the top performances in the S&P 500, after the provider of automation equipment, industrial software, and engineering products reported strong sales and profit for its fiscal fourth quarter. Emerson also announced a proposal to buy the remaining stake of industrial software company Aspen Technology (AZPN), reflecting Emerson's strategic focus on the industrial automation market. Emerson's net sales for the recently completed quarter came in at roughly $4.6 billion, up roughly 13% year-over-year. Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.48 for the fiscal fourth quarter grew 15% from the year-ago period. Both figures exceeded analysts' consensus forecasts. Growth in the Intelligent Devices and Software and Control segments helped drive the strong performance. Emerson's chief executive officer (CEO) touted the successful integration of the company's test and measurement systems assets, highlighting $100 million in synergies over the first year. The company enhanced this part of its business through the October 2023 acquisition of software-connected test and measurement firm National Instruments. In 2021, Emerson merged its software units with competitor AspenTech and acquired a 55% position in the combined entity. The new proposal to buy out the remaining stake values AspenTech at a total of $15.1 billion, meaning the prospective transaction would cost Emerson just more than $6.5 billion. CFRA Research analysts reportedly said they were unsurprised by Emerson's desire to gain full control of AspenTech. In the wake of the pandemic and numerous high-profile labor disputes, manufacturers are likely to maintain their focus on automation, the analysts noted. Following Tuesday's gains, Emerson stock is trading more than 20% higher year-to-date. ",

        "body": "A host of world-changing inventions marked the first Industrial Revolution and the following century. The internal combustion engine is not the least important of them. It led to the growing availability of automobiles, which broadened the horizons of everyday life, enabling greater productivity, further and faster travel, and improved communication. Today, the automotive industry is more than just buying and selling automobiles. Its vibrant online markets deal in everything from cars and spare parts to maintenance services and insurance. The players here range from leading manufacturers to people from all walks of life. Another discovery that led to greater productivity plays a significant role in these online markets. That discovery is the power of automated public data collection. Mass production was the first driver of sales in the automotive industry. When Henry Ford figured out the optimal way to construct automobiles using the conveyors-belt assembly lines, it allowed offering prices affordable to a significantly larger audience. The automobile industry, as we know it, has started truly rolling. This innovation has touched two of the automotive industry's three main pillars: manufacturers and dealerships. As the industry matured, along with the DUY maintenance of automobiles, the third pillar emerged: spare parts and components manufacturing. Today, the scope of the automotive industry depends on the definition. Add all the services that support automobile maintenance, such as mechanic repair shops, car insurance, and shuttle services, and you are looking at an incredibly vast and diverse picture. The separate branches of this industry seem to be held together only by their connection to motor vehicles. However, there is another noteworthy common denominator. All these branches create and profitably use volumes of web data. Like motor vehicles a century earlier, the Internet emerged as the invention that brought the world even closer together. Its distance-defying power allows businesses and drivers to deal with and share information with a much broader audience. Those looking for a secondhand part of a specific vehicle model that manufacturers no longer make quickly appreciated the opportunities the web brings to automobile enthusiasts. However, all parts of the industry continue to find value in the Internet's reach. The global automotive e-commerce market is set to reach $176.24 billion by 2031, increasing 4.5 times in the decade leading up to it. Aside from online sales, the marketing capabilities and valuable data will certainly keep its players, big and small, drawn to the vast and fertile digital landscape.                   ",

The company faces a Nasdaq delisting deadline due to unfiled financial statements. \"It arguably appears to be an uphill battle for SMCI to remain listed at this point,\" an analyst said. Super Micro Computer, a darling of the artificial intelligence trade, has seen its stock tumble sharply after a 1,600% rally, and now faces delisting following the resignation of its auditor last week. Shares of the company have crashed 79% from their peak, plummeting further last week after accounting firm EY said it would resign as the company's auditor. \"We are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee's representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management,\" the accounting firm said in a filing. Super Micro Computer failed to file financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission that were originally due in August. Per Nasdaq rules, the company has until November 20 to submit a plan to the exchange for it to get back into compliance. If approved, it could push the deadline to early next year. Shares of Super Micro Computer dropped 2% on Tuesday, extending its weeklong decline to 48%. The stock was trading at about $26.20 around noon ET. With such a negative overhang for the stock, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said investors probably won't care about its quarterly results until key questions are answered. \"We believe questions around EY's decision, SMCI's ability to file its 10K, and a reported DOJ investigation will take precedence over SMCI's quarterly report and guide,\" Bryson said in a note on Monday. \"It arguably appears to be an uphill battle for SMCI to remain listed at this point,\" he added, noting EY's desire to distance itself from financial statements prepared by the company's management. This isn't the first time Super Micro Computer investors faced delisting concerns. In August 2018, the company announced a suspension of trading in its stock after it was delisted from the Nasdaq for failing to file its financial reports in a timely manner. Bryson said that another question for Super Micro Computer is whether its financial accounting woes could impact its underlying business of selling server racks filled with Nvidia's most powerful AI-enabled GPU chips. \"We have had mixed feedback regarding whether concerns around SMCI late filing and/or the reported DOJ investigation might be impacting customer's decisions,\" Bryson said.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index slid as much as 1.1% Wednesday, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan among the biggest drags on the benchmark. The losses came as Trump was projected as the winner of the US presidential election across pivotal swing states, with the Republican Party set to control the Senate. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index closed down 2.6%, leading losses in Asia. The decline in Hong Kong equities — which are more closely linked to external events and global money flows — reflected international investors’ concerns about a second term for Trump, which may bring about heightened trade tensions and policy surprises. Stocks listed in mainland China incurred narrower losses amid expectations of more stimulus measures from policymakers. In the latest signal of Beijing’s support for growth, China’s central bank chief pledged to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance and to double down on countercyclical adjustments to bolster the economy. Investors are keenly tracking a key Chinese legislature meeting this week that may unveil ramped-up fiscal spending. “If Trump does win, I think he will put pressure on Asian markets overall — clearly with a huge focus on China,” said Nick Twidale, chief analyst at AT Global Markets Australia. “Bigger players will want to square or have smaller exposure in the current market.” There are concerns among investors that another Trump presidency may keep inflation elevated and introduce high tariffs, complicating the Federal Reserve’s task to achieve price stability and boding ill for Asia’s export-driven economies. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan benchmark is up about 13% this year, trailing gains on Wall Street. Trump trades gaining ground “could be a mixed message for Asian equities,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets. “While his pro-growth policies could spill over the tailwinds to Asia, threats of tariffs and a stronger dollar will have be to assessed as well.” In Japan, stocks rallied after a stronger dollar weighed on the yen, which typically benefits the country’s export-oriented economy. Shares in Australia and India also advanced.                                             ",

Yesterday, the company reported third-quarter preliminary adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, compared with street view of $1.25. The company will restate previously filed fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q. The company said it has decided to postpone the webcast originally scheduled for November 5 at 9 a.m. Central Time. The restated filings will include corrections for newly identified errors related to intersegment sales, will reflect the previously-corrected errors, and will provide disclosures applicable to restated segment information. “Our third quarter operating results were mixed in a challenging quarter for the business,” said Chair of the Board and CEO Juan Luciano. Archer-Daniels-Midland said net earnings are expected to be $18 million, with adjusted net earnings forecasted at $530 million. The company also anticipates a $461 million non-cash charge against GAAP earnings for the third quarter related to its Wilmar equity investment. “We are taking the necessary actions to improve performance and drive continued value creation,” Luciano added.

        "body": "On Election Day as voters headed to the polls, the wild fluctuations that have become the hallmark of Trump Media & Technology Group's stock continued their dizzying course. The parent company of Truth Social was halted three times for volatility. Shares closed down 1%. A large portion of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's wealth is tied up in his majority stake in the parent company of Truth Social. Forbes estimates $3.9 billion of Trump's estimated $6 billion net worth is linked to his DJT shares. “What’s at stake is simple. If he loses, this goes to zero,” Tuttle Capital Management CEO Matthew Tuttle told USA TODAY. “If he wins, at this level I think you get a pop. I would sell into it though. They still need a business model that makes sense.” Temporary trading stops happen automatically when a stock moves suddenly beyond certain limits. Trump Media, which trades under the vanity ticker DJT, approached record territory last week as polls seemed to swing in Trump’s favor. When Vice President Kamala Harris appeared to gain momentum, shares suffered three days of heavy losses. The stock rose 12% Monday. “The volatility and the back and forth show that this is a close race and nobody has any clue who is going to win,” Tuttle said. Since the stock’s Wall Street debut nearly eight months ago, Trump Media has become not just a major source of the GOP nominee’s wealth but a barometer of his electoral chances, experts told USA TODAY. “It is a bellwether for differences of opinion about today’s presidential election,” University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter said. “Not only differences of opinion, but differences of hope.” Tuesday, Trump Media reported $1 million in third-quarter revenue and a $19 million net loss. The company has lost more than $363 million in the first nine months of the year. Trump’s stake in Trump Media is worth billions on paper. He has said he has “absolutely no intention of selling” his nearly 115 million shares. Trump has said he does not think he will run for the White House again in 2028 if he loses. In regulatory filings, Trump Media has telegraphed how critical Trump is to the company’s brand, warning that its value “may diminish” if Trump’s popularity falters. Trump Media has also cited Trump's divestment of DJT stock as one of the top risks to its business. If Trump were to sell his stake, it would result in a flood of shares that could drive down the stock price, observers say. Wall Street observers say Trump Media belongs to the meme stock phenomenon with traders driving up shares based on factors other than the underlying business fundamentals.     ",

        "body": "By Ananya Mariam Rajesh (Reuters) - Elf Beauty (ELF) is likely to report revenue growth of nearly 33% for the second quarter, bucking weak demand in the industry as its inexpensive cosmetics edged out competition. Expectations of strong sales from Elf are in stark contrast with legacy industry players such as Estee Lauder and L'Oreal that have reported declining sales, as consumers are shying away from buying pricey makeup and cosmetics in major markets including the U.S. and China. \"They have very broad distribution across online or e-commerce and store channels such as drug stores as well as big box retail ... they are where consumers are shopping,\" eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves said. The Oakland, California-based company's products are widely available at retailers such as Walmart, Target and even Amazon, while competition brands such as Coty and Maybelline by L'Oreal are typically sold at department stores. Analysts on average are expecting Elf's second-quarter sales to rise 32.6% to $285.8 million, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. This growth however is likely to be its slowest in eight quarters. Elf's stock, which rose almost 900% since mid-2022 till July's record high of $210.90, has since fallen 51% as analysts and investors flag concerns on stabilizing U.S. sales growth following the record high sales in the last two years. \"The growth rates that we see for them (Elf) are still materially above a lot of their peers. The shares have obviously been most penalized since last quarter despite clearly a strong beat and an outlook raise, but obviously not enough for a fairly demanding market,\" Olivia Tong, Raymond James analyst said. In the latest quarter, Estee withdrew its annual forecast and posted a 4.46% drop in sales, while L'Oreal missed estimates for quarterly sales, mainly due to a higher mix of high-end product offerings in their portfolio as well as weakness in China.

The Associated Press called that the former president secured North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania — three critical swing states. Results from Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan remain unclear. As of 4:00 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each soared around 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up around 2.6% on the heels of a winning day for stocks. Futures tied to the 10-year Treasury note (10Y=F), meanwhile, rose over 12 basis points to trade around 4.4%. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) also rallied to a record alongside a surge in the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) as the evening's returns bolstered the \"Trump trade.\" All states have now closed their respective polling stations. So far, the AP assesses that Trump has secured 267 electoral college votes, while Harris has claimed 224. Outside of the presidential election, Republicans have also flipped the Senate. Control of the House of Representatives remains unclear. Read more: The Yahoo Finance guide to the presidential election and what it means for your wallet Earlier this week, Harris and Trump made their final pitches to voters. Trump pledged last-minute tariffs and less money for chips while Harris promised to \"seek common ground\" in her final rally in Philadelphia on Monday. Tesla (TSLA) shares are surging 13% in pre-market trading as Donald Trump looks to be on the verge of winning the presidency again. The win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the pole position to shape the EV maker's future given his strong backing of Trump, or at least that is how Wall Street sees it early on. Says Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives in a note: \"We believe a Trump presidency would be an overall negative for the EV industry as likely the EV rebates/tax incentives get pulled, however for Tesla we see this as a huge positive. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years. Trump could also accelerate some of the FSD and autonomous initiatives for Tesla (and Waymo as well) if he wins the White House.\" For more on Tesla's roadmap under a potential Trump presidency, here is our chat on the topic on a recent episode of my Opening Bid podcast. Donald Trump took the stage in Palm Beach, Fl. in the early morning hours on Wednesday as he neared closer to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the presidential election. \"This is a movement like nobody’s ever seen before,\" he told the crowd in what sounded like a victory speech. \"[This is] forever the day the American people regained control of their country.\" The Associated Press has not officially called the election. So far, Trump has secured 267 votes compared to Kamala Harris's 224. US stock futures soared as the results of the US presidential election all but confirmed a Donald Trump victory over Kamala Harris. The former president secured North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, three critical swing states, according to the Associated Press (AP). Results from Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan remain unclear. Per the AP, Trump is just 3 electoral college votes short of clinching the win. As of 2:30 a.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) and S&P 500 futures (ES=F) each jumped around 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up over 2.0%. Republicans have won control of the Senate, the Associated Press projected early Wednesday. The GOP flipped a Democratic-held seat in West Virginia, as Republican Jim Justice won the open seat. In Ohio, meanwhile, Bernie Moreno unseated Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, and Democrats lost a key member of their coalition in the upper chamber (as my colleague Ben Werschkul detailed earlier in the blog). Seven seats hang in the balance, with Republicans looking for more gains. They are eyeing a pickup in Montana, where incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is trailing Republican challenger Tim Sheehy. Races in the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona remain too close to call. Democrats currently hold all those seats. Head over to the Yahoo News live blog for more election insights and updates. As US stock futures climbed late Tuesday, futures tied to the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RTY=F) were the star performer, rising as much as 3% to outpace their larger peers as investors bet on the likelihood that Donald Trump will win the presidential election. Companies within the index, which include regional banks and smaller domestic players, are expected to benefit from anticipated policies out of the Trump administration like lower taxes and cutting regulations. Tariffs that a Trump administration would also be expected to enact pushed the dollar higher overnight Tuesday, a benefit for small-cap companies that tend to be more levered to the domestic economy compared to more internationally oriented large-cap stocks. GOP challenger Bernie Moreno has defeated Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio, according to the Associated Press. It’s a victory that almost surely means Republicans will take control of the Senate in 2025, but one that also has consequences for the crucial Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee. That committee, which Brown currently leads, has been the scene of closely watched hearings in recent years, with top CEOs like JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon and Bank of America’s (BAC) Brian Moynihan forced to answer questions from lawmakers on a range of topics. Those hearings will surely continue in 2025 but now likely with a friendly lawmaker kicking off the questioning. The current GOP ranking member on that committee is Sen. Tim Scott. The South Carolinian has tended to be much friendlier to bank concerns, especially around banking regulations. It’s a handover that could have a keen impact on policy, especially if Donald Trump ends up winning back the White House. One top concern over the last year has been the proposed Basel III endgame requirements that would increase the reserve requirements on banks. Scott has often criticized the proposal, including leading a call on the Biden administration to withdraw it entirely. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped to all-time highs late Tuesday as bets on Donald Trump accelerated in prediction markets. The former president has captured 198 electoral college votes compared to Kamala Harris's 112, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Bitcoin prices soared over 8% to trade around $74,200 a token — leaping past its previous record of around $73,750 a coin on March 14. Other crypto-adjacent names moved in tandem with bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) moved over 4% higher in after-hours trading while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose over 3%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies like dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Ripple (XRP-USD) also jumped on the developments, rising 30% and 5%, respectively. Financial markets might be sniffing out a presidential win. One of the first big moves in markets on election night was a jump in the value of the US dollar (DX=F), which began strengthening around 7:45 p.m. ET. That occurred as the New York Times' prediction needle began to tilt slightly in Donald Trump’s direction, based on rising odds of Trump winning the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina. Other forecasts suggest a similar Trump edge. Here's the logic for a stronger dollar: Trump wants to impose new tariffs on more than $3 trillion worth of imports, which would push up prices and make inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Higher inflation generally means higher interest rates, and higher rates would draw more global investments to US securities because of the higher return. More demand for US assets boosts demand for the dollar, making it more valuable relative to other currencies. Still, this is an early move and does not mean Trump is destined for victory, though Harris is now unlikely to win in a landslide. Key swing states, including the \"blue wall\" of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in addition to North Carolina and Georgia, had not yet been called as of 10:25 p.m. ET. The Trump trade is rallying, with the US dollar (DX=F), bitcoin (BTC-USD), and equity futures all pushing higher as Trump secured 178 electoral college votes compared to Harris's 99, according to the latest calls from the Associated Press. Decision Desk HQ, a private company that projects election results, projected Trump to also win North Carolina, a key swing state. Bitcoin prices extended gains by over 7% to trade above $72,800, while the US dollar rose to its highest level since July. Against other currencies like the Japanese yen and the Mexican peso, the US dollar is up over 1%. Near 9:40 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose about 1.1%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) also jumped over 1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 1.2%. Political betting markets made a limited move toward Donald Trump early in what is expected to be a long election night. As of 9:15 p.m. ET, the odds on Kalshi.com, a political prediction market open to US citizens, stood at 68% in Trump’s favor, projecting he would win about 2 out of 3 hypothetical contests. The odds were similar on Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, sitting at 72.4% at 9:15 p.m. ET. It was a noticeable — but far from definite — jump on both sites from the odds earlier in the night before the polls closed when both markets showed Trump's odd about 10 percentage points lower. The surge in these markets was most evident a bit after 7:30 p.m. ET. Gains for Trump noticeably leveled off and largely held steady throughout the 8 p.m. hour. Both sites are continuing to accept bets throughout the night, with Kalshi touting that their main market now has over $280 million at stake. Citi analysts detailed “election trades to track,\" and YF's Rick Newman highlighted seven of them: solar energy, fossil fuels, deregulation, tariffs, inflation, antitrust, and housing. A reminder that while stocks don't care who the president is, and mostly like certainty, the election results will have implications across industries. Read more here. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 3% in after-hours trading as election results continued to pour in Tuesday night. More results are expected to be announced in the coming hours. Tech billionaire Musk, who serves as the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX and also owns social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has been outspoken about his support of Trump ahead of the election. Trump has even said he would consider a Cabinet position for Musk but that the businessman likely would not be able to serve \"with all the things he's got going on.\" Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder Doug Clinton told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination on Tuesday that \"it will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk.\" \"He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction,\" said Clinton, who is also managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \"I think if it goes against him — if Kamala Harris is elected president — I think it probably is a negative for him.\" It's possible Tesla could still benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a continuation of Biden's green energy push. As a result, if Trump loses, Musk could likely \"find some way to try to mend fences,\" Clinton said. \"Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world,\" he said. Tesla shares are up about 1% since the start of the year. The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump could come down to coin-flip odds and may not be known for hours (if not days). But that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of results that could sway markets. Everything from which party will lead key congressional committees to the sway that certain industries like cryptocurrencies will have in Washington, D.C., are also on the ballot. Curious what races Jamie Dimon and crypto executives will be watching most closely? Read on here. A lot of folks on the Street I have chatted up this week are bracing for a big move in markets Wednesday morning, as the belief is that the winner of the election will be known later on tonight. Moreover, either winner would be seen as a surprise for markets (weird how these things are viewed by investors). Take that with a grain of salt, as such groupthink could mean we don't get a big move in markets on Wednesday. Amid the action, I would keep a close eye on bond yields, as markets could very well take their direction from them, based on my conversations. It's a point the Goldman Sachs team made today in a note making the rounds this evening: \"The upcoming US elections could drive further upward pressure on global bond yields and indigestion for equities,\" said Goldman Sachs strategist Andrea Ferrario. Ferrario added, \"Rising bond yields might eventually become a speed limit for equities if real yields start to increase (vs. real GDP growth expectations) or if increases in bond yields are too rapid.\" Futures moved firmly into green figures on Tuesday evening as early results from the US presidential election rolled in while cryptocurrencies surged and the US dollar also gained. Near 8 p.m. ET, contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved roughly 0.5% higher. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were up about 0.7%. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) was also up as much as 4.5% to trade north of $71,000. The dollar was also stronger against most major currency pairs, including the yen and euro. So far, Trump has won Kentucky, West Virginia, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana, while Harris has claimed Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and Massachusetts, according to the Associated Press. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged more than 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday as early votes showed Trump clinch Kentucky and Indiana. The stock had a wild session during market hours after trading was halted several times due to volatility. Shares somewhat recovered from steeper losses but still closed down a little over 1%. Shortly after the market close, DJT reported third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. The company also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Read more here. via Colin Campbell of Yahoo News: Democrats hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate. To hold onto the majority in the chamber, Democrats will need 51 seats if Donald Trump wins or 50 seats if Kamala Harris is the victor. This will be a difficult path for Democrats because the key Senate races are largely fought on Republican-friendly territory, and the national party has already conceded the West Virginia seat held by outgoing Sen. Joe Manchin. Here are the races most observers are following: Arizona: Rep. Ruben Gallego (D) vs. former TV anchor Kari Lake (R)\nFlorida: Sen. Rick Scott (R) vs. former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D)\nMaryland: Former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) vs. Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D)\nMichigan: Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D) vs. former Rep. Mike Rogers (R)\nMissouri: Sen. Josh Hawley (R) vs. Marine veteran Lucas Kunce (D)\nMontana: Sen. Jon Tester (D) vs. Navy SEAL veteran Tim Sheehy (R)\nNebraska: Sen. Deb Fischer (R) vs. union leader Dan Osborn (I)\nNevada: Sen. Jacky Rosen (D) vs. Army veteran Sam Brown (R)\nOhio: Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) vs. businessman Bernie Moreno (R)\nPennsylvania: Sen. Bob Casey (D) vs. businessman Dave McCormick (R)\nTexas: Sen. Ted Cruz (R) vs. Rep. Colin Allred (D)\nWisconsin: Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D) vs. businessman Eric Hovde (R) Check out the Yahoo News liveblog > Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk confirmed Tuesday evening that he’ll be spending election night with Donald Trump as the results come in. “I'm headed to Florida,” he said on a livestream on X, formerly Twitter, early Tuesday evening. “I’ll just be there with President Trump and JD [Vance] and a bunch of other cool people,” he added. The comment confirmed an earlier New York Times report that Musk would he headed to Florida this evening. It’s the latest example of Musk’s extraordinarily close links with Trump in the final stages of the campaign after the world's richest man spent over $130 million with the aim of returning former President Trump to office. At a recent closely watched Madison Square Garden rally in New York City, Musk was the final speaker before Trump's wife, Melania, took the stage. Other prominent figures in Trump's orbit are set to be elsewhere Tuesday night, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who will spend at least the early part of the evening in his home state of Louisiana. Musk also added Tuesday evening that he’d just voted himself in south Texas, where his company SpaceX has a facility. The next crop of states have officially closed their respective voting polls: Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and Virginia, among a slew of others. The remaining states will close in the next few hours. All polling locations are set to close by 11 p.m. ET. I’m not an election forecaster, but I’ll make a 2024 election call based on polls and my own intuition. Since I’m publishing this for everybody to see, my fans can extol me — or my trolls can berate me — whether I’m right or wrong. Harris will win the electoral college vote, and while it will be close, for sure, in swing states, her electoral victory will be sizable. The main reasons I think that will be true: Momentum is breaking Harris’s way in the final days. Trump has made nonstop unforced errors. Maybe most importantly, women voters are going to punch way above their weight this year and put Harris over the top. The late-breaking Selzer poll in Iowa pointed to this. The House will follow Harris into the Democrats' column, by a thin margin. Coattail effect. The Senate will flip from Democratic to Republican control, by a one- or two-vote margin. Election math is simply terrible for Democratic Senate candidates this year. Markets will be fine with a divided government, which is basically a Goldilocks scenario, market-wise. Trump trades will unwind, including a sharp drop in shares of DJT (DJT). Interest rates could drop by 20 or 30 basis points on a Harris win, as the specter of inflation driven by potential Trump tariffs disappears. Yes, I could be wrong, and if so I’ll admit it tomorrow (or whenever we know). ",

        "body": "In August, the NFL approved new ownership rules that allow private equity firms to buy passive minority stakes in franchises. The decision came after franchises appreciated nearly 40x over the past 30 years and reached $5.93 billion on average, according to Sportico’s calculations. But NFL team values still have a long runway, according to one team owner. “These funds can get liquid in six years,” Jonathan Kraft, New England Patriots president, said at Sportico’s Invest in Sports Event at Nasdaq. “You probably won’t get 3-4x your money, but my guess is you’re going to get returns that beat the stock market over that period and without taking that much more risk.” More from Sportico.com Industry Convenes at Nasdaq for Sportico's 'Invest in Sports' Fox Sells Out Super Bowl LIX, With Ads Fetching Over $7 Million a Pop Sportico Brings Industry Leaders to Invest in Sports New York Kraft then joked that he is not an investment advisor, in case “the SEC is listening.” The August decision approved a handful of PE firms to buy up to 10% of individual teams. No single fund can invest in more than six teams, and the minimum hold period for each investment is six years. Kraft sees a future where the PE firms will all raise follow-on funds, and “they’ll just be rolling it.” Kraft highlighted the NFL’s international opportunity from a media standpoint as it expands to a potential 16 games that can carve out another TV package. Kraft and his father, Robert, have made the Patriots one of the NFL’s most successful clubs on and off the field. Robert Kraft paid a then-record $172 million in 1994 for the team. The Patriots have made 10 Super Bowls under Kraft ownership and won six titles. In August, Sportico valued the Patriots at $7.31 billion. Opening up NFL ownership has created potential liquidity for limited partnership stakes in the NFL. LP stakes have traditionally sold at a 20-30% discount to control transactions, but Jonathan Kraft sees a world where LP stakes sell at par or even premium to control deals. “Something that used to be completely illiquid and not something most family offices would look to play, and it has been completely flipped on its head,” Kraft said. Yet, Kraft highlighted the one big economic advantage with control ownership in sports team sales that historically has justified the premium. “Uncle Sam becomes your partner in buying the asset,” Kraft said based on the idea that current tax laws allow you to offset income in other businesses through depreciation rules.\n\n(This story has been updated in the headline.)

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround A team led by Andrea Ferrario see just an 18% chance of a decline of more than 20% for stocks — which would constitute a bear market — even when taking into account the risks posed by Tuesday’s presidential election. The S&P 500 has gained about 20% this year after surging nearly 25% in 2023, led by soaring megacap technology stocks. Evidence of a resilient US economy has kept the rally afloat, though bond yields have pushed higher this month amid doubts about the depth and extent of the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle as well as election uncertainty. “Equities should be able to digest higher bond yields as long as they are driven by better growth,” the Goldman strategists wrote in a note, though they warned there is a possibility of a burst of volatility in the aftermath of the US vote. The economic environment remains friendly despite recent signs of weakness, the strategists said. Job growth slowed to the weakest pace since 2020 in October, a month distorted by severe hurricanes and a major strike, and the path to cooler inflation continues to prove bumpy, recent data show. Still, the economy expanded at a robust pace in the third quarter, continuing several quarters of solid growth, and the unemployment rate has remained low.

The UK new car market was down by 6.0% in October to 144,288 new registrations, according to data released from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Year-on-year declines were recorded across all buyer types, with fleets falling for the second time this year, down 1.7%, and the low volume business market declining 12.8%. Private purchases continued their two-year long wane, down 11.8%, meaning fewer than four in 10 (38.8%) of new cars registered in the first ten months have gone directly to private buyers. The October market fall was driven by double-digit drops in petrol and diesel vehicle deliveries, down 14.2% and 20.5% respectively. However, uptake of hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles also fell, down 1.6% and 3.2%. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) were the only powertrain type to record growth, with a raft of new models driving the strongest growth this year, up 24.5% to reach a 20.7% share of the market. The SMMT points out that UK new car buyers now have more than 125 different BEV models to choose from – an uplift of 38% over the last 10 months. It also said that ‘huge manufacturer discounting’ means that around one in five BEV models now has a lower purchase price than the average petrol or diesel car, especially for buyers able to take advantage of schemes such as salary sacrifice. However, while BEV car sales in the UK have reached almost 300,000 in the first ten months, that represents 18.1% of the market – an increase on 2023, but still significantly short of the 22% target for this year and of the 28% which must be achieved in 2025 under the UK government’s zero emission vehicle mandate. GlobalData forecasts the UK car market will grow by around 3% to 2m units in 2024. That would follow an 18% rebound in 2023 as supply constraints caused by the global semiconductors crisis eased. In a statement on the October result, Mike Hawes, SMMT Chief Executive, said: “Massive manufacturer investment in model choice and market support is helping make the UK the second largest EV market in Europe. That transition, however, must not perversely slow down the reduction of carbon emissions from road transport. “Fleet renewal across the market remains the quickest way to decarbonise, so diminishing overall uptake is not good news for the economy, for investment or for the environment. EVs already work for many people and businesses, but to shift the entire market at the pace demanded requires significant intervention on incentives, infrastructure and regulation.”     ",

The Phase I study (NCT05203237), evaluating VK2735, reported a placebo-adjusted weight loss of 6.8% in the high-dose cohort after four weeks in 92 patients. The company announced the positive data for the dual glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R)/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist at ObesityWeek 2024, taking place in Texas, US, from 3 to 6 November. The trial investigated eight doses of the drug, ranging from 2.5mg to 100mg versus a placebo. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, with four patients on Viking’s drug and two on placebo discontinuing the trial. Viking Therapeutics said it will begin a 13-week Phase II study of its oral candidate in Q4 2024. The company’s shares rose by 7.44%, from a close of $72.88 on 1 November to an open of $78.30 on 4 November after the company shared the positive data. It then fell by 19.36% before market close after Deutsche Bank analyst James Shin said it could be “costly with capital requirements and expertise” beyond major competitors, reports Reuters. Last month, Viking CEO Brian Lian claimed the company is in conversations with manufacturers to ensure a “blockbuster” supply. Viking also revealed more data from its Phase II study of a subcutaneous version of VK2735. The 13-week VENTURE study (NCT06068946) showed a mean weight loss of 14.7% or 13.1% adjusted for placebo, in the high dose cohort. The company announced mid-stage data from the VENTURE study in February 2024 which sent the company’s stock price soaring by 80%. The mid-stage data showed average weight losses of 9.2kg, 10.7kg, 13.3kg, 14.6kg, and 1.8kg in the 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The company was previously considering a Phase IIb trial but after sharing such positive data, it will be progressing straight to a Phase III trial after receiving the green light from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to GlobalData, both oral and subcutaneous versions of VK2735 could become a direct competitor to Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro (tirzepatide), the only dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist currently approved. GlobalData is the parent company of the Clinical Trials Arena. The weight loss field is heavily dominated by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1ra's), with Eli Lilly’s drug and Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide being the front runners. Semaglutide, marketed at Ozempic for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Wegovy for obesity is predicted to raise $42.85bn in sales in 2030, according to GlobalData. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly’s candidate, marketed as Mounjaro for T2D and Zepbound for obesity, is predicted to bring in £57.65bn in the same year.     ",

Since reaching their early-September low, Dollar Tree shares have formed two distinct troughs around the same level on the chart, raising the possibility of a double bottom, a classic pattern that signals a potential upside trend reversal. Investors should monitor key resistance levels on Dollar Tree's chart around $77, $92, and $104, while watching a major support area near $63.  Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares moved higher ahead of Tuesday’s opening bell after the discount retailer reiterated its fiscal third-quarter outlook and said its chief executive officer was stepping down. The retailer said it had appointed chief operating officer Michael Creedon as its interim CEO to replace Rick Dreiling, who said he was standing down due to health challenges. The company also said it had made progress on its strategic review of Family Dollar, a general merchandise segment that has weighed on the retailer’s sales in recent years. The company sees net sales coming in between $7.4 billion and $7.6 billion, while expecting adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to range from $1.05 to $1.15, thanks to same-store sales tracking well throughout the quarter, even as price-conscious consumers continue to spend cautiously. Dollar Tree shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year though Monday’s close, with challenging macro conditions promoting the retailer in September to slash its full-year outlook. Shares were up 4% at $69.50 in premarket trading Tuesday. Below, we take a look at Dollar Tree’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify important price levels worth watching out for. Since reaching their early-September low, Dollar Tree shares have formed two distinct troughs around the same level on the chart, raising the possibility of a double bottom, a classic pattern that signals a potential upside trend reversal. More recently, the stock has staged a bounce from lows but ran into selling pressure just beneath the respected 50-day moving average, indicating caution amid ongoing uncertainties. However, as the stock looks set to test higher prices on Tuesday, let’s identify several key resistance levels on Dollar Tree’s chart and point out a major area of support to monitor if buying momentum subsides. Firstly, it’s worth eyeing the $77 level, a location on the chart where investors who purchased the stock near recent lows may look to lock in profits near the September swing high.      ",

Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround Barclays Plc expects between $40 billion to $60 billion worth of ‘fallen angels’ in 2025, industry parlance for companies that have lost their investment-grade ratings. It would be the highest level in nearly a decade, excluding 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. In the coming months, household names like Boeing Co., Paramount Global, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and Charter Communications Inc. are at risk of being downgraded, according to Barclays. Boeing got some relief after a machinists’ union agreed this week to end a strike, and after it raised more than $20 billion in equity markets last month. “It’s kind of this slow-moving car wreck,” said Hunter Hayes, chief investment officer at Intrepid Capital Management Inc. “Obviously, some of these bigger, on-the-cusp, IG names have had some issues — Boeing being the poster child. But there are a handful of them, and what’s interesting about it to us is just the size.” Boeing, Paramount and Charter declined to comment, while Warner Bros. didn’t reply to requests for comment. There have been $6 billion of fallen angels this year — the lowest since 1997, according to Barclays. Next year could be the first since 2021 where fallen angels outpace ‘rising stars’ — firms elevated to investment-grade, according to the bank. While the Federal Reserve cut rates in September, that came after a tightening campaign that started in 2022 that was the most aggressive in decades. Investors are turning their attention to a few high-profile investment-grade issuers that may get downgraded to junk, namely Boeing, Paramount, Warner Bros. and Charter, Barclays notes. The four make up just 2% of the US investment-grade index, according to the bank. But in junk-bond land, their debt would take up a sizable 11%, analysts led by Dominique Toublan wrote on Oct. 25. “It’ll be an interesting litmus test to see how well high-yield can absorb that,” said Hayes. “But I think it’s healthier this way than to have a waterfall of these IG guys falling in all of a sudden, on the back of a deep, dark recession. It’s healthy, but it’s also a little scary for high-yield.”                 ",

The U.S. is an outlier among peer nations in that it holds elections during the work week, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.  While trading floors in other countries sit empty during election days, the United States takes a different approach. On Tuesday, Americans headed to the polls to cast ballots for a variety of elections, including one for president of the United States. All the while, markets and other businesses generally remain open. This makes the United States an outlier among other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes many industrialized democracies such as Australia, Germany and Japan. About 75% of OECD members hold elections on the weekend when markets are closed, according to a 2018 analysis by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Other nations, like South Korea, open polls during the week, but make elections a national holiday, the analysis found. Various efforts to move U.S. elections to the weekends or make Election Day a federal holiday have so far come up short. But proponents aren't giving up: U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo introduced a bill in February that would turn Election Day into a federal holiday. She and other supporters argue opening polls when many people are off work would bolster turnout. Meanwhile, analysts are digesting corporate earnings calls rife with references to the elections, according to an analysis from FactSet, an analytics company. More than 36% of corporate conference calls held from mid-September through October mentioned the elections, making references more prolific now than during the last presidential election, FactSet said.

Today, the company has unveiled the creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) designed to expand EV charging infrastructure in the U.K. and beyond. The SPV aims to raise an initial £100 million ($130.10 million), offering investors the chance to capitalize on the rapidly growing EV infrastructure market. To kick off the project, Blink has partnered with Axxeltrova Capital, a private equity firm focused on digital infrastructure, renewable energy, and sustainable investments. This makes it the SPV’s first funding partner. “While we are in the early stages and agreements are still being formalized, the potential for growth in the EV sector is unmistakable,” said Mike Battaglia, CEO-Elect of Blink Charging. “We invite other investors to join us in this exciting opportunity to shape the future of electric mobility.” Also Read: Thomson Reuters Q3 Earnings: Legal, Corporate Segments Enjoy Revenue Boost As CEO Highlights AI Investment The SPV’s structure is designed to attract further investments, enabling Blink to deploy significant capital to expand accessible charging networks. The SPV targets projects eligible for subsidies through the UK’s Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) funding. Recently, the firm disclosed that it has received a nearly $2 million grant from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. This funding will enable Blink to own and operate EV chargers in the state of Illinois, facilitating public charging solutions for employees, residents, and visitors. Under this grant, the Illinois EPA will cover part of the eligible expenses for new commercial-grade DC Fast Chargers and Alternating Current Level 2 charging stations to be installed at publicly accessible locations throughout Illinois. Once completed, the project will feature 15 new Blink charging stations across five sites in Illinois, including 10 DC fast chargers with 180kW capacity and five Dual Port Level 2 stations (10 ports total). Blink is contributing a 30% cost share to the program. Price Action: BLNK shares are up 2.99% at $2.07 at the last check Tuesday.

The president of the Nasdaq stock market index said the Street is now pricing in the unexpected, and trading safety nets are also being tightened to reduce volatility as much as possible. It comes after oscillating reports of which nominee may ultimately win the Oval Office—with both candidates charting as ahead at some point in the election cycle. While former President Donald Trump has appeared to be marginally ahead for the last few weeks, in the past 48 hours alone, that story has once again changed, prompting a ripple effect through the financial markets. As a result, analysts are pricing in that uncertainty over the next couple of days, said Tal Cohen, president of the Nasdaq. \"When we think about the 2016 election and the 2020 election—even Brexit…[which] I think was a surprise to the markets in terms of the betting markets and the prediction markets—in this election, I think what you're seeing is the markets are pricing in a lot of uncertainty,\" Cohen told CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on Tuesday. \"That is very important to understand as you think about volatility rolling through the markets, is what kind of uncertainty is priced into the markets?\" he continued. Cohen added that clients on both the buy and sell sides have told the Nasdaq they are being \"very prudent about how they manage risk across the market over the next couple of days.\" The Nasdaq president also said he was in particular contact with regulators and was paying \"very close attention\" to the system's limit and credit checks. \"Those are the things that we'll do that we normally might not do on any other given week, but I think the Street understands to expect the unexpected this time around,\" Cohen added. Accounting for uncertainty for a matter of days might prove to be somewhat optimistic—elections since the turn of the millennium have dragged on for weeks before a final result was announced. Markets fell by nearly 8% in 2000 from election night to year-end, after the Bush-Gore battle took more than a month to resolve. And after the chaos Washington descended into following the 2020 election, analysts might be prudent to assume Trump wouldn't take another loss without an intense battle. Cohen confirmed he and his clients were ready for a prolonged period of uncertainty if necessary, saying: \"If it becomes a risk-off environment, or a risk-on environment, we'll know pretty quickly in the markets.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The peso, often seen as the currency most vulnerable to Trump’s trade policies, fell the most in three months, helping to send the emerging-market currency gauge toward its worst day since February 2023. China’s stock indexes in Hong Kong slid more than 2.5% as traders rushed to price in punitive tariffs and deeper growth challenges for the world’s second-biggest economy. Emerging markets were hit hard early Wednesday by the so-called Trump trade as they stand to lose from his “America first” economic priorities, including restrictions on imports and immigration. It was Trump’s trade war against China in 2018, during his first term, that halted an EM equity rally and sparked an underperformance relative to the US that continues to this day. This time around, there’s an added threat: Trump’s campaign pledges have pointed to an expansive fiscal policy, seen as inflationary, which would also undermine developing nations’ capacity to cut borrowing costs. “A Trump presidency will implement harsher and broader tariffs than during the last Trump administration,” with China targeted more than other countries, said Rajeev De Mello, chief investment officer at Gama Asset Management. “An expansionary fiscal policy will lead to higher bond yields, especially for bonds with longer maturities, resulting in a double whammy for the emerging markets through a stronger US dollar and higher US yields.” The Mexican peso (MXN/USD) fell as much as 3.3% to 20.8072 per dollar, its biggest slide since Aug. 5. Traders had been preparing for a Trump victory in recent weeks and volatility in the peso soared. Trump’s proposals would hit Mexico — the largest trade partner with the US — particularly hard. On the campaign trail, Trump said automakers building plants in Mexico are a “serious threat” to the US. The currency selloff was widespread as Trump appeared set to cruise to victory. Eastern European currencies posted some of the biggest losses on concern that Europe’s growth and monetary policy may be constrained, while the continent’s defense expenditure may go up. Trump has repeatedly stated that he would quickly end the war between Russia and Ukraine if reelected, and force Europe to take on more of the cost of paying for that conflict.            ",

Overnight implied volatility options for euro/dollar spiked to the highest level since November 2016, as did those for the dollar-Mexican peso pair, in recognition that the latter could be hard hit by protectionist policies if Republican Donald Trump defeats Democrat Kamala Harris. The VIX index of U.S. stock volatility, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hovered at 20.5, down 7% from Monday but up from 15 in September. That said, it remains at half the level experienced in the 2020 presidential election in a sign that markets remained relatively sanguine. \"I'm hopeful that we'll see clues pretty early. I believe polls close in Georgia and North Carolina at 7:30 p.m. (ET/0030 GMT on Wednesday), and both are states that count quickly,\" Christy Setzer, a Democrat strategist, said in the Reuters Global Markets Forum. \"So much of their states' votes are already in, so there's a smaller amount of Election Day voting.\" MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe climbed 1.1%. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index rose 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.4%. [.N] \"The polls remain neck and neck even as some recent polling has suggested that Harris has gained the upper hand,\" analysts at TD Securities said. \"Prediction markets have swung wildly on the updated polling, but a Red Wave (favoring Republicans) remains the most likely outcome priced into markets followed by Democratic President and split Congress.\" The 10-year Treasury yield pared earlier gains and slipped to 4.2888%, retreating from a four-month-high struck last week. [US/] Yields spiked higher earlier even as investors widely expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points when policymakers meet this week. The jump in yields followed data from the Institute for Supply Management that showed U.S. services sector activity unexpectedly accelerated in October to a more-than-two-year high, as employment strengthened. The two-year Treasury yield added 2 bps to 4.1972%, also near a three-month-high hit last week. \"Investors are braced for turbulence in the Treasury market, even allowing for the big moves that we've already seen in it recently,\" said John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics.

The peso dropped as low as 20.8038 per dollar for the first time since August 2022, more than 3% weaker than its previous close - the biggest such tumble since Mexico's election in summer roiled domestic assets. While emerging market currencies suffered broadly against a soaring dollar, the peso chalked up some of the biggest losses. \"The Mexican peso has been hit hard,\" said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING. \"High volatility is also undermining the carry trade and it’s hard to rule out a move to 22.00 over coming weeks.\" After Trump's 2016 presidential victory, the peso plummeted around 8.5% on the dollar to a then-historic low. The U.S. currency's climb began after very early indications of a Republican win in Georgia and continued to gathered pace, with the dollar index hitting a four-month peak. Markets had been fretting that the United States' southern neighbour could face trade barriers under a possible Trump presidency. Turner said 2025 could be a \"rough year for the peso\" if presumed president Trump would question the renewal of the USMCA at its review in 2026. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is the trade pact that took effect in 2020. Immigration, as well as remittances, from Mexico to the U.S. are expected to be other flash points.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround The ratio of put options to call options traded on the Cboe Volatility index was the highest level since 2020 on Monday, Barclays Plc strategists flagged in a note. More than one million put contracts changed hands on Monday alone, some outright and many as part of spreads, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “While polls in swing states still remain tightly contested, one outcome most investors agree with is that uncertainty will likely decline post-elections,” Barclays strategists including Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta wrote in the note. The VIX — which measures expected swings in the S&P 500 a month out — has been unusually high relative to actual market swings, as traders paid an extra premium for protection with the US election tightly contested and highly contentious. Buying the puts would be a bet that the surge in that implied volatility will fade back to more normal levels. Meanwhile, comparing pricing to recent prior elections shows that the absolute level of the VIX is around the middle of the range, compared to five recent presidential contests, according to data compiled by Bloomberg for the day prior to each vote. Monday’s closing level of about 22 was above 2004, 2012 and 2016, but below the Global Financial Crisis year of 2008 and the Covid-19 period of 2020. Looking ahead, a number of factors are seen as potentially supporting a late-year stock rally — including a drop in volatility. “The removal of the uncertainty will bring a reset in volatility that may see increased allocation from volatility control funds and the potential for a flattening of the index skew,” Tanvir Sandhu, Bloomberg Intelligence’s chief derivatives strategist, said in a note.

Palantir Technologies shares skyrocketed as strong AI demand helped the analytics software firm top quarterly estimates. Shares of Celanese plunged after the industrial chemical manufacturer missed third-quarter expectations, cut its dividend, and scaled back production plans.  Despite uncertainty over the next occupant of the White House and the economic policies that may ensue, major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher as voters headed to the polls on Election Day. However, investors are likely bracing for market volatility if the outcome remains undetermined over the coming days. The S&P 500 jumped 1.2% on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 1.4%, while the Dow added 1.0%. The top performance in the S&P 500 on Election Day belonged to analytics software provider Palantir Technologies (PLTR), whose shares skyrocketed 23.4%. The surge in the stock came after Palantir reported better-than-expected revenue and net income for the third quarter. Palantir's CEO highlighted \"unrelenting AI demand\" as a key driver of the company's strong performance. Engine manufacturer Cummins (CMI) also reported third-quarter sales and profits that exceeded analysts' forecasts, and its shares popped 9.0% higher. Although sales were essentially flat year-over-year, Cummins increased its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), reflecting margin expansion. Emerson Electric (EMR) shares surged 7.2% after the industrial technology and engineering company topped quarterly sales and profit estimates, boosted by growth in its Intelligent Devices segment. The firm also announced plans to acquire the remaining stake in Aspen Technology (AZPN), an automation software provider already under Emerson's partial control, in an effort to enhance its position in the industrial automation market. Shares of Celanese (CE) plummeted 26.3%, the steepest drop of any S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, after the chemical supplier's third-quarter sales and profits fell short of expectations. Softness in key end markets, including paints, coatings, and construction, weighed on the company's performance, along with declines in the automotive and industrial sectors in the Western Hemisphere. Celanese also cut its dividend and announced plans to scale back production, suggesting it expects headwinds to persist. Casino operator Wynn Resorts (WYNN) also reported weaker-than-expected top- and bottom-line results for the third quarter, and its shares dropped 9.3%. A slowdown in Wynn's Las Vegas operations contributed to the shortfall, while the company's results in Macau were mixed. Wynn also noted an investment of $18.2 million during the quarter in its joint venture that is under construction in the United Arab Emirates. Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) shares fell 6.0% after the agricultural commodities maker canceled its scheduled earnings conference call and announced that it would restate previous financial results. The company said that, along with previously disclosed issues that led to a prior restatement, it has discovered additional accounting inaccuracies affecting several segments, noting that it is working to complete the restatements as soon as possible. ADM also provided preliminary third-quarter results that came in below forecasts. ",

Global government spending on Palantir’s products, primarily from the US, rose 40% from the prior year to $408 million in the third quarter, accounting for 56% of the company’s total revenue for the period. This was ahead of the $379 million expected for the segment, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Palantir, which makes a range of data mining and analysis software, including its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), most recently won a $100 million US military contract in September for its AI tools that identify targets for air strikes. “The AI revolution is underway now,” Palantir’s chief revenue and legal officer Ryan Taylor said on a call with investors late Monday. “The chasm between the AI haves and have-nots is rapidly widening and the whole world is watching.” Taylor said Palantir’s US government business saw its “strongest sequential growth in 15 quarters driven largely by our [Department of Defense] business's 21% quarter-over-quarter growth.” Meanwhile, Palantir's revenue from commercial enterprises fell short of expectations, hitting $317 million versus the $330 million expected. Its enterprise customers include oil and gas giant BP (BP), CBS Broadcasting, and General Mills (GIS). The company said sales were impacted by \"a step down in revenue from a government-sponsored enterprise in the Middle East.\" Palantir did not respond to a request for further details from Yahoo Finance. Overall, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter, a penny ahead of expectations, on revenue of $725.5 million, which topped the $703.7 million expected by Wall Street analysts. Palantir shares have rallied more than 190% since the beginning of the year, fueled by a broader boom in artificial intelligence and the US government’s growing interest in AI war technologies. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in September. \"Palantir is among a handful of infrastructure software companies that have started to meaningfully monetize generative AI,\" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick in a note to investors Monday. While recognizing Palantir's advantages, Wall Street analysts overall have been skeptical of the stock’s surge. On average, they see shares falling to $32.81 over the next year, according to Bloomberg data, with roughly half of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommending selling the stock. Zelnick himself has a Sell rating on the stock and sees shares falling to $26. Shares stood at $51.15 at market close Tuesday.           ",

Now imagine the plight of money managers across the ever-competitive investment industry, who are struggling to assert ownership of their original ETF offerings as rival firms launch imitator products with strikingly similar tickers. Most Read from Bloomberg From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers In Warsaw, Falling Road Deaths Signal a Traffic Safety Turnaround That’s what happened to VanEck. The asset manager is an early pioneer of tying a fund’s investment theme with its ticker name – a now make-or-break practice for issuers keen to ensure their strategies stick in the minds of investors. After it launched an agriculture-focused fund in the US in 2007 with the ticker MOO, executives at the firm were left reeling after hearing that a similar product was making its debut in the European market some while later. The ticker for the wannabe fund? MOOO. As competition becomes more cutthroat, investment firms across both sides of the Atlantic have been launching funds with the same tickers as their competitors in another jurisdiction. It doesn’t stop there: often these copycat funds have comparable allocation strategies, from niche commodity trades to high-octane technology investments. That’s because all of the biggest and best ideas have already been taken, said Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar. “It’s fair play at the end of the day,” he said. “If your competitors aren’t represented in a particular market with that same underlying benchmark or concept, then it’s finders keepers.” In some instances, the copycat ETFs have pulled off the seemingly improbable feat of netting more inflows than the original offerings, underscoring how first-mover advantage is no guarantee of success in an industry where marketing and fund distribution can seal the fate for firms of all stripes. In the case of MOO, the original fund saw its assets skyrocket to above $2.5 billion just three years after its inception. So another company putting out a similar product “crossed the line” and had the potential to confuse investors, said a person familiar with VanEck’s perspective. Yet there was little the firm could do about it — it didn’t own the ticker, the exchange the fund was listing on did — and the European MOOO ended up launching in what became an early example of the copycat trend. Since then, the trend has only picked up. An informal analysis by Bloomberg found that there are currently at least 59 pairs of impersonators — or funds that share similar characteristics and the exact same four-letter ticker base — cross-listed in Europe and the US by different issuers.

        "body": "Ferrari (RACE) stock slipped on Tuesday after the Italian luxury automaker reported third quarter results that were in line with expectations but deliveries that slumped compared to a year ago. Ferrari does expect strengthening sales in Q4 to boost full-year results. For the quarter, Maranello-based Ferrari reported revenue of €1.64 billion ($1.79 billion), matching estimates as compiled by Bloomberg and up 7% versus a year ago. Adjusted EPS for Q3 came in at €2.08 ($2.27), also matching estimates, and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) was €638 million ($695 million), up 7% and slightly ahead of Street estimates. Despite growth in revenue and profit, deliveries in the quarter dropped 2% versus a year ago to 3,383 units. While most regions saw slight sales growth (led by the Americas at 4%), China shipments tumbled 22%. Ferrari stock trading on the NYSE closed down 7.36% on Tuesday. Even with its somewhat lackluster Q3 results and a drop in deliveries, Ferrari reaffirmed its full-year guidance. Ferrari still sees revenue for the year climbing to €6.55 billion ($7.14 billion) with adjusted EBITDA of €2.50 billion ($2.73 billion), as the automaker sees demand in other regions, and its product portfolio, driving results. “The third quarter once again shows growing results for Ferrari, driven by a strong product mix and increased personalization,\" said Benedetto Vigna, CEO of Ferrari. \"It confirms our commitment to deliver on the promises we made at our Capital Markets Day in 2022, along with the exceptional order book visibility well into 2026. The Ferrari Purosangue SUV, the Roma Spider convertible, and the 296 GTS sports car drove deliveries in the quarter, Ferrari said. The company noted SF90 XX Stradale supercar deliveries also rose in the quarter, with the sister SF90 XX Spider beginning deliveries. For Ferrari’s even higher-end cars, customer allocations for the ultra-exclusive Daytona SP3 (MSRP $2.23 million) rose versus the prior year, as expected. The company also debuted its latest hypercar last month, the F80, with all 799 already spoken for despite a price of €3.6 million, or $3.9 million. Ferrari follows a string of other European automakers like Mercedes, Porsche, and others experiencing sales slumps, especially in Asia, as luxury demand softens in some parts of the world. Porsche saw 25% of sales stemming from China a year ago (60,747 units) through Q3; those sales fell 29% in the same period this year, down to 43,280 units. Luckily for Ferrari, China only accounts for 8.3% of all shipments, whereas a year ago Mercedes had a whopping 37% from the region.          ",

        "body": "Donald Trump’s meme stock racked up double-digit gains on the final day before the election, dismissing a shock weekend poll predicting a groundswell of support among women for opponent Kamala Harris. Shares in Trump Media and Technology Group, whose multibillion-dollar valuation often reflects the odds of the ex-President returning to the White House, jumped 12% during Monday’s trading session, closing at $34.34 each. Its price has more than doubled over the past 30-odd days amid growing market confidence in an impending Trump victory this week. However, the latest gains didn’t seem to lift his spirits. Potentially worrying data published this weekend by resident Des Moines Register pollster Ann Selzer suggests female voters may be flocking to Harris in large numbers even in the nation’s rural heartlands home to Trump’s conservative base. “I got a poll I’m 10 points up in Iowa, one of my enemies just puts out a poll, I’m three down,” he told a rally. “Why do they announce a poll that’s highly skewed towards Democrats and liberals?” Using words like “enemy” to describe a respected opinion pollster like Selzer is symptomatic of the incendiary and often dehumanizing rhetoric that Trump has long been known for. Refuting Trump’s claim, Selzer told CNN her polling methodology has not changed one bit since the time her surveys in 2016 and 2020 pointed to Trump leading in the state. “We did nothing to make that happen. I’m a big believer in keeping my dirty fingers off the data,” she said on Monday, adding there was \"no upside\" to manipulating her poll data to give an advantage to Harris. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zguy5q1lfXc In the dying days of the race, Trump’s campaign may have suffered an unforced error following a mass rally at Madison Square Garden that alienated Puerto Ricans and Hispanics more generally following offensive remarks by a comedian invited to address the crowd. Trump, who quickly disavowed the individual, sought to compensate for controversy by taking the stage in Pittsburgh on Monday with the son of Puerto Rican baseball legend Roberto Clemente, in the city where his late father once played for the Pirates. The former president also received a late yet important boost from comedian Joe Rogan, the world’s best-paid podcaster. Rogan waited until the eve of the election to officially endorse Trump. Nonetheless, it’s clear Selzer’s poll for the Des Moines Register represents some cause for concern that females—who turn out to vote more frequently than their male counterparts—may quietly be abandoning Trump.

Along with Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and the cryptocurrency industry, prediction markets are a clear winner of the U.S. election. The GOP's surprisingly strong showing Tuesday night came as a shock to those who only got their information from mainstream media, pollsters and pundits. To those who'd been watching the odds on Polymarket, Kalshi, PredictIt and similar betting sites over the course of the year, the results were long within the realm of possibility. \"The markets were far and away the best forecast of the 2024 election,\" said Koleman Strumpf, a professor of economics at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. \"While pollsters said 'too close to call' (or [Democratic nominee Kamala] Harris is favored), markets identified Trump as the favorite.\" The vindication comes after several weeks in which the mainstream media harped on the theory that Polymarket, which runs on crypto rails and has seen billions of dollars in trading volume this year, was being manipulated by pro-Trump forces to inflate his odds. \"None of the hysterical claims about how markets would damage democracy or other woes came to pass,\" Strumpf said. Although the Associated Press (traditionally the gold standard) had not called the race in the wee small hours of the morning Wednesday, Polymarket was giving Republican candidate Donald Trump a 98.8% chance of re-taking the White House, up from about 60% 24 hours earlier. For most of the late summer and fall, polls were giving the edge – albeit small and sometimes within the margin of error – to Democrats. But by 1:25 a.m. ET Wednesday, even the New York Times, hardly in the tank for Trump, was giving him a greater than 95% chance of victory. The newspaper's online \"needle\" was forecasting he would win 306 electoral votes – well more than the 270 needed to win. None of this is to say that polls and other forecasting methods still don't have their place, as even proponents of prediction markets were quick to point out. \"The lesson is that markets are great and forecasts are an input to those markets,\" said Haseeb Qureshi, a managing partner at Dragonfly (and investor in Polymarket). \"Both are valuable, and in this case they didn't disagree by much. But markets were probably adding in some alpha into the raw forecasts that was missing.\" Aaron Brogan, a lawyer who has studied prediction markets, cautioned against making sweeping conclusions from the fresh data.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers The offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3% against the dollar, the largest one-day drop since October 2022. Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong bore the brunt of the selling, with a Hang Seng gauge closing 2.6% lower, while stocks on the mainland registered smaller declines amid hopes for more stimulus. Traders now have to grapple with the specter of Washington slapping tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods, a move that can further weaken the world’s second-largest economy and disrupt global supply chains. While some have said a second Trump presidency will weigh less on Chinese markets given investors have become accustomed to his hawkish rhetoric, policy uncertainties and rising tensions may still fuel market swings. “The volatility of the yuan will pick up in the short term as a knee-jerk reaction to Trump’s victory,” said Cary Yeung, head of Greater China debt at Pictet Asset Management. The longer-term price action depends on tariffs implementation, US rate cut trajectory and the magnitude of China’s policy response to stabilize the economy, he said. The onshore yuan extended declines to 0.9% as Trump’s lead widened in the afternoon. Traders are now turning their attention to Beijing’s policy firepower. With Chinese exports proving to be a rare bright spot amid a sluggish economy, a hostile trade environment means authorities will need to ramp up both monetary and fiscal support to offset the negative impact. The central bank chief has pledged to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance and double down on countercyclical adjustments. There’s also the expectation of further fiscal stimulus from the Standing Committee meeting of the National People’s Congress, which concludes on Friday.

The CSI 300 Index surged nearly 35% from a September low through Oct. 8, but has fallen about 5% since. The benchmark for onshore shares slipped 0.5% on Wednesday. While Beijing may offer support if markets go south, there are concerns over how a second Trump presidency, and his anti-China policies, may sour US investors’ appetite toward the Asian nation.

Wall Street expects the San Diego, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $2.56 per share, up from $2.02 per share in the year-ago period. The company projects to report revenue of $9.9 billion, compared to $8.66 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. On Tuesday, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained Qualcomm with an Overweight and lowered the price target from $210 to $195. With the recent buzz around Qualcomm ahead of quarterly earnings, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends, too. Qualcomm currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.05%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 85 cents per share ($3.40 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Qualcomm, we start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Qualcomm's $3.40 dividend: $6,000 / $3.40 = 1,765 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $292,831 worth of Qualcomm, or 1,765 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $3.40 = 353 shares, or $58,566 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. View more earnings on QCOM Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. Price Action: Shares of Qualcomm gained by 0.4% to close at $165.91 on Tuesday.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow BMW, which reported disappointed quarterly earnings earlier Wednesday, fell as much as 7.5% in Frankfurt. Porsche, the maker of 911 sports cars, dropped to its lowest intraday value since the stock started trading more than two years ago. Shares of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Volkswagen AG also declined. Additional tariffs would hurt Germany’s automakers, which send more vehicles to the US than to any other country. The market is increasingly lucrative for them because of robust demand for large sport utility vehicles and a slower shift to EVs than in Europe, allowing them to sell more of their higher-margin combustion-engine models. Trump’s election victory “marks the beginning of the most difficult economic moment” in Germany’s post-war history, said Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. “The country now faces massive foreign trade and security policy challenges for which we are not prepared.” Mercedes declined as much as 6.55%. Volkswagen, which owns brands including Audi, Lamborghini and Bentley, fell as much as 5.5%. During his campaign, Trump had said he plans to slap duties on foreign-made cars shipped to the US to protect local jobs. A trade conflict with Washington would create yet another problem for the German manufacturers, which are already facing tough competition in China and muted demand in Europe. “I want German car companies to become American car companies,” Trump said during a speech in Savannah, Georgia in September. “I want them to build their plants here.” Most of them already have. German automakers operate several factories in the US where they produce cars both for local buyers and for export — meaning any European countermeasures could increase the fallout from a trade spat. Volkswagen assembled around 175,000 cars at its plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee last year, including the Atlas and electric ID.4 models. The company says it has invested more than $4.3 billion in the site since 2009. Mercedes manufactures top-end SUVs at its plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. While BMW is struggling with a costly recall that contributed to its lowest quarterly profitability in more than four years, the company may be best shielded from the fallout as most of the cars it sells in the US are built locally. Its largest plant is in Spartanburg, South Carolina — a factory it opened in 1994 where it makes its popular X-series of larger SUVs. It’s prepared to produce more in the US if needed, Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse said Wednesday during a call with reporters.            ",

The 10-year Treasury yield rose 18 basis points, and the 30-year bond yield saw its biggest jump since March 2020. Trump's policies could increase inflation, impacting the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategy. Bond yields are soaring after Donald Trump's reelection, suggesting that US borrowers might not get the relief they've been hoping for as Trump's policies have the potential to complicate the Federal Reserve's interest rate plans. The 10-year US Treasury yield surged 18 basis points on Wednesday morning to 4.477%, representing the highest level since July 1. It's surged 76 basis points since the Fed launched its first interest rate cut of the cycle in mid-September. Longer-term yields also spiked, with the 30-year US Treasury yield jumping as much as 24 basis points for its biggest move higher since March 2020. Treasury yields influence the pricing of consumer and corporate debt, and the latest moves higher will put pressure on consumer borrowers who want to take out a mortgage to buy a house or an auto loan to buy a car. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate — which closely tracks the 10-year Treasury yield — has been creeping up toward 7% and is likely to eclipse that level if Wednesday's yield surge holds. That would send mortgage rates back to the levels they were at this summer, dimming hopes for potential home buyers to see some improvement in affordability. The surge in bond yields is being driven by the expectation that Trump's policy proposals, like broad tariffs, tax cuts, and the deportation of millions of immigrants, would be inflationary, driving up prices and wage growth. That would cause the Fed to change its road map for further interest rate cuts as prices and wage growth once again creep up. \"The Federal Reserve may take the view that if fiscal policy is going to be loosened relative to their previous baseline forecast then it needs to run monetary policy tighter, implying a higher neutral interest rate to keep inflation at its 2% target,\" James Knightley, an economist at ING Economics, said. While markets expect the Fed to proceed with a 25 basis point interest rate cut at its meeting on Thursday, the chances of another 25 basis point rate cut in December dropped to 66% on Wednesday from 77% on Tuesday, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool. Economist Derek Tang of LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics said the Fed could already be recalibrating monetary policy to adapt to the expectations of a second Trump term.      ",

PBI asks them After a bruising and divisive election campaign, Donald Trump has triumphed. RBI sounds out banking industry experts on the implications for the financial services sector. While the US presidential election outcome isn’t confirmed yet, Donald Trump is in the lead at the time of writing. With three swing states – Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia – already called for Trump by the US media, he’s also slightly in the lead in the remaining four key states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the Presidency. At the time of writing, Trump stands at 267, Kamala Harris at 224. In addition to the Presidency, American voters cast their ballots on the full House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate. Preliminary results suggest a close contest in the House, but the Republicans are currently leading and are on track to secure a majority. As expected, Senate control looks poised to shift from Democrats to Republicans. If this ‘Red sweep’ were to happen, it would enable Trump to implement more of his programme – including fiscal measures such as tax cuts and tariff increases on emerging markets (and potentially Europe). In the coming weeks, we could see some volatility. However, it’s also possible that clarity on the US elections reduces uncertainty for some time. It’s worth noting that between 1936-2023, the S&P 500 delivered an average performance of 15-16% in periods when the US had a split Congress, compared to 12% when there was a united Government. Perhaps this is because of the volatility created by a unified government being able to deliver more significant policy changes. Obviously, we’d need to see the final results. Based on US laws, the next important date is 11 December, when all vote reporting, counting (and recounting) stops. Six days later, all 538 members of the Electoral College will meet, with at least 270 votes needed to elect the next US President. The result of the election is then sent to the new US Congress, which will convene for the first time on 3 January 2025 and officially validate the Electoral College on 6 January. Finally, on 20 January, the 47th US Presidential inauguration starts. A continuation of the ‘Trump-Trade’\n\nAs we write, financial markets continue to react to the news. Asian stocks are softening, while the S&P 500 futures (financial instruments that could anticipate the equity market reaction once the US opens) gained and are now close to their all-time high. We have a slight tactical equity overweight, which we combine with a preference for short-dated government bonds and high-quality corporate bonds, while we’re typically underweight risky bonds.

        "body": "President John Kennedy famously said that a rising tide lifts all boats, and that is looking to be the case in today’s bullish stock market environment. The big question for investors now is, where to buy in, to ride that rising tide? The stock analysts at Bank of America may have some suggestions. They’ve been scouring the market – looking for lesser-known names that offer solid potential for gains. On two of these stocks, the analysts have upgraded their stance – a clear sign for investors that these shares deserve a closer look. The Bank of America choices come from widely different areas of the stock market, making them a clear example for investors that the current bullish turn is broad-based. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve delved into what makes these stocks stand out. Here’s a closer look at the details. KE Holdings (BEKE) We’ll start in China, with KE Holdings. This company, as its name states, is a holding company; it works in China’s real estate sector, in which it is the largest online real estate transaction platform. The company facilitates both online and offline transactions and services in the Chinese real estate sector. Even with the recent headwinds it has been facing (a slowing economy, developer bankruptcies, accusations of shoddy construction), Chinese real estate remains a huge market. KE Holdings has leveraged that into a big business, generating some US$11 billion in revenues in 2023 and building up a market cap of more than $27 billion. Starting in mid-September, KE Holdings has seen its stock price climb – at the same time that the Chinese government has started pushing a set of stimulative policies. The government has lowered the reserve requirement ratio that the banks must meet, as well as loosening purchase restrictions in the real estate sector. The immediate result was to make it easier for buyers to access capital, which has stimulated purchasing activity in the real estate markets. For KE, the result has been clear. The stock hit a recent bottom in mid-September, and although share performance in October has seen both ups and downs it remains elevated from its recent low – with a net gain of more than 65%. We’ll soon find out how KE Holdings performed during the third quarter of this year, but we can look back at the 2Q24 numbers for an idea of where the company is headed. Revenues in Q2 came to US$3.2 billion, up almost 20% year-over-year and $120 million over the estimates, while the bottom-line figure, of 31 cents EPADS by non-GAAP measures, was 10 cents per share better than had been forecast. The company registered a gross transaction value during the quarter of US$115.5 billion, an increase of 7.5% from the prior-year period.                  ",

These companies reported a total market capitalisation increase of 2%, from $4.2trn on 30 June 2024 to $4.3trn on 30 September 2024, reveals GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) witnessed the largest growth in market capitalisation of 24.6% to $105bn in Q3 2024, fuelled by robust pipeline progress and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its antipsychotic drug Cobenfy for the treatment of schizophrenia in September 2024. Cobenfy is forecast to achieve drug analyst consensus global sales of $2.4bn by 2030, according to GlobalData’s drugs database. Furthermore, Bristol Myers Squibb signed a $3.5bn licensing agreement with Prime Medicine to develop ex vivo T-cell therapies using Prime’s gene-editing reagents based on its PASSIGE technology, bolstering its cell and gene-therapy pipeline. Gilead Sciences’ market capitalisation growth of 22.1% was driven by the FDA accelerated approval of its peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor oral agonist Livdelzi for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, along with the approval of its antibody-drug conjugate Trodelvy in Japan for the treatment of hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- breast cancer. These approvals strengthen its liver diseases portfolio, which includes Vemlidy for hepatitis B, Epclusa for hepatitis C, and Hepcludex for hepatitis D, as well as expand Gilead Sciences’ oncology presence in Japan. Sanofi reported a 19.2% increase in market capitalisation due to the strong performance of its blockbuster drug Dupixent in Q2 2024 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic oesophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. Dupixent’s European Medicines Agency and FDA approvals for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, received in July and September 2024, respectively, further fuelled Sanofi’s market capitalisation growth. AbbVie and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals witnessed comparable market capitalisation growth, with AbbVie reporting 15.2% and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals 14.9% over Q3 2024. AbbVie’s growth was driven by the success of its immunology blockbuster drugs - Humira, Skyrizi, and Rinvoq - with reported sales of $2.8bn, $2.7bn, and $1.4bn, respectively, in Q2 this year. Meanwhile, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals’ growth was primarily due to its RNA interference drug vutrisiran having met its primary endpoint of reduced all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events in the Phase III HELIOS-B trial for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, positioning the company in the top 20 global biopharmaceutical companies by market capitalisation in Q3 2024.

        "body": "The pound dropped at its sharpest pace against the dollar in nearly two years and stocks have jumped after Donald Trump said he had won a “magnificent victory for the American people” in the US presidential election. Sterling slumped as much as 1.4pc against the dollar to $1.285, its lowest level in two months, as traders scrambled to take advantage of so-called “Trump trades” in the wake of the US presidential election. The dollar was up as much as 2pc against the euro, which was worth $1.08, and jumped 1.8pc versus the yen. Investors are betting on a strong dollar as Mr Trump heads for the White House, reasoning that his pledge to introduce harsh tariffs and spend freely will drive inflation and keep US interest rates high. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar index surged at its fastest pace since 2020. Stocks also jumped in the wake of the vote. The FTSE 100 leapt 1.3pc in London, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 jumped 1.8pc after the Republican candidate took the crucial swing states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Georgia ahead of Democrat candidate Kamala Harris. The biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 were US-facing stocks, with Ashtead leading the index’s risers. The international building equipment rental company, which has strong operations in the US, was up 6.8pc. InterContinental Hotels climbed 5.7pc, while gambling giant Entain, which has expanded its American operations, rose 4.9pc. Markets in the US also rallied. Futures indicated the S&P 500 was on track to open more than 2pc higher in New York, while the Dow looked set to gain more than 2.6pc when trading began. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said markets were expressing “relief” that the US presidential election appeared to have delivered a decisive result. In the debt market, US government borrowing costs surged. Treasury yields shot to four-month highs. Yields on 10-year treasury bonds – the return the government promises to pay buyers of its debt – jumped to 4.47pc. Two-year yields climbed to 4.31pc from 4.19pc amid expectations that Mr Trump will enact more inflationary policies. Mark Haefele, of UBS, said the jump in yields was “in anticipation of higher nominal GDP growth and higher fiscal deficits”. Government borrowing costs fell in Europe as investors snapped up bonds, amid concerns that Mr Trump’s inflationary tariffs will hurt growth and force central banks to cut interest rates to boost economies. The yields on UK, German and French bonds were all lower. Bitcoin climbed as much as 8.5pc to reach a record high of $75,060 as the self-styled “Crypto President” said he would be “putting America first”.   ",

(NASDAQ:MBLY) have announced a strategic alliance aimed at accelerating the commercialization of autonomous vehicle (AV) services. Mobileye, a provider of self-driving technology and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), will deliver its AV technology to manufacturers of AV-ready vehicles, which will then be made available to fleet operators and transportation service providers. “Mobileye’s full-stack technology is an important part of getting autonomous fleets Lyft-ready,” said David Risher, CEO at Lyft. The partnership intends to leverage Lyft’s extensive network of 40 million annual riders to create a seamless demand platform for Mobileye Drive-equipped AV fleets. The collaboration will allow future AV fleet operators to purchase Lyft-ready vehicles from manufacturers and utilize Lyft’s platform to optimize fleet utilization and profitability in major North American cities.

According to Benzinga Pro, LYFT stock has gained over 35% in the past year. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Advisor Managed Portfolios Trenchless Fund ETF (NYSE:RVER) and Amplify ETF Trust Amplify Travel Tech ETF (NYSE:AWAY).

        "body": "What President-elect Donald Trump says he will do and what he actually does have not always been a straight line, but if he follows through on his declared intentions for the economy, it bodes well for American corporations and high-income individuals, at least in the short term. The same cannot be said for the millions of middle-income and even lower-income voters who returned him to the White House. And down the road, things could turn bumpy for the whole economy, with a return of higher inflation, labor shortages and slower trade and tourism driven by the new broad-based tariffs and mass deportations that Trump promised to pursue on the campaign trail. His general orientation is to pull back from globalization, which would probably have a bigger effect on more internationally dependent economies such as California's. A Trump presidency also will complicate the task of the Federal Reserve. If Trump's tax cut plans and other moves stimulate the economy and drive up consumer prices, the central bank could decide it needs to end its interest rate-cutting plans earlier and leave rates higher. The Fed is expected to announce a quarter-point rate cut Thursday — its second cut in recent months. For now, though, the expectation of good times for those at the top of the economic pyramid was immediately signaled by a leap upward in U.S. financial markets. In the afternoon after Trump’s decisive election victory, the Dow Jones industrial average had surged more than 1,500 points, or 3.6%, as investors priced in potential gains for a swath of industries and a near-term boost to economic growth. A second Trump presidential term is expected to bring significant policy changes favorable to big business, including lower corporate taxes and less regulation. Top regulators at agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission are likely to be replaced, easing the path for more mergers and acquisitions. “While Trump’s policy on tariffs and trade could bring volatility, the promise of deregulation and a more activist-friendly SEC might encourage dealmaking and shareholder activism in multiple sectors,” said Lucinda Guthrie, head of financial data company Mergermarket in New York. Some of Wednesday’s biggest stock winners were banks and oil and gas companies. Trump’s firm that runs his social media platform took off, as did bitcoin, thanks to his remarks that he would make the U.S. the dominant cryptocurrency market in the world. Tesla, the electric vehicle maker owned by Elon Musk, a big Trump backer, was also an early beneficiary. Its shares jumped by 14.8% even as other green energy stocks sank under the weight of Trump’s well-known bashing of climate change programs.                 ",

The reported quarterly sales of $708.66 million missed the consensus estimate of $717.66 million. Screening revenue was $545 million, an increase of 15%, and Precision Oncology’s revenue was $164 million, an increase of 5% on a reported and core revenue basis. Also Read: FDA Clears Exact Sciences’ Next-Generation Colorectal Cancer Diagnostic Test. “While we have made progress, our execution during the third quarter and updated outlook for the full year don’t reflect our full potential. We plan to accelerate growth in 2025, and our long-term outlook remains strong,” said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO. Guidance: Exact Sciences cuts its 2024 revenue guidance from $2.81 billion-$2.85 billion to $2.73 billion-$2.75 billion compared to the consensus of $2.832 billion. The guidance includes a Screening sales forecast of $2.08 billion—$2.095 billion, compared to previous guidance of $2.155 billion—$2.175 billion. Precision Oncology sales are expected to be $650 million- $655 million, down from prior guidance of $655 million – $675 million. The company expects 2024 Adjusted EBITDA of $310 million—$320 million, down from previous guidance of $335 million—$355 million. William Blair notes that management attributed the lower-than-expected guidance primarily to challenges affecting the screening segment. While these explanations are logical, they raise questions about why certain factors weren’t identified or addressed sooner. Management, however, took full responsibility and conveyed a sincere commitment to improving performance, the analyst writes. Despite these hurdles, the analyst remains optimistic about revenue growth in 2025, highlighting several factors within the company’s control. William Blair emphasizes that investors will likely want to see clear signs of improved execution and revenue growth resuming in 2025. With shares trading down, the analyst writes that valuation is at a compelling long-term entry point. Price Action: At last check on Wednesday, EXAS stock was down 28.50% at $51.16.

In Paris, the CAC 40 was nearly unchanged, at 7,368.10. Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.2% higher to 8,182.27. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.3% to 39,381.41, reflecting worries over the potential for a revival of trade tensions under a Trump administration. “I think everybody’s going to be worried about Trump's tariffs because that’s one of the things in his playbook. And so we’ll have to see how things develop in the early stages of his presidency this time,\" said Neil Newman, head of strategy for Astris Advisory Japan. South Korea's Kospi finished nearly flat, at 2,564.63. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 8,226.30. Chinese shares rallied after the government reported that exports jumped nearly 13% in October over a year earlier, the fastest pace in more than two years and far outpacing the 2.4% increase in September. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 2% to 20,953.34. The Shanghai Composite index was up 2.6% at 3,470.66. Trump has promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, raising them still more if Beijing makes a move to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan. Investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean. Higher tariffs on imports from China would add to the burdens Beijing is facing as it struggles to revive slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy. But the impact may be less drastic than feared, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report. “We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months –- any drag from potential Trump tariffs may not materialize until the second half of next year,\" Huang said. Still, higher tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other countries would raise the risk of trade wars and other disruptions to the global economy. Trump's win raised expectations that Beijing may ramp up its spending and other stimulus to counter such trends. The Standing Committee of China's legislature is meeting this week and is expected to announce further measures by Friday.            ",

The company unveiled a new extended range charging system for its EVs, known as Kunpeng Super Electric System, during its corporate AI Day on Wednesday in Guangzhou, its operational base in southern Guangdong province. Kunpeng will be the new benchmark in the industry capable of achieving more than 1,400km and a pure- electric range of 430km, Xpeng claimed, suggesting the carmaker will be producing hybrid models in the near future to complement its current all-electric line-up.

The firm plans to expand to around 60 countries by end-2025 and set up over 300 overseas sales and services centres, he added on Wednesday. Extended-range EVs (EREVs) are a type of plug-in hybrid car, equipped with a small internal combustion engine which generates additional power to charge the battery when needed. The hybrids can also be charged directly using a power cable. Xpeng will go up against Beijing-based Li Auto, which spearheaded the move into EREVs to overcome concerns about \"range anxiety\" among local consumers. All other Chinese EV makers, except Shanghai-based Nio, have also entered the fray as sales of hybrid models gained momentum. In mainland China, sales of plug-in hybrids almost doubled to 361,000 units in September while extended-range vehicles soared 89 per cent to 111,000 units, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Sales of pure EVs rose 29 per cent to 644,000 units. BYD, the world's largest assembler of hybrids and pure EVs, overtook Tesla in sales for the first time, when hybrids recorded the biggest growth in sales in the third quarter from a year earlier.

        "body": "U.S. stocks soared Wednesday as former President Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in one of the most contentious elections in U.S. history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped over 1,500 points Wednesday, continuing the climb seen in the pre-market session after the president-elect took the stage at his headquarters in Florida early Wednesday morning, thanking his supporters and promising to restore the country. \"We're going to pay you back. We are going to do the best job. We're going to turn it around. It's got to be turned around, and it's got to be turned around fast. And we're going to turn it around\" said Trump. Dow financials, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan help drive the gains. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also saw sizable gains of over 2%. All three of the major market averages are on pace for a record close. \"This is what lower regulation and lower taxes look like,\" said Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes during an appearance on 'Varney & Co.' Read On The Fox Business App Trump invited Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, the presumptive new vice president, to the podium to speak, and he addressed reviving the U.S. economy, a top election issue. \"We're going to lead the greatest economic comeback in American history under Donald Trump's leadership,\" Vance told the crowd. Fox News: Election 2024 Live Results Americans have been dealt a hand of sky-high inflation in recent years. While it has come down from its 9% peak, prices for everyday items such as food remain elevated. Even before Trump appeared to emerge as the winner, stock futures were steadily climbing, building on a rally Tuesday in which all three of the major market averages rose over 1% as all the major sectors in the S&P 500 locked in gains. \"What the outcome of an election does is to provide us some certain amount of falling uncertainty\" Ken Fisher, chairman and founder of Fisher Investments, said during an interview on \"Cavuto Coast to Coast\" ahead of the election outcome. Another layer of uncertainty will be lifted on Thursday, when the Federal Reserve makes a decision on interest rates. Market participants are predicting a 25 basis point cut and perhaps the same at the December meeting, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool, which measures the probability of rate moves. Markets climbed heading into the election, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite up over 20% annually, while the Dow is up 12%. Investors snapped up shares of industrial, financial and energy stocks within the S&P. Trump is pro-energy, touting his \"drill, baby, drill\" mantra throughout his campaign.          ",

In his victory speech before the election was officially called, he praised running mate JD Vance and Elon Musk’s support. Calling it “the greatest political movement,” Trump vowed to “fix everything about our country.” On Tuesday, November 5th, U.S. markets closed higher, led by broad gains across sectors, as economic data signaled resilience in the services sector. Investors remain wary, however, with volatility anticipated due to the tight presidential race between Trump and Harris, which will impact both bond and currency markets. In economic data, the September U.S. trade deficit expanded to $84.4 billion, marking its highest level since April 2022 and exceeding market expectations of $84.1 billion.

        "body": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Tuesday that it will be taking action against the online cash app and neobank Dave, which it says used \"misleading marketing to deceive consumers.\" At issue is how Dave marketed $500 cash advances to consumers that it rarely offered, and the \"Express Fee\" it charged if customers wanted their money immediately. The FTC claimed the service was misleading because Dave's marketing implied that its cash advances would be \"instant,\" using terminology like \"on the spot\" to describe them, without disclosing the fees involved until after the consumer completed the sign-up process and gave Dave access to their bank account. The fees ranged anywhere from $3 to $25, the complaint stated. If the user chose not to pay the fee, they'd have to wait two to three business days for the standard transfer to go through, the complaint says. What's more, the FTC says, Dave would also sometimes charge a surprise fee, which it described as a \"tip.\" The user interface was designed to make this difficult for users to detect or avoid the fee, leading to consumers feeling scammed, according to the FTC. This latter issue is another example of the \"dark patterns\" — or manipulative design practices — companies use to guide users to take actions benefiting their own goals, not the consumers. Examples of the type of behavior the FTC now wants to penalize are things like automatically checking boxes when users sign up, or showing larger buttons for the actions the company wants users to take. According to a recent study by the agency, a majority of subscription apps and websites use dark patterns to trick consumers. In Dave's case, consumers were shown images of a cartoon child surrounded by food and messaging like \"10 Healthy Meals,\" \"15 Healthy Meals,\" or \"20 Healthy Meals,\" implying that the tip would go to providing meals for people in need. However, the FTC says that only 10 cents of each \"tip\" is donated and the company keeps the remaining amount. In other words, the tip doesn't actually provide a full meal, much less 10 to 20 meals. Also, when consumers tried to lower their tip, they would see an image of the food being taken away from the child until they were left with an empty plate, the complaint says. According to SEC filings, Dave received more than $149 million in revenue from tips from 2022 through the first six months of 2024, the FTC said. Another issue was that Dave charges a $1 monthly membership fee debited directly from customers' bank accounts. But when users discovered the fee, they were not able to easily cancel it, according to the complaint. Some even tried to delete their account to escape the fee and were still charged, the FTC says.    ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The S&P 500 climbed 2.5% on bets the newly elected president will enact pro-growth policies that will boost Corporate America. The benchmark had its best post-Election Day in history, according to data compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc. and Bloomberg. A gauge of small caps rallied 5.8% amid speculation they will benefit from Trump’s protectionist stance, while wagers on lower taxes and reduced regulation lifted banks. Insurers focused on the Medicare market jumped on expectations the new government will pay higher rates to companies that provide private versions of the US health program for seniors. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — tumbled the most since August. Almost 19 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, 63% above the daily average in the past three months. The Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped to a fresh high after a three-year drought of records, finally confirming the strength of its industrial counterpart. The breakout is a bullish sign to followers of an investing framework known as Dow Theory that says synchronized gains in both gauges portend better times ahead for the broad market. “For now, investor sentiment is pro-growth, pro-deregulation, and pro-markets,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group. “There is also an assumption that M&A activity will pickup and that more tax cuts are coming or the existing ones will be extended. This creates a strong backdrop for stocks.” Treasury yields climbed across the curve, with the move led by longer-term bonds as traders slashed wagers on the scope of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Investors have doubled down on bets for policies such as tax cuts and tariffs that could trigger price pressures. The moves also signal worries that Trump’s proposals will fuel the budget deficit and spur higher bond supply. US 10-year yields advanced 17 basis points to 4.44%. A dollar gauge added 1.3%, with the yen leading losses in major currencies and the euro down 1.8%. The Mexican peso was almost flat after sinking as much as 3.5%. Bitcoin, viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade after he embraced digital assets during his campaign, hit a record high. Commodities came under pressure, with gold and copper tumbling.

Recommended Reading Campaign Trail: Taco Bell takes on ‘Big Chicken’ through family debates Yum Brands, the owner of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, is seeing increased marketing performance thanks to new bets on artificial intelligence (AI), executives said when discussing the company’s Q3 earnings results with analysts. “This quarter, we successfully launched personalized AI-driven marketing campaigns that, relative to traditional digital marketing campaigns, generated significant increases in consumer engagement, leading to increased purchases and a reduction in consumer churn,” said Yum CFO Chris Turner on the call with investors earlier this week. Turner declined to break out specific metrics stemming from Yum’s AI-powered marketing initiatives but offered additional color into how the fast food giant’s “AI factory” operates. For example, Taco Bell can accrue data from points of sale and digital menu boards in stores, as well as leverage the chain’s popular loyalty program and app. Linking these sources of intel together and enhancing them with AI allows for more personalized promotions and a refined picture of the customer for other marketing purposes. Yum has been running AI pilots across its three largest brands in the U.S. and believes these capabilities will be “broadly and easily scalable” while providing an overall stronger return on marketing investment, according to Turner. “We’ll continue to bring it to life across the brands and across markets as we progress,” Turner said of AI. Separately, Taco Bell is expanding its AI voice technology at drive-thrus in the U.S., aiming to implement the solution in hundreds of stores by the end of 2024. Consumer response has been “very positive” so far, Turner said. Other restaurant brands have received backlash from relying on automated technology that can offer wonky and imprecise responses. Yum, in total, has over 40 AI-driven projects in the works. Yum’s AI bullishness comes as Taco Bell continues to outperform the rest of the company’s portfolio. Same-store sales at the Mexican chain rose 4% year over year in Q3 and digital transactions soared 30%. Taco Bell in the quarter also made breakfast optional for franchisees, providing it greater flexibility to spend marketing dollars on growth drivers like its Cantina Chicken and value menus, CEO David Gibbs said on the earnings call.

Also Read: Ferrari Slows Down, Q3 Shipment Drop Hits the Brakes On Stock Growth Total reported revenues (excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange) increased 12% compared to the prior year. This was driven by a 9% increase in storage rental revenue and a 17% increase in service revenue. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% in the quarter Y/Y, driven by the increase in Global Records Information Management (RIM), Asset Lifecycle Management (ALM), and data center. AFFO was $332.0 million for the quarter, compared with $301.2 million last year, an increase of 10.2% driven by improved adjusted EBITDA. AFFO per share was $1.13, higher by 11% Y/Y. Iron Mountain’s President and CEO, William L. Meaney, highlighted the team’s remarkable strides toward ambitious growth goals, noting that the Project Matterhorn operating model elevates the business by delivering innovative, enhanced solutions for customers. Outlook: Iron Mountain affirmed full-year 2024 guidance towards the upper end of the guidance range for revenues of $6 billion–$6.15 billion versus the $6.24 billion estimate and AFFO per share of $4.39–$4.51. Iron Mountain stock gained over 83% year-to-date. When buying a stock for a longer time horizon, it is important for investors to assess where they think the stock is headed in the future.

Iron Mountain's revenue has grown at an average rate of 9.53% annually over the past 5 years. The average 1-year price target from analysts is $136.0, representing an expected 19.13% upside in 2025. While past performance is not a guarantee of future results, investors should also look at a stock's historical performance when compared to both a benchmark index and the company's peers.

Trump's win starts a \"new era after 15 years of harsher regulation\" that followed the 2008 financial crisis, he added. Big banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) rose between 11% and 13% Wednesday while Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) each rose more than 8%. The country’s largest lenders have had a great year thanks to the economy's resilience during a period of elevated interest rates and a rebound in their investment banking and trading operations. \"I congratulate President Trump and we look forward to working with the new administration,\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in a statement shared with Yahoo Finance. \"It’s clear that a new administration will bring policy changes potentially important to our business and clients,\" he added.

One big lender that may benefit from such leniency is major credit card lender Capital One (COF), which is trying to get regulatory approval to merge with credit card lender and network Discover Financial Services (DFS). The stock of the McLean, Va.-based Capital One was up 15% Wednesday. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank told analysts two weeks ago that the tie-up was expected to be completed \"early in 2025 subject to regulatory and shareholder\" approvals. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods predicts that on day one a Trump administration could make as many as eight leadership changes at the federal regulatory agencies that supervise banks or other financial services giants. That includes the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which oversee antitrust concerns, as well as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Securities and Exchange Commission, and potentially even the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The Russell 2000 (RUT) index of smaller companies was recently up more than 4%, outpacing gains seen in the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq. Several Russell companies posted large gains, with roughly a dozen recently up about 20% or more. Both the Russell and benchmark S&P are up this year, but today’s move narrows the S&P’s outperformance. It also has the Russell at year-to-date highs — and levels last seen in late 2021. TradingView The economic environment is generally seen as favorable to smaller companies, which are more sensitive to broader conditions. The Federal Reserve is also expected to cut rates again on Thursday; lower interest rates are generally understood to benefit companies that, like small caps, often carry more debt. Some analysts have also speculated that a Republican win could mean lower corporate tax rates that might particularly benefit smaller firms. ",

The dollar retreated 0.3% following its best day since 2022. Treasury yields eased after spiking across the curve on Wednesday. Markets are taking a breather Thursday after grappling with the far-reaching effects of a Trump presidency. His win has forced investors to come to terms with economic policies to could lead to fewer rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, along with a possible Republican sweep that could lead to fiscal expansion. “What we saw yesterday was the playbook of the Trump trade in action but it’s soon going to evolve,” said Arnaud Girod, head of economics and cross-asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux in Paris. “US yields can’t continue to go up with US equities on the rise, my conviction is that yields will calm down.” Later today, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will face a tough test as a second Trump term sparks concerns over inflation and market volatility. Officials are expected to lower rates by 25 basis points, a move that will come on the heels of the half-point cut in September. “What investors really want to know is: How will President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed fiscal and tariff policies affect the FOMC’s rates outlook,” Bloomberg economist Anna Wong wrote in a research note. “FOMC participants are probably wrestling with that very question.” In Asia, Chinese stocks were among the best performers on optimism Beijing will roll out more stimulus measures and on encouraging export data.

        "body": "Stocks in Hong Kong have plunged as fears mount that a second Donald Trump US presidency will hammer the already struggling Chinese economy. Shares on the Hang Seng Index, which tracks the biggest companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, closed 2.23pc lower as early results in the US election pointed to a victory for Trump. The Republican candidate has since won. The slump underlines concerns in the region about the financial fallout from a Trump presidency. He campaigned on a promise to hit Chinese imports with 60pc tariffs across the board. Duncan Wrigley, the chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “China’s exports to the US have fallen to around 15pc of the total. So 60pc tariffs or however much Trump does is likely to put a massive dent in that over time. I’m sure he will try to bargain something, but he is quite likely to follow through.” Shares in China’s largest companies were badly hit in the sell-off, with e-commerce and tech giant Alibaba sliding 4.07pc and shopping platform Meituan down 2.32pc. While the Hong Kong stock exchange slumped, mainland markets performed better. The Shanghai Composite index closed broadly flat. Mr Wrigley said Trump’s victory would probably force the world’s second-largest economy to embark on more stimulus, which could insulate domestic markets from the impact. China’s highest state body, the National People’s Congress, is currently in session and expected to make announcements on Friday. Mr Wrigley said: “It does look like that timing was set to create this opportunity to do something in case of the Trump victory. “They likely were going to do something very sizeable to start off with, but they’ll probably do a bit more because of Trump on Friday and then create the room to respond further once he becomes president next year.” Even before Trump’s victory, China’s economy had been struggling to reach the growth rates it had enjoyed pre-pandemic after an underwhelming post-Covid bounce-back and an implosion of its heavily leveraged property sector. China may borrow more to directly support the economy through investment in infrastructure projects and possibly also expanding subsidies for new car purchases, Mr Wrigley said. Some Chinese exports will likely get diverted through south-east Asia or Latin America and still end up in the US, Mr Wrigley added. However, he warned that China still faced a “significant” hit. Analysts have warned that Mr Trump’s trade war with China and the rest of the world could have profound implications for the global economy. Edmond de Rothschild, an asset manager, said in a note to clients that it would likely “fuel a new wave of inflation”.   ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Trump’s resounding win in the US election has already had a big impact, sending the dollar soaring, pushing the S&P 500 to an all-time high, and leading to a surge in Treasury yields as traders assess the inflation impact of more tariffs. It has also brought back memories of his first term. Trump’s market-moving posts included a damning verdict on trade negotiations with China, which sent stocks in the country reeling, and a tweeted threat to levy tariffs on Mexico that weakened the peso and fueled worries about the impact on auto stocks. “We used to call them Twitter bombs,” said Matthew Haupt, a portfolio manager at Wilson Asset in Sydney. “It is how he negotiates.” For many investors, Trump’s second term will mean closely monitoring X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Trump’s own social-media platform Truth Social, his primary conduit to the public. Trump’s “America First” policy, which includes sweeping tariffs on foreign-made goods, is widely expected to hurt financial assets across Europe and emerging markets. Major stock indexes in Europe and China fell as the results emerged on Wednesday, although Japanese stocks got a boost. The pace of Trump’s tweets as well as their ambiguity was a source of volatility in his first term. In 2017, his mysterious ‘covfefe’ tweet stumped markets, fueling a guessing game about a potential hidden meaning. In 2020, the former president once tweeted or retweeted just under 40 times in the space of two hours, causing a whiplash in US and international equities. “It will be 2016 all over again,” said Wong Kok Hoong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities Pte. “Markets will have to embrace more volatility and moves based on Trump’s social media comments. In fact, I have just set up a Truth Social account just to make sure we don’t miss anything!” Trump’s trade negotiations with China and others will be fertile ground for social media surprises as he rolls out his protectionist policies. During his first term, Trump frequently took to X to threaten or implement trade tariffs on allies and rivals alike that stoked a global trade war. “If you’re a HF fund, you’ve just re-weighted your natural language processing models to react to X,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group in Melbourne. “Especially through the tariff negotiations, he will take to X to push his agenda and the noise will ramp up.”          ",

        "body": "(Reuters) -Shares of pot companies slid on Wednesday after a ballot measure to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Florida failed to get the required majority to pass, even as the firms invested millions in a campaign to tap the lucrative market. Toronto-listed shares of Canopy Growth and Trulieve Cannabis tumbled 20.4% and 44.2%, respectively. Tilray Brands' shares declined more than 11%, while the U.S.-listed shares of SNDL and Cronos Group fell 13.8% and 7.2%, respectively. ETF AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis plunged 24.1%. Florida was touted as a very attractive market. An estimate from cannabis analytics company Headset had indicated $4.9 billion to $6.1 billion in adult-use sales during the first year of implementation. The passage of Amendment 3 would have legalized the sale of marijuana for recreational use to adults 21 years of age and older from medical marijuana treatment centers and other state-licensed entities. The initiative received more than 55% of the votes in favor but fell short of the 60% majority needed to pass. Twenty-four U.S. states have so far legalized the recreational use of cannabis, though it continues to be illegal at the federal level. In 2016, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment allowing medical marijuana in the state. Major pot firms had made substantial contributions to Smart & Safe Florida, the group advocating for the passage of Amendment 3. The focus now shifts to efforts to reclassify marijuana use as a less serious federal offence. President-elect Donald Trump has also publicly supported marijuana reforms and legislations in the months leading up to the election. ATB Capital Markets analyst Frederico Gomes said if marijuana use is reclassified as a less serious federal crime, it could more than offset any effects of the failure to pass the amendment.

        "body": "By Yoruk Bahceli and Lucy Raitano LONDON (Reuters) -Investors are bracing for further economic pain in Europe that could deepen euro losses and hurt its stocks, as a second Donald Trump presidency raises the prospects of hefty tariffs. European bonds emerged as winners, as expectations the European Central Bank will cut interest rates to counter an economic slowdown rose. But bets were generally contained as investors assess which of Trump's pledges will be implemented following his election victory on Wednesday. The stakes are high for a region that has navigated the pandemic, war in Ukraine and global trade tensions in recent years and comes at a time of political uncertainty in France and Germany. Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked Finance Minister Christian Lindner late on Wednesday, leaving the future of the German government unclear in Europe's biggest economy. Trump has vowed a 10% tariff on imports from all countries, a big blow for the European Union which has the second-largest trade deficit with the United States globally and is the largest exporter to the U.S, according to JPMorgan. The EU faces more pain through its close ties with China, on whose imports Trump has pledged 60% tariffs, and may need to boost defence spending if Trump pulls U.S. support for Ukraine. As traders raised ECB rate cut bets, shorter-dated German bond yields slid as prices surged. Longer-dated peers resisted a jump in U.S. Treasury yields. \"The bond market in Europe has responded by saying we should see lower growth, which can be offset by rate cuts from the ECB, but it's not going to be aggressive enough that it's going to push us into a nasty recession,\" said AXA Investment Managers' head of total return and fixed income Nick Hayes, who favours European bonds. The mood was initially brighter in European stock markets, which rose reflecting a surge in U.S. peers and relief that the result became clear quickly. But they cut their gains and were last down 0.6% in late European trade. \"The certainty is that he's back, the uncertainty is what he's going to do,\" said Hayes. In a clear sign of unease, the euro had plunged around 2% against the dollar and was set for its biggest daily drop since the height of the 2020 COVID crisis. JPMorgan, ING and ABN AMRO reckon a drop to parity could be repeated under a Trump presidency depending on the extent of tariffs, as well as tax cuts that could fuel U.S. inflation and limit U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts. IN THE BALANCE What comes next depends on the extent and pace of tariffs and tax cuts, how much they reignite U.S. inflation, and the countermeasures Europe and China take, investors said.

With Donald Trump declared the winner of the presidential election in a surprisingly lopsided victory over Kamala Harris, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) opened with gains of more than 3% and more than 2%, respectively. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) wasn’t far behind with an opening gain of 1.9%. For financial advisors and market-watchers, the stock market rally boiled down to the kind of certainty Wall Street is known to appreciate. “I wonder if some of the pop has to do with the decisiveness of the win, because so many Americans, and I think the stock market, were worried about a contested election,” said Tim Holland, chief investment officer at Orion. In terms of any kind of “Trump trade,” Holland said, “it seems to be reflationary in nature.” “This is good for the U.S. dollar and U.S. small cap stocks, and not so good for traditional fixed income and emerging markets,” he noted. Paul Schatz, president of Heritage Capital, attributed the market’s reactionary rally to the prospects of a Republican sweep of the White House and both houses of Congress, which has not yet been determined. “For short-term money, this is a good selling opportunity,” he said. “Stocks may rally for a day or three, but let’s not forget the Fed meets today and tomorrow.” Tom Graff, chief investment officer at Facet, put the post-election rally in a longer-term context by considering such factors as the future of the tax cuts that Trump passed in 2017 and are scheduled to expire next year. “A big part of why stocks are jumping is Wall Street hoping that those tax cuts remain in place or even taxes get cut further,” he said. In regards to a Trump trade, Graff said, “the markets believe that Trump’s tariff plans will cause more inflation.” “The TIPS market is pricing in about 0.15% higher inflation over the next couple of years based strictly on today’s move,” he added. “Rates are also moving because markets believe Trump will run a larger deficit, which means the government will have to sell more Treasury bonds and that pushes interest rates higher.”  Permalink | © Copyright 2024 etf.com.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The Markit CDX North American High Yield Index, which rises as perceived credit risk declines, reached nearly 108 on Wednesday, its highest level since January 2022. Measures of credit risk in Europe and Asia also fell, as a question mark that had loomed over markets all year was resolved even if a second Trump administration brings the potential for trade wars. “We now have permanency, and likely some further easing, of the Trump corporate-tax policy passed during his first administration,” said Scott Kimball, chief investment officer at Loop Capital Asset Management. “That’s good for the top and bottom line. It should stimulate investment, which is good for revenues, and it is a positive for cash flows — which is king for credit investors.” Trump’s victory brought gains across riskier markets. US equities hit all-time highs and Bitcoin hit a record on bets that Trump’s pro-business stance will boost the US economy. But lower corporate tax rates could also boost US government deficits, potentially forcing the US to borrow more. That weighed on Treasury prices. That risk is part of why some investors think the credit rally could fade over time. Bill Zox, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, sees bond yields rising because of a strong economy, high government spending and “animal spirits,” potentially creating pressure on corporate debt and other risk assets. Sectors with exposure to global trade and tariffs — such as technology — could be vulnerable to a shift in trade policy. “A Trump win was always going to be good for risk initially, but not all of his likely policies — such as global trade wars — are going to be credit friendly over the intermediate term,” according to Loop Capital’s Kimball. Winners and Losers In the near term, many money managers and strategists are looking at the potential positives. Noel Hebert, a Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst, sees spreads remaining tight as long as there’s no renewed possibility of the Federal Reserve starting to increase rates again. The US central bank’s next policy statement, which is expected to include the second rate cut of this cycle, will be released on Thursday.                  ",

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all soared to new intraday highs Wednesday morning. Trump's decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris was a blow to the green agenda of the Biden-Harris administration, which significantly ramped up government spending on clean energy alternatives. Trump's White House Win Sends Dow Up 1,000 Points Read On The Fox Business App Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 invested $369 billion in what Democrats labeled \"Energy Security and Climate Change\" provisions, translating to billions of dollars of incentives and tax breaks intended to reduce carbon emissions 40% by 2030. Trump, on the other hand, has promised to \"drill, baby, drill,\" embracing America's fossil fuel industry. The president-elect has vowed to scrap offshore wind projects through an executive order on his first day in office and to roll back the climate regulations implemented under Biden. Following Trump's victory, Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to clients, \"A full repeal of the IRA would depend on Congress, although significant changes might be possible.\" Tesla Stock Surges After Trump Win Presidency Price Futures Group senior market analyst and FOX Business contributor Phil Flynn also suggested in his daily energy report Wednesday morning that Trump will bring major changes to the energy landscape, and blasted Biden's policies. \"President Trump will reverse many of Biden’s short sighted executive orders on energy that helped fuel inflation and caused much concern against the producers of U.S. oil and gas,\" Flynn wrote. \"Biden’s policies have been an abject failure on improving the environment. We’ve seen billions of dollars of wasted government spending and yet we have seen the failure of the administration to make any real gains on their climate pledges.\" Flynn added, \"And while the outlook for US oil and gas is now going to be great again, we still must face a potential supply squeeze that is coming in part because of the Biden administration discouragement in oil and gas projects.\"    ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The carmaker’s chief executive officer was arguably the most prominent supporter of Republicans this election cycle, backing them with more than $130 million in spending and relentless messaging on X, his social media network. While Trump criticized EVs throughout his campaign, he softened his tone somewhat after Musk’s endorsement. “Let me tell you, we have a new star, a star is born: Elon,” Trump said during an address to supporters at his election watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida. He spoke about Musk for almost four minutes, praising his company SpaceX and calling him a “special guy” and “super genius.” Tesla shares jumped as much as 15% Wednesday to $289.59, their highest intraday since July 2023. That stood in marked contrast to other EV makers, with Rivian Automotive Inc. tumbling 10% and Lucid Group Inc. falling 8%. European automakers also slumped over concern about Trump’s threats to hike tariffs on imported cars. “The biggest positive from a Trump win would be for Tesla and Musk,” Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, wrote in a report to clients. Tesla would be at a competitive advantage over other manufacturers in the event the US reduces tax incentives for electric vehicles, he said. Trump’s opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, likely would have maintained policies supporting US production and sales of EVs, including the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law two years ago. But Musk had already soured on Biden before then, in large part due to the Democrat’s embrace of unions and failure to credit Tesla for leading the EV transition. Multiple EV-related provisions could now be targets for repeal — especially if Republicans take both houses of Congress, BloombergNEF analysts warned last week. Fuel-economy and emissions requirements are also likely to undergo rewrites, as they did during Trump’s first term, which could limit the revenue Tesla generates from selling regulatory credits to manufacturers struggling to comply with Biden’s tougher rules. Regulatory Relief Musk has downplayed the threat of any pullback in government incentives for EVs while emphasizing the potential for companies to benefit from deregulation.             ",

Shares of US-listed Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) fell as much as 4.5%, while JD.com (JD) dropped as much as 7.7%, Bilibili (BILI) stock fell up to 7.8%, Baidu (BIDU) sank as much as 2.9%, and PDD Holdings (PDD) tumbled up to 5.1%. The stocks pared losses as the day continued. Overnight in China, the Hang Seng Index (^HSI) dropped 2.2% while the Shanghai Composite Index (000001.SS) fell less than 0.1%. During the campaign, Trump promised to implement tariffs at levels unseen since the Great Depression. The president-elect suggested imposing 10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China, which would cost US families an extra $1,700 to $2,600 per year, according to a September report from the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. The United States imported $3.8 trillion worth of goods in 2023. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? Trump, in his last term, was largely successful in enacting restrictive trade policies, and as Yahoo Finance’s Ben Werschkul has reported, Trump has considerable authority to act unilaterally to make good on his latest tariff promises. The Peterson Institute, in its report, said that such trade policies from Trump could also result in retaliatory tariffs on US goods imported by other countries, squeezing US businesses. “To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff, and it’s my favorite word,” Trump told Bloomberg in an interview on Oct. 15 at the Economic Club of Chicago. “It needs a public relations firm.” Trump has said he will enact such tariffs “quickly.” Coupled with his proposed mass deportation effort and immigration curbs, Trump's tariffs could hit GDP growth by roughly 1% and add 1% to inflation, according to a report from Capital Economics published late Tuesday. Trump has proposed using such tariffs to fund government programs rather than using income taxes. Still, those tariffs would likely raise more than $200 billion annually, far short of the estimated $7.75 trillion in federal debt Trump’s other policies are expected to rack up. To be sure, both parties have taken restrictive stances on trade with China. The Biden administration increased tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports from China in May. While Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris was critical of the Trump campaign’s tariff proposals, she was expected to keep current higher duties in place.        ",

A recent analysis from Drewry said the victory for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump “carries more disruptive risk for the container shipping market based on past performance,” noting that a trade war escalation is much more likely under a second Trump administration. More from Sourcing Journal A Trump Victory Signals a Wave of Imports Ahead of Expected Tariffs What Wall Street Thinks About A Possible Red Sweep Goldman Sachs: Possible Post-Election Policy Shifts in Trade Trump is expected to impose universal tariffs of 20 percent on all U.S. imports, while China-made goods could get slapped with a 60 percent tariff. “Such levies would ultimately be paid by U.S. consumers, inevitably dampening overall demand for containerized imports and especially those from China,” said Simon Heaney, senior manager of container research at Drewry, during the consultancy’s Freight Loop. Freight rates could see another uptick after escalating in 2024. Data from Xeneta’s Shipping Index indicated that average spot freight rates out of China to the U.S. West Coast doubled from $1,340 per 40-foot container on June 29, 2018—shortly ahead of the tariffs former President Trump first introduced in July that year—to $2,692 per container on Nov. 1. These numbers did decline to $1,679 per container by Jan. 2, 2019, but were still 25 percent ahead of the late June prices. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has stated that the proposed tariffs would not result in price hikes. A disruption to the supply chain status quo would not solely include negative connotations. Trump’s first wave of tariffs spurred on more supply chain diversification into the U.S. via container ship, coinciding with a large market share erosion for China. “More diversification of trade on its own isn’t really a problem for container shipping,” Heaney said. “In fact, it’s a positive as greater fragmentation of production would mean more shipping of intermediate parts…Any escalation in the trade war would further encourage U.S. businesses to seek alternatives to China such as Vietnam, India or Mexico.” China’s value share in dollars of U.S. container imports has shrunk by around 13 percentage points from before Trump’s first term in office, according to data from Trade Data Monitor, falling from 40 percent in 2016 to 27 percent after eight months of 2024.

        "body": "By Karin Strohecker, Noe Torres and Rodrigo Campos LONDON/MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Mexico's peso was narrowly weaker on Wednesday after largely recovering from a slump earlier in the day to its lowest level in more than two years, as analysts said the slide in response to Donald Trump's U.S. election victory was overdone. While the U.S. election extended a streak of volatility and weakness for emerging markets, Mexico was seen as particularly vulnerable given its exposure to the U.S. economy, its biggest export market. The peso weakened 0.4% at 1436 ET, trading at 20.2048 per dollar, after dropping in early trading as low as 20.8100 per dollar for the first time since August 2022, a fall some analysts said may have been overdone. \"I think some of it was priced in the currency already, though there’s big domestic factors impacting (the peso) as well,\" said Shamaila Khan, head of fixed income for emerging markets and Asia Pacific at UBS Asset Management. \"Volatility could be both ways, because when you have super majority, there are a lot of good things the government can do as well,\" Khan added, referring to the political strength of the country's ruling Morena coalition. Emerging market currencies have shown mixed behavior against a soaring dollar, with the Brazilian real gaining over 1% and Chile's peso chalking up the biggest losses in Latin America. The Mexican peso has shed over 18% of its value so far this year against the U.S. dollar, posting sharp setbacks after Mexico's election in the summer roiled domestic assets. Rodolfo Ramos, head of Mexico research at Brazilian bank Bradesco, said a Trump administration was not an unknown and this was now \"an attractive entry point\" for investors. \"Mexico has already worked with him successfully,\" he said in a note to clients. \"We see uncertainty on tariffs in the short term, but we remain positive on nearshoring over the medium and long run.\" After Trump's 2016 presidential victory, the peso plummeted around 8.5% against the dollar to a then-historic low. While markets evaluate the effects of trade barriers Trump has threatened, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum tried to play down concerns about a drastic rupture. FUTURE CONCERNS Still, Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING, said he would not rule out a move to 22.00 pesos to the dollar over the coming weeks. He added that 2025 could be a \"rough year for the peso\" ahead of the USMCA trade pact review in 2026. Citi's Luis Costa said in a note to clients that the Wall Street bank had put on a short position of the Mexican peso vs the South African rand, expecting the Latin American currency to weaken in that pairing.

His promise to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk head of a government efficiency commission after the billionaire backed Trump throughout his electoral campaign sparked a 15% surge in shares of the electric automaker. Wall Street's main indexes jumped to record highs, with the Dow Jones industrial average rallying almost 4% and the S&P 500 more than 2% higher. The small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped almost 6% to its highest in nearly three years. \"Business animal spirits could be rekindled once again from Trump's pro-business approach, which could lead to a more robust capital expenditures and investment environment,\" said Jeff Schulze, market strategist at ClearBridge Investments. Trump Media & Technology Group, majority-owned by Trump, jumped 6%. The company late on Tuesday reported quarterly results that showed the Truth Social parent's revenue was just $1 million. The stock has more than tripled in value from its lows in late September, valuing Trump's stake at over $4 billion. POLICY DETAILS AWAITED Trump's Republican Party also secured the Senate and was making gains in the House of Representatives, potentially making it easier for the president to legislate his proposals and push through key appointments. Markets \"have priced in a pretty strong mandate for the Republicans and are biasing toward most of the Trump trades,\" said Scott Chronert, U.S. equity strategist at Citi. \"The market focus seems to be putting more emphasis on deregulation, tax cuts and a more business-friendly backdrop.\" Wall Street lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs jumped between 8% and 13% on prospects of looser regulations and more deals. \"There is an expectation that the regulatory landscape will ease under the Trump administration\" and that is helping financials' shares, said David Ellison, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds, which holds several bank stocks. Investors will also be anxious to see how Basel III, a set of global banking regulations, will be implemented by the next administration, said Greg Hertrich, head of U.S. depository strategies at Nomura. The latest version of the proposal called for a 9% rise in banks' capital. \"Whether the banks will need 9%, 6%, 4% or 0% more capital creates very different scenarios,\" he said.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The Republican victory stirred up tariff threats for developing economies, adding volatility to markets already bracing for today’s US Federal Reserve decision. The election results initially jolted emerging markets, with MSCI’s equity index taking its steepest hit in a week on Wednesday and 10 of 23 currencies tracked by Bloomberg posting losses of 1% or more against the dollar. But calmer sentiment returned on the next day. MSCI’s developing-markets index was up 0.7% in early European hours, led by Asian stocks like Meituan, Tencent Holdings, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. In currencies, the offshore yuan bounced back from its sharpest plunge since 2019, triggered by Trump’s victory. Chinese state banks intervened, traders said, selling dollars to stabilize the yuan. The Korean won and the Indonesian rupiah also advanced. South Africa’s rand, highly sensitive to China’s fortunes, emerged as Thursday’s standout, benefiting from an anticipated stimulus boost. Investors now await potential fiscal stimulus measures as a Chinese legislative meeting wraps up Friday, hoping for new steps to offset the impact of any tariffs. The optimism deepened with China’s October export data showing a rapid acceleration — the fastest since July 2022, and beyond any economist’s forecast. The US Federal Reserve’s rate decision will move into focus in the latter half of the session. Fed officials are widely expected to cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points, following a half-point reduction in September. Yet the trajectory beyond today remains uncertain. “A lot of what Trump is proposing is inflationary, more so in the US than internationally, which can disrupt the Fed’s easing cycle,” said Brendan McKenna, a strategist at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. “A Fed cutting less aggressively should act as a tail-wind for the dollar,” he said. Among emerging-market central banks, Czech policymakers will likely press on with an eighth consecutive interest-rate cut as weak economic growth for now trumps concerns about inflationary risks. Before the week winds up, rate setters in Peru will likely trim the nation’s borrowing costs by a quarter point, to 5%, with inflation running right around the mid-point of its 1%-to-3% target range.

S&P said it was affirming Wabash’s BB- issuer credit rating. It also has a B+ issue-level rating on the company’s senior unsecured notes, as well as a recovery rating of 5. Those were both affirmed by S&P. A negative outlook at S&P Global means conditions are in place that may lead to a downgrade in a company’s rating. The recovery rating is on a scale of 1 to 6, and S&P defines that rating as measuring “the recovery prospects of a given loan or bond from a speculative-grade issuer, calculated on a nominal basis, based on future hypothetical default scenarios.” A 6 rating is highest on the scale. Rival ratings agency Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) has not taken any action on Wabash National. Moody’s has a rating of Ba3 on Wabash National, having upgraded the company last December. Moody’s Ba3 and S&P’s BB- are considered equivalent. Both the Moody’s and S&P Global ratings are three notches below investment-grade. Moody’s outlook on Wabash is listed as stable. The new negative outlook for Wabash (NYSE: WNC), the ratings agency said, is based on its “expectation that … free operating cash flow to debt will remain in the high single digit area in 2024 and 2025 as the ongoing freight recession extends beyond our previous expectation.” It added that the number could rise above 10% in 2026 if there is increased freight demand. A spokeswoman for Wabash declined comment. That Wabash National is struggling financially is not news. Third-quarter revenue was down 26.7% year on year, and the $464 million it reported was about $13.3 million less than Wall Street forecasts, according to SeekingAlpha.

Income from operations was $29.1 million compared with $89.4 million a year ago. Wabash National stock is down 16.9% in the past year, closing Tuesday at $18.04. Away from the financials, operating numbers at Wabash National paint a decidedly negative picture. The earnings report said Wabash shipped 7,585 trailers in the third quarter, compared with 10,765 a year ago. Shipments of new truck bodies declined to 3,630 from 4,160.                ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Market watchers see the possibility of funds flowing into India and Japan while investors assess Trump’s anti-China stance, with the president-elect earlier having threatened to put tariffs of as much as 60% on Chinese goods. Morgan Stanley just reiterated its preference for the two nations’ shares over China’s. India, viewed as a manufacturing alternative to China, is appealing to investors for its relative immunity to global risks given a domestic-driven economy. Japanese stocks are seen as indirect beneficiaries of Trump’s reflationary economic policy — which is expected to keep interest rates high, thereby boosting the dollar and weakening the yen to the advantage of the Asian nation’s exporters. “Supply chains have been moving away from China and that helps not only Japan and India but also other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia,” said veteran emerging-market investor Mark Mobius. “India is the big beneficiary since only India’s workforce can match the Chinese in numbers and labor costs. With Trump maintaining or even extending trade restrictions on China, this will be positive for India.” The threat of tariffs is seen complicating Beijing’s efforts to revive the economy and lift market sentiment through a series of stimulus measures that began late September. This makes the nation’s ongoing legislature meeting all the more crucial for investors. “Should China’s anticipated stimulus announcements be less meaningful than expected, we believe investors could also rotate China exposure into Japanese equities which was seen prior to China’s initial round of stimulus announcements,” Morningstar Inc.’s analysts Lorraine Tan and Kai Wang wrote in a note. Chinese stocks were already under pressure in the run-up to the US election, with the rally triggered by a monetary policy blitz cooling in the absence of an impressive plan for fiscal spending.

Amazon.com Inc. hit a record of its own on Wednesday, and also recently reported strong results. “So far I’m encouraged, because it seems like fundamentals remain intact,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. “The market has been wanting to see that there’s a benefit from all the spending on AI, and these reports indicate that it’s so. I think the rally will continue, and if you have any sort of long-term investment horizon, you need to be in these names.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek What Looked Like a Toss-Up Turned Into a Red Wave.

        "body": "Schaeffler, a German automotive and industrial supplier, has announced plans to cut approximately 4,700 jobs across Europe. This decision is part of a move to bolster the company's long-term competitiveness in a “challenging market environment”, characterised by intense global competition and significant changes within the automotive supply industry, the company said. Schaeffler's board has approved structural measures with a focus on Germany and Europe to improve earnings, particularly within the bearings & industrial solutions division. This division has been facing economic difficulties, structural issues, and fierce competition. Additionally, Schaeffler aims to achieve synergies following its merger with Vitesco, which will include revenue and purchasing benefits, as well as some workforce reductions. The third aspect of the restructuring plan is a response to the ongoing transformation in the automotive supply sector. This involves adapting to the decreasing demand for internal combustion engine technology and the current slowdown in new electric drive programmes in Europe. Specifically, the job cuts will result in a gross reduction of about 4,700 positions, with nearly 2,800 of these in Germany. Ten locations in Germany and five elsewhere in Europe will be affected, including the closure of two sites. The majority of these measures are scheduled to be implemented between 2025 and 2027. Schaeffler anticipates these structural changes will lead to potential annual savings of approximately €290m ($311.7m) starting in 2029. Schaeffler CEO Klaus Rosenfeld said: “Given the current business environment, this program is necessary to safeguard the Schaeffler Group’s competitiveness over the long term. We will implement it in a socially equitable and carefully considered manner.” The announcement follows a drop in the company's net income attributable to shareholders, which decreased to €250m in the first nine months of 2024, compared with €416m in the previous year. Despite this, revenue remained relatively stable at €12.23bn for the reporting period. \"Schaeffler to lay off 4,700 employees in Europe as market challenges mount \" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.

The Federal Trade Commission sued fintech Dave on Tuesday for allegedly misleading consumers and luring them to its cash advance application with the promise of obtaining up to $500 in loans, which they failed to receive. The FTC said the online platform charged consumers who need financial assistance with undisclosed fees and “tips” without their consent, adding that Dave’s conduct violates the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act. “Dave lured in consumers living paycheck-to-paycheck with false claims of big-dollar advances, then reached into their pockets to give itself a so-called ‘tip,’” Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement Tuesday. “Whether the products are called cash advances, payday loans, or something else, the FTC will take action to protect consumers from unauthorized charges and deceptive claims.” The FTC’s action comes close to a similar lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against Los Angeles-based fintech SoLo Funds in May, asserting that it deceived borrowers regarding the actual cost of loans on the platform due to its “tip” structure. Dave promised “instant” or “on the spot” access to advances but required consumers to pay an “Express Fee” of anywhere between $3 and $25 to avoid a wait of two to three business days, according to the lawsuit, filed in a U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  In many cases, Dave takes an additional 15% of the advance the consumers receive, referring to it as a “tip.” Many consumers are unaware of that fee or how to avoid it, the FTC said. “The interface is set up to trick you into giving the tip,” one customer said in the complaint. “I feel cheated/scammed by this whole process.” Another said, “[T]hey make you give a tip when you don’t want to give one.” On the same day the FTC announced its action, Dave reported revenue of $92.5 million for the third quarter — a 41% year-over-year jump. The company's net income for the three-month span included a $7 million legal settlement and litigation reserve related to the FTC lawsuit, the company said. With the FTC’s action against the company, Dave CEO Jason Wilk said he wanted to “reiterate the positive outlook” for the business and emphasize that the company was “well-positioned to sustain a vigorous defense and bring this matter to resolution.”          ",

        "body": "By Michael S. Derby NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial markets are heading into this week's Federal Reserve meeting with more clarity over the outlook for the U.S. central bank's ongoing balance sheet drawdown than they've had in a while, and those keeping close tabs on the process see it continuing into next year even as the Fed keeps cutting interest rates. The clarity is largely tied to a new index from the New York Fed that charts pressures in short-term market liquidity. Called Reserve Demand Elasticity, it appears to front-run liquidity shortages, and in its first outing showed money markets still flush with cash. That in turn means the Fed faces no serious roadblocks to continue with the now two-year-old process of shedding bonds from its balance sheet, which is known as quantitative tightening, or QT. \"Runoff will last into (the first quarter) and perhaps even beyond, we believe, judging by the NY Fed's new real-time Reserve Demand Elasticity measure,\" analysts at LH Meyer said in a research note late last month. A New York Fed survey ahead of the September policy meeting saw QT ending in the spring of next year. The New York Fed index and its findings go to the heart of one of the key components of the Fed's monetary policy regime, which is to extract unneeded liquidity it had added to markets during the COVID pandemic and its aftermath. The Fed aggressively bought Treasury and mortgage bonds starting in March 2020, first to stabilize markets and then to add stimulus when its main monetary policy tool, the federal funds target rate, was at near-zero levels. Those purchases more than doubled the Fed's balance sheet to a peak of about $9 trillion by the summer of 2022. That same year the Fed began to allow bonds it owned to mature and not be replaced, and it has shed about $2 trillion of those securities so far. In that recent NY Fed survey, markets reckoned Fed holdings would contract to around $6.4 trillion. The Fed is aiming to pull out enough liquidity to enable it to retain firm control over the federal funds rate and to allow for normal periods of money market volatility. The challenge is that there is no clear way to know how far to take QT. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Oct. 14 \"there is no economic theory for how large a central bank balance sheet should be.\" In terms of when QT might end, New York Fed President John Williams on Oct. 10 said \"I don't actually know, because it depends on what happens\" with money market rates.

Former President Donald Trump has won a second term as president of the United States after a strong showing at the polls. He will be the nation’s 47th president. Importantly, Trump won the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. A confirmed win in Wisconsin — another swing state — put Trump over the top, with 277 electoral college votes as of early Wednesday. Republicans are also set to take control of the Senate for the first time in four years following key wins in West Virginia and Ohio. Control of the House remained in the balance on Wednesday afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) skyrocketed more than 1,300 points to a record 43,569 by midday as investors raced to price in tax cuts, among other policies Trump has floated. Strong gains were also notched on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). \"I don't know that it's too much too soon,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). \"If you think about it coming into this [election], there was a real contention between the [outcomes]. So once you gain some clarity, and it looks like this won't extend or be a contested election, there's a relief rally.\" Trump's round two has unleashed a host of key trades too. Tesla stock (TSLA) surged 14% to $286 during the session. The company's ticker page was the most active on Yahoo Finance through midday. The win could put Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the pole position to shape electric vehicles' future given his strong backing of Trump. “Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years,” Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a client note. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices are also moving higher, with Trump promising during his campaign to make the US a digital currency superpower. The move also likely reflects an investor bet on an SEC shakeup that could result in a more digital asset-friendly chairman. “With Trump leading the US presidential race and GOP likely to flip the Senate, we believe the regulatory headwind for crypto has turned into a tailwind and the market is nowhere close to factoring in this shift,” Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani said.

Shutterstock/TS \"The return of the Trump Administration will likely usher in a more hands-off approach to regulation that will impact both passenger protections and mergers.,\" writes Matthew Klint of the Live And Let's Fly publication. \"American Airlines is already exploring a fresh alliance with JetBlue and I expect we will see a full return of the Northeast Alliance with very little pushback from U.S. regulators.\" Analysts also expect a rollback of some of the traveler protection victories secured by current Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, including the law requiring airlines to offer passengers automatic refunds in the case of cancellations passed at the start of the month. While some current protections will remain cemented in law, others may be taken up by an administration that has repeatedly talked about decreasing business regulation.

The world's richest people saw huge gains in their net worth on Wednesday as markets cheered the outcome of the 2024 election. Elon Musk, Larry Ellison, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang saw their wealth soar on Wednesday, propelled by huge stock gains after former President Donald Trump sailed to victory in the presidential election. Together, the billionaires gained almost $53 billion by the time the market closed on Wednesday. Their gains were driven by euphoric stock investors, who see a coming era of less regulation and lower taxes driving higher corporate profits. These were the top net-worth gainers on Wednesday, according to Forbes' real-time billionaires list.

The billionaire's wealth is tied to his stake in his many companies, primarily Tesla and SpaceX. His gain on Wednesday came as Tesla stock rose almost 15%, even as other EV stocks sold off amid fears Trump will pull back on Biden-era rebates and tax incentives. Traders are betting both Musk and his company will benefit from close ties to Trump as the former president retakes office. \"In our view, TSLA and CEO Elon Musk are perhaps the biggest winners from the election result,\" CFRA Research senior analyst Garrett Nelson said in a Wednesday note.

TikTok has published a new guide to help marketers capitalize on their opportunities in “Q5”, which is an extra time period that some marketers have now made up, covering the post-Christmas to early new year period. This is when many people are in holiday mode, and are looking for post-Christmas bargains, which could present new opportunities to connect with these shoppers, and maximize your sales. As explained by TikTok: “Q5, the period right after the holiday season, is a prime opportunity for brands to capture consumer attention. Audiences on TikTok are actively seeking new deals, trends, and products to kickstart their new year. Drive post-holiday sales during this hidden gem of a shopping moment.” To help with this, TikTok’s new, 13-page Q5 marketing guide includes a range of insights to help improve your Q5 outreach, including notes on TikTok usage during the period. Indeed, TikTok says that interest in shopping-related content in the app remains strong moving into the new year. Though the focus for some users does change. As you can see in this overview, “self care” becomes more of a focus post-Christmas. Also worth noting where Q5 shoppers will be looking to purchase from, with online sales seemingly resonating with these consumers. The guide also includes insight into how to create an effective TikTok campaign: While there are also more comprehensive overviews of different sales approaches in the app, and how to make best use of TikTok’s options. There’s a heap of insight here, and while I’m not fully on board with the “Q5” branding, highlighting this as its own marketing period does make some sense, because the focus of consumers in this period is different, and as such, your offers should also evolve in-step. Get this right, and it could end up being a valuable focus for your branding and direct sales efforts, helping to boost your end-of-year results. You can download TikTok’s Q5 marketing guide here. ",

Weis’ net sales totaled $1.19 billion during the period, up 2.2% from the same quarter a year ago. Net income rose 11.3% from 2023, to $25.84 million. “We continue to make progress in a post-inflationary environment affecting our year-over-year comparisons,” Weis Markets Chairman, President, and CEO Jonathan Weis said in a statement. “Despite the challenge, we posted a solid comparable-store sales increase in the period and generated net income results that remain in line with our expectations.” Year to date, Weis’ net sales totaled $3.55 billion, up 1.8% from the same period a year ago. Year-to-date comparable-store sales, excluding fuel, increased 2.2% or 5.3% on a two-year, stacked basis. Year-to-date net income was $75.26 million, a decrease of 9.7% from the year-ago period. “We attribute our results to our popular Weis Rewards loyalty marketing program, continuing our investments in our Low, Low Price program of more than 10,000 high-demand products which added 448 household essential items across eight non-food categories during the period, and disciplined store-level efficiencies that help us effectively balance customer experience and cost management,” Weis said. “The hard work and commitment of our associates have been crucial to our progress.” In September, the grocer announced plans to acquire two-unit Sunnyway Foods, a family-owned retailer that had been in business in Pennsylvania for nearly 70 years.

Amid the uncertain frenzy of major current events, people look to betting as they try to make sense of the unknown. So, it tracks that prediction market Polymarket has become increasingly popular throughout the 2024 U.S. election, which has seen Polymarket users place $3.3 billion in bets on Trump vs. Harris. However, that massive volume is more complicated than it looks, my colleague Leo Schwartz reported recently: Two blockchain research firms, Chaos Labs and Inca Digital, have found signs that wash trading—a tactic to artificially inflate trading activity—constitutes a sizable portion of this volume. This naturally raises concerns about Polymarket's accuracy as a prediction tool—the goal of any prediction market, fun aside, is to predict, after all. I talked to Schwartz about it over a Slack call on election day yesterday, as good a time as any to meditate on what it means to make sense of uncertainty. As I was writing this story, Polymarket was giving Donald Trump a 61% chance of winning the election. That said, odds are really just that. How seriously should we be taking prediction markets? \"I think we should just take a step back and do a little critical thinking about whether we should really be taking them seriously, or at least what other dynamics might be at play in creating those odds,” Schwartz told me. Schwartz says prediction markets, in a way that’s not all that different from polling, are “metrics of sentiment.” And if the underdog ultimately wins, that doesn’t mean the prediction markets were wrong, either. Much like a poll, the prediction markets are a snapshot. They offer pieces of data, not promises. \"If by the time people are reading this Kamala has won, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the prediction markets were wrong,” said Schwartz. “It just means that there were more people putting money down saying 'I think there’s a better chance that Trump is going to win.'” This seemed like a good way to re-introduce you to Leo, who’s been featured in Term Sheet before and whose work I deeply admire.

MSCI said there would be 156 Indian stocks in the index, but that is only one-fourth of China's 598, signalling scope for further inclusion of Indian stocks on the index. The changes will take place after the markets close on Nov. 25, MSCI said. The inclusion of the stocks will lift India's weightage in the index to a record 19.8% from 19.3% earlier, narrowing the gap with China, which has slipped to 26.8% from 27%, Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research estimated. It will also likely attract $2.5 billion in passive inflows into India's equity markets, Nuvama said. China has the highest weightage in the MSCI Global Standard index, while India has been in second place since the end of 2021. Air conditioner maker Voltas, realty developer Oberoi Realty, stock exchange operator BSE, Kalyan Jewellers, and drug maker Alkem Laboratories are the latest additions to the index. Indian markets saw inflows of about $3 billion into equities after the previous MSCI rebalancing in August when seven stocks were added. \"We remain extremely bullish on India, especially with active participation from mutual funds and high net worth individuals (HNIs)/retail investors, and anticipate many more inclusions in the emerging markets index,\" said Abhilash Pagaria, head of Nuvama research. Seven existing stocks, including top private lender HDFC Bank and Tata Power, saw an increase in their weightage. HDFC Bank is now the highest-weighted Indian stock in the MSCI indices at 7.08%, surpassing Reliance Industries' 6.08%. No Indian companies have been removed from the MSCI Global Standard Index so far in November.

Revenue was boosted by the Pharmacy & Wellness division, which saw sales up 12% to $32.4 billion, aided by higher prescription volume, Sales at the Health Care Benefits segment advanced some 25% to $33 billion on growth in Medicare and commercial product lines. The company said Health Services unit revenue dropped 5.9%, chiefly because of the loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. Reuters in January reported that Tyson Foods (TSN) replaced CVS Health with Rightway to manage employee drug benefits. Joyner took over as CEO last month. CVS in a separate statement said former UnitedHealth Group (UNH) executive Steve Nelson will become head of its Aetna insurance arm, and Prem Shah, the current chief pharmacy officer and president of the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness division, will become group president.

        "body": "By Lewis Krauskopf and Amanda Cooper NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election unleashed a massive rally in the dollar, drove stocks to record highs and punished bond prices as expectations of tax cuts and tariffs on imports drove optimism about economic growth while fueling worries about inflation. U.S. equity indexes soared, with the benchmark S&P 500 up 2.51% to a record high and huge gains in areas such as small-cap stocks and banks that are poised to benefit from Trump's expected lighter regulatory touch. The dollar hit its highest level in over four months. Bitcoin hit record highs and Treasuries were battered. \"Everywhere you look, there's the thumbprints of these election results for markets,\" said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Trump's pledges to raise tariffs, cut taxes and slash regulations encouraged investors to dive into a range of assets that looked likely to benefit from such policies. Markets that could suffer under tougher tariffs bore the brunt of the sell-off. The Mexican peso slumped to its lowest level in over two years while the euro was set for its largest daily drop since 2020. Currency trading was intense. CME Group said by 10 a.m. CT, online trading of the Offshore Chinese Renminbi already had hit $33 billion in notional value, an all-time high. In the same time span, the traded notional value of futures contracts on the Mexican peso was 43% above the average daily volume. Bolstering confidence in \"Trump trades,\" Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate. Investors were still awaiting results in the House of Representatives, and Republican control would clear the path for Trump's agenda. The election could have far-reaching implications for tax and trade policy, as well as U.S. institutions, affecting assets globally. INTEREST RATES SEEN HIGHER Investors sold U.S. Treasuries, partly on the expectation that higher tariffs would inevitably filter through to consumer prices, but also because Trump's promises on spending could boost government debt levels. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 4.48%, its highest level in over four months but retreated slightly. \"If he's able to fully implement his agenda, it means bigger deficits, bigger tax cuts, and also, because of tariffs, higher inflation,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"The higher inflation and the bigger deficits should push up long-term interest rates.\"          ",

Gilead shares rose more than 3% after it reported its results and revised forecast. The Foster City, California-based company posted an adjusted quarterly profit of $2.02 per share on revenue of $7.5 billion, ahead of average analyst estimates of $1.55 per share and $7 billion, according to LSEG data. Due to \"the strength of our overall business model ... we're increasing our 2024 guidance across every metric,\" Gilead Chief Executive Officer Daniel O’Day told Reuters. He said Gilead plans to file before the end of this year for U.S. regulatory approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection to prevent HIV infection. The company's shares had closed up 1.6% at $91.69 on Wednesday, before climbing more than 3% in after hours trading to $94.60. Gilead said net earnings for the quarter fell to $1.00 per share, from $1.73 a year earlier, due in part to a $1.75 billion impairment charge related to its 2020 acquisition of cancer drug developer Immunomedics. Third-quarter sales of HIV drug Biktarvy rose 13% to $3.5 billion, while sales of in hospital COVID-19 treatment Veklury rose 9% to $692 million. Oncology sales were up 6% to $816 million, while liver disease drugs brought in $733 million, up 4% from a year ago. For full-year 2024, Gilead raised its product sales forecast to a range of $27.8 billion to $28.1 billion from a previous view of $27.1 billion to $27.5 billion. The company now expects an adjusted profit of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, up from $3.60 to $3.90. Analysts have projected full-year earnings of $3.81 per share on revenue of $27.72 billion. Gilead has shown good control of spending and the uptick in its full-year earnings estimate \"was a little bit higher than we had expected, mostly because of Veklury,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note.

The stock has traded mostly sideways to higher on low trading volumes since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite's next move. Investors should monitor key lower price levels on Nvidia's chart around $144, $125 and $97, while watching an important higher level near $180.  Nvidia (NVDA) this week surged into the top position among the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization, surpassing iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). The AI chipmaker’s shares gained about 4% on Wednesday, hitting a record high of $146.49, as U.S. equities soared following the election of Donald Trump as president. Nvidia shares have risen nearly three-fold since the start of the year amid insatiable demand for the company’s family of AI chips, including its next generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs). Below, we analyze the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors may be watching. Since breaking out from a symmetrical triangle last month, Nvidia shares have traded mostly sideways to higher as investors look for future catalysts that may drive the AI favorite’s next move. It’s worth pointing out that in recent months, the stock’s volume has tracked steadily lower, potentially indicating that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the US election and amid uncertainty over chip export curbs. Looking ahead, investors should monitor for increasing share turnover while eyeing these important price levels on Nvidia’s chart. The first lower level to watch sits at $144, an area on the chart just below Wednesday's closing price where the shares may encounter support near a period of consolidation positioned around the prior all-time high (ATH). Further selling could see Nvidia shares fall to around $125, an area on the chart where they currently find support near the closely watched 50-day moving average and symmetrical triangle’s upper trendline. A breakdown below this level could see the stock fall to the $97 region. Investors may seek entry points at this location near a trendline joining two March peaks with a series of prices positioned around the early-August low. To forecast a higher level using technical analysis, we can apply the measuring principle, often referred to as a measured move.    ",

        "body": "Investing and taxes go hand-in-hand. When you sell a stock for a profit inside a taxable brokerage account, you’ll owe taxes on the realized gain. But the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offers tax breaks as well, including the ability for investors to deduct stock losses. These losses, called capital losses, serve to lower your taxable income and reduce your tax bill. Here’s how to deduct stock losses from your taxes and what to watch out for. The IRS allows you to deduct from your taxable income a capital loss, for example, from a stock or other investment that has lost money. Here are the ground rules: An investment loss has to be realized. In other words, you need to have sold your stock to claim a deduction. You can’t simply write off losses because the stock is worth less than when you bought it. You can deduct your loss against capital gains. Any taxable capital gain – an investment gain – realized in that tax year can be offset with a capital loss from that year or one carried forward from a prior year. If your losses exceed your gains, you have a net loss. Your net losses offset ordinary income. No capital gains? Your claimed capital losses will come off your taxable income, reducing your tax bill. Your maximum net capital loss in any tax year is $3,000. The IRS limits your net loss to $3,000 (for individuals and married filing jointly) or $1,500 (for married filing separately). You can reduce any amount of taxable capital gains as long as you have gross losses to offset them. For example, if you have a $20,000 loss and a $16,000 gain, you can claim the maximum deduction of $3,000 on this year’s taxes, and the remaining $1,000 loss in a future year. Again, for any year the maximum allowed net loss is $3,000. The last day to realize a loss for the current calendar year is the final trading day of the year. That day might be December 31, but it may be earlier, depending on the calendar. You can enter any stock gains and losses on Schedule D of your annual tax return, and the worksheet will help you figure out your net gain or loss. You may want to consult with a tax professional if your situation is complicated. It’s also important to know that short-term losses offset short-term gains first, while long-term losses offset long-term gains first. However, once losses in one category exceed the same type, you can then use them to offset gains in the other category. Short-term gains and losses are for assets held less than one year, while long-term gains and losses are for assets held longer than a year.                                  ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow But a familiar foe is threatening to put a damper on this risk-on vibe: soaring bond yields. Investors are dialing back wagers on how aggressively the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates after economists warned that Trump’s policy proposals — from deregulation to tax cuts — could balloon the deficit and reignite inflation. Treasuries are already reacting, with yields on the 2-, 5-, 10-year and 30-year notes jumping to the highest since July. Leading up to Election Day, Wall Street strategists emphasized that bond yields would set the trajectory for US equities, contending that if rates move higher equities could pull back. “The Red Sweep narrative is clearly driving up market expectations for nominal growth, which is bullish for earnings but also puts upward pressure on yields,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC. “This sets up a tug-of-war between earnings and rates.” Traders should get a bit more clarity on the path from here after the Fed’s interest-rate decision on Thursday followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Record Day For now, however, equity investors seem unfazed. The S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq 100 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average all set new intraday highs Wednesday. And the small-cap Russell 2000 Index, which houses some of the riskiest stocks in the market, jumped more than 5% for its best day in a year, inching closer to its first record since 2021. “I am not surprised that for the moment, equities are ignoring the spike in interest rates, perhaps believing that deregulation and the potential for lower corporate tax rates is a bigger deal,” said Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler & Co. That said, not everyone in the stock market is celebrating. Of the S&P 500’s 11 major sectors, three are in the red, with real estate falling around 3.2% as rising interest rates mean higher mortgage rates. And although the index is up 2.4%, more than 160 of its stocks are down. At the New York Stock Exchange, 36% of the stocks were trading lower as of 1:15 p.m. in New York. “Stocks, currencies, and commodities are all following the playbook from 2016, but 2024 is not 2016,” said Marko Papic, chief strategist at BCA Research. “In 2016, stocks needed more growth and inflation. It is not clear that’s what we need today in a world of elevated bond yields. So I do believe rising yields will negatively impact stocks.”             ",

He will return the White House to Republican hands in January, when the Senate will also flip to the GOP. The race to control the House — the last chance for divided government in Washington — remained up in the air as of press time. Fashion stocks joined in some of the rally. The gainers included Capri Holdings up 7.2 percent to $22; Signet Jewelers, 6.1 percent to $97.30; Macy’s Inc., 5.2 percent to $16.09 and Amazon.com Inc., 3.8 percent to $207.09. But the wider industry was more muted. Designers often have more liberal social leanings and were very much on Team Kamala, donating to her campaign and rallying in New York with First Lady Jill Biden to get out the vote. Harris conceded the election and addressed supporters at her alma mater, Howard University, on Wednesday afternoon, saying that she had congratulated Trump on his win and underscoring the importance of a peaceful transfer of power. “While I conceded this election, I don’t concede the fight that fueled this campaign,” she said. “The fight for freedom, for opportunity, fairness and the dignity of all people.” The fashion industry remained cautious of Trump 2.0 with lobbying groups both reaching out to cooperate with the incoming administration and stressing the need to avoid any more costly and chaotic trade wars. While avoiding any new tariffs is at the top of the import-heavy fashion industry’s agenda, broader forces are at work and Trump’s second election moves America into a new and uncertain time. The campaign was bitter, filled with dark rhetoric and an assisination attempt with Trump altogether promising a much more comprehensive reordering of the federal government than he accomplished in his first term. That will ripple across geo-political and business landscape — from how antitrust watchdogs regulate corporate takeovers to whether the U.S. continues to support Ukraine in the face of a Russian assault. While Trump’s supporters rejoiced at the change, many others braced for what comes next. “Most of the world with very few exceptions are more or less in shock at the moment,” said Martin Lindstrom, a consultant who specializes in business transformation and branding.

Markets will be hoping for additional support given the trade challenges likely to be posed by Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Among energy products, coal imports maintained their record-setting pace, staying above 45 million tons for a fourth consecutive month in October as China continues to build stockpiles and prepare for demand spikes over the colder season. Shipments of both coal and natural gas have surged 14% over the year to date. Crude oil was an outlier after refining activity weakened, with purchases dropping 8.7% from the year before to 44.7 million tons. Imports over the first 10 months have fallen 3.4% due to a prolonged slump in consumer spending, weaker demand from construction sites and the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. Iron ore imports remained above 100 million tons for a fourth month, despite China’s property crisis and a slide in steel production, as traders stockpiled more of the feedstock. Steel exports, a key channel for soaking up domestic oversupply, surged above 11 million tons for the first time in nine years. Analysts said Trump’s election could lift overseas sales further in the period before he takes office if exporters are worried about global trade relations taking a turn for the worse. Copper imports climbed above 500,000 tons for the first time since May to meet demand over the peak autumn season. Shipments of concentrate to feed China’s smelting expansion were flat, reflecting tight supply from overseas mines. Soybean imports were well ahead of last year, but dropped from the highs of the previous two months as buyers slowed purchases due to strong inventories and sluggish demand.

        "body": "Prime Shrimp, recognised for its innovative approach to increasing shrimp consumption, has announced its expansion into select Whole Foods Market locations throughout the US. The expansion places four of Prime Shrimp's most sought-after flavours - Signature, Lemon & Cracked Pepper, Garlic Herb Butter and New Orleans-Style BBQ - in more than 200 stores across the northeast, north-Atlantic, mid-Atlantic, south and southwest regions of the country. Prime Shrimp's Whole Foods Market account manager Tom Welles said: “Expanding Prime Shrimp’s availability in the US by launching with Whole Foods Market marks the achievement of a long-held aspiration for our brand. Whole Foods Market’s values resonate with our mission to offer better, more sustainable nourishment that fits seamlessly into the lives of the modern, conscious consumer. “Given the growing demand for our products in the US, Whole Foods Market is the ideal collaborator to broaden our reach and make Prime Shrimp’s easy-to-cook shrimp offering more accessible.” The company's flagship offering is a responsibly farmed shrimp that comes ready to cook in a vacuum-packed pouch. This product is designed to alleviate common cooking hassles such as odour, preparation time, messiness and handling raw seafood. Prime Shrimp's unique cook-in-pouch method aims to simplify seafood preparation, positioning shrimp as a regular protein choice for consumers. The brand views its responsibly farmed shrimp as a nutritious alternative to traditional proteins such as chicken, beef and pork. Sourced from responsible aquaculture practices in Ecuador, Prime Shrimp complies with Whole Foods Market’s strict responsibly farmed seafood standards which exclude the use of certain chemicals typically employed in shrimp farming and processing. Headquartered in New Orleans, Prime Shrimp is dedicated to creating frozen shrimp products in sauced and seasoned varieties. \"Prime Shrimp expands retail presence to Whole Foods Market in US\" was originally created and published by Verdict Food Service, a GlobalData owned brand.

Major U.S. indexes surged at midday Wednesday with former President Donald Trump set to return to the White House. The Dow jumped over 3%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq added 2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury also climbed. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the social media company majority owned by Trump, jumped.

        "body": "By Kevin Buckland TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific equity markets traded higher on Thursday, buoyed by a record rise for U.S. shares overnight, as investors mulled the implications of a Donald Trump presidency, while also eyeing policy decisions from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks later in the day. U.S. stock futures pointed higher after all three major Wall Street indexes surged to all-time peaks on Wednesday on the possibility for a Republican sweep that could quickly usher in big fiscal spending. U.S. Treasury yields soared on the risk of higher deficits, helping lift the dollar to its biggest one-day gain in more than two years on Wednesday, although the currency eased back slightly on Thursday. The euro was under additional pressure after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked his Finance Minister Christian Lindner, causing the ruling three-party coalition to collapse and setting the stage for a snap election early next year. German DAX futures added 0.36%, following a 1.1% slide on Wednesday. Pan-European STOXX 50 futures pointed 0.4% higher, and Britain's FTSE futures added 0.38%. Asian stocks started the day broadly mixed, with Japanese shares lifted by a weaker yen, while Australia's benchmark was weighed down by gold stocks after bullion slumped against a strengthening dollar. However, markets were higher around the region as of 0634 GMT, with Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei 225 the only major stock index to post losses, even as the broader Topix index gained 1%. Elevated bond yields buoyed shares of Japanese banks and insurers, but weighed on tech names and other growth stocks. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield at 4.4255%, hovered close to Wednesday's four-month peak of 4.4790%, while 10-year Japanese government bond yields rose above 1% for the first time in three months. Analysts also pointed to profit taking after the Nikkei's 2.6% surge on Wednesday. \"In this highly volatile period, you have to be very selective in Japan,\" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale, describing the Nikkei as overextended. \"When we have the Nikkei at this level, I feel very uncomfortable.\" Australia's equity benchmark gained 0.3%, while Taiwan's benchmark climbed 0.8%. South Korea's Kospi closed slightly higher, snapping a two-day decline. Chinese markets, which lost ground on Wednesday due to the likelihood of higher tariffs under another Trump presidency, rebounded in the latest session. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.5% and mainland blue chips added 2.6%.                      ",

That's exactly what she did this week. This strategy enables her to lock in gains and rebalance her portfolios. Investors and analysts have mixed views on Cathie Wood. Supporters see her as a visionary in tech investing, while critics argue she’s an average fund manager. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸 Known among followers as “Mama Cathie,” Wood drew significant attention with a stellar 153% return in 2020, bolstered by the clear, accessible discussions of her strategy across media platforms. However, her longer-term performance isn’t so hot. ARK Invest's flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) , with $5.8 billion under management, has returned -8% year-to-date, with an annualized three-year return of -26.5% and a five-year return of positive 1.8%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gained 22.6% this year, with an annualized three-year return of 8.9% and a five-year return of 15.3%. PATRICK T. FALLON/Getty Images Wood’s investment strategy is simple: Ark ETFs typically buy shares in emerging, high-tech companies across fields like artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. Wood believes companies in these areas will revolutionize industries, though the stocks are notoriously volatile, leading to substantial swings in the Ark funds’ values. Morningstar, however, is openly skeptical of Wood’s approach and the ARK Innovation ETF. Investing in young, minimally profitable companies “demands forecasting talent, which ARK Investment Management lacks,” wrote Morningstar analyst Robby Greengold. “Results range from tremendous to horrendous.” Related: Cathie Wood's net worth: The Ark Invest CEO's wealth & income Wood defended herself in a July 2024 posting on Ark’s website. She acknowledged that “the macro environment and some stock picks have challenged our recent performance” but affirmed her “commitment to investing in disruptive innovation.” According to Wood, many of Ark’s holdings are in “rare, deep value territory,” and she expects her innovation-focused funds to benefit “disproportionately, as they did in the fourth quarter of 2023 and during the coronavirus crisis.” Some investors appear to share Morningstar’s doubts. Over the past year, ARK Innovation ETF saw a net outflow of $2.65 billion, data from ETF research firm VettaFi show. From Oct. 30 to Nov. 5, Ark Funds sold 1,304,856 shares of Palantir (PLTR) over five consecutive days surrounding the data-analytics company's Q3 earnings announcement.              ",

Nvidia's rise follows a tech rally post-Donald Trump's election win, with the Nasdaq 100 up nearly 3%. Analysts predict Nvidia's valuation could soon surpass $4 trillion amid ongoing AI market growth. Nvidia stock soared as much as 5% on Wednesday to hit a record intra-day high of $146.47. The gains catapulted Nvidia's market valuation to $3.58 trillion, cementing its position as the largest company in the world after it closed ahead of Apple on Tuesday. It's the first time Nvidia has occupied the top spot on the list of most valuable companies since late October. The stock surge came amid a broader rally for the tech sector following Donald Trump's election victory, with the Nasdaq 100 rising nearly 3%. The gains in Nvidia shares on Wednesday significantly outpaced the gains in Apple stock, which was up by just 0.12% at 3:05 p.m. ET. Apple is now the world's second-largest company, worth about $3.38 trillion, or about $200 billion less than Nvidia. The next largest company is Microsoft, which was worth $3.12 trillion on Wednesday. In the two years since ChatGPT's debut, shares of Nvidia, which supplies the tech sector with AI-enabling GPU chips, have added nearly $3.2 trillion to their market valuation. The stock has soared about 800%. Wall Street believes the gains can continue, with some analysts expecting the stock to soon top a $4 trillion valuation. Bank of America analysts raised their Nvidia price target to $190 last week, citing strong upside and a \"generational opportunity\" as it grows its lead in the AI space. Another recent milestone for Nvidia is its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with the company set to replace Intel on Friday. Nvidia will report third-quarter earnings results after the market close on November 20. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

        "body": "The election of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States is the latest geopolitical event investors have faced in recent years, alongside others such as the attempted assassination of Trump earlier this year, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. It’s well-known that events like these can have an impact on financial markets, but how and why? Here’s how geopolitical events impact the stock market and how investors can protect themselves from the risks. Geopolitical events, such as elections, wars, assassinations and terrorist attacks, can significantly impact stock market performance across various sectors. This influence typically stems from the uncertainty these events introduce into the global economic environment. For instance, elections can generate market volatility due to uncertainties about future government policies that could influence economic growth. All three major indexes jumped sharply following Trump’s election this week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a new record high, Treasury yields spiked, bond prices fell and the dollar rose. Stocks in general surged in response to the election results. Elections have a particular way of spurring or slowing stock market activity as candidates’ proposals drive investor and consumer expectations about economic growth. Similarly, geopolitical tensions and disputes can disrupt international relations and economic partnerships, leading to market uncertainty and volatility. The stock market’s initial response to these events is often to decline, as investors deal with fear and work to understand how an event may impact future economic growth. Over time, the impact of geopolitical events is typically limited, with other variables such as corporate earnings growth and the level of interest rates playing a larger role in determining market returns. It’s also worth noting that geopolitical events are just one variable that may impact the stock market on a given day. At any given time, market participants are weighing many different variables, so it’s not always clear how much of a market move was due to a specific geopolitical event. Historical examples demonstrate that many geopolitical events have significant short-term impacts on the stock market, while their long-term effects vary based on the nature and severity of the event. Here’s how the S&P 500 performed after notable events of the past century. Geopolitical event Date One day Total drawdown Bottom Recovery Pearl Harbor attack 12/7/1941 -3.8% -19.8% 143 days 307 days JFK assassination 11/22/1963 -2.8% -2.8% 1 day 1 day Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait 8/2/1990 -1.1% -16.9% 71 days 189 days Sept. 11 attacks 9/11/2001 -4.9% -11.6% 11 days 31 days London bombing 7/5/2005 0.9% 0.0% 1 day 4 days Boston Marathon bombing 4/15/2013 -2.3% -3.0% 4 days 15 days Russia-Ukraine War 2/17/2022 -2.1% -6.8% 13 days 23 days Israel-Hamas War 10/9/2023 0.3% -4.5% 14 days 19 days You’ll notice that the initial stock market response is often sharply lower when an unexpected geopolitical event occurs. Sometimes the decline can last for a few days or weeks as the market digests the risks. However, over the long term, the stock market tends to recover and often reaches new highs in the years after the event.         ",

As Trump’s odds surged on so-called prediction markets near the end of the race, platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket gained attention for diverging sharply from traditional polls, which suggested a much closer race. Talking with the outlet, a Princeton neuroscience professor credited the markets’ comparative accuracy to their ability to “measure crowd wisdom where no hard data is available.” Backers in Kalshi plainly saw what was coming. As TechCrunch reported last week, its investors loaned the outfit tens of millions of dollars in short-term loans to pay its customers. Their individual winnings may pale in comparison to a Polymarket bettor known as the \"Polymarket whale.\" As Reuters notes, the French former trader made $40 million worth of Trump-related bets on the site. If Trump also wins the popular vote, the \"whale\" will reportedly walk away with $80 million. ",

(NASDAQ:NVAX) and the U.K. Health Security Agency, representing the U.K. Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, signed a Termination and Settlement Agreement and an amendment to resolve disputes over their updated COVID-19 vaccine supply contract from July 1, 2022. As per the SEC filing, the agreement releases both parties from any claims related to that prior contract. As part of the settlement, Novavax and the U.K. Health Security Agency agreed to end the supply contract and settle disputed upfront payments Novavax previously received. Under the terms, Novavax will refund $123.8 million to the U.K. agency in quarterly payments of $10.3 million over three years, with the final payment due by June 30, 2027. This amount includes $11.3 million in interest, which can be avoided if Novavax pays ahead of schedule. According to the amendment, the first quarterly payment is due on November 30, 2024. The two parties initially entered into a COVID-19 vaccine supply deal in 2020, and the United Kingdom government agreed to purchase 60 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine. The company's protein-based adjuvanted shot NVX-CoV2373 was renamed Nuvaxovid after being authorized by the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in 2022. Recently, the FDA has placed a clinical hold on Novavax's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for its COVID-19-influenza combination (CIC) and stand-alone influenza vaccine candidates. The clinical hold is due to a spontaneous report of a serious adverse event (SAE) of motor neuropathy in a single CIC Phase 2 trial participant outside the U.S. who received the vaccine in January 2023. Earlier in October, the European Commission approved Novavax's updated 2024-2025 Nuvaxovid COVID-19 Vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) (NVX-CoV2705), dispersion for injection, for use in individuals aged 12 and older to prevent COVID-19 in the European Union.

Kostin forecasts EPS growth of 11% in 2025 and 7% in 2026, \"although those estimates may change as the new administration's policy agenda comes into clarity.\" The strategist also added, \"The prospect of trade conflict poses downside risk to these estimates, while the potential for changing regulatory and corporate tax policy pose upside risks.\" On Wednesday the S&P 500 surged 2.5% to hover above 5,900 at new record highs. President Biden called President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on his victory and extended an invitation to the White House, according to the White House press pool. Biden will also address the nation on Thursday to talk about the election results and a transition. Vice President Kamala Harris also called Trump on Wednesday to concede and congratulate him. Harris is set to speak at 4 p.m. ET at Howard University. The Yahoo News live blog has more coverage and up-to-date info. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday. And many economists are still projecting another cut in December is likely on the table as well. But Donald Trump's election win is shifting how economists are viewing the path forward for the Fed come 2025. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul has reported: Trump's main campaign promises — a new wave of tariffs and a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants — could put new upward pressure on prices, many economists say. That sentiment played out in markets and Wall Street's Fed forecasts on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) spiked as much as 17 basis points to hit 4.46%. The move extended a recent surge in Treasurys as economic growth data has largely come in better than expected since the Fed slashed rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18. Markets have now moved from seeing nearly eight cuts when the Fed first cut rates back in September to now pricing in about four cuts through the end of next year. Wells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson had projected seven interest rate cuts from the Fed over the next year. But Bryson wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that there are now clear risks to their forecast. \"The FOMC may not want to ease policy by that much if new tax cuts and tariffs cause inflation to shoot higher over the next couple of years,\" Bryson wrote. \"Thus, we think the risks to our fed funds rate forecast are skewed to the upside (i.e., less easing next year than we currently project).\" Given Wednesday's Fed decision feels widely anticipated, any commentary on how Trump policies could impact the Fed's path forward will be sure to grab investor attention during Fed chair Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. Vice President Kamala Harris called former President Donald Trump to concede the presidential race, a senior campaign aide said. Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris's campaign manager, said Harris told Trump she would work with President Joe Biden to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. Harris also told Trump that she \"hopes he will be a president for all Americans.\" Harris will address the nation later today in a speech at Howard University as the Democratic Party reels from its second stunning defeat to the billionaire. Trump has swung four states he lost in 2020 in his path back to the White House: Georgia and the \"blue wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed above 5,900 for the first time ever on Wednesday as investors went risk-on following Donald Trump's White House victory.

Financials (XLF) led the market gains with JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) hitting new records. On the tech side, chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) also soared more than 4% to touch new highs. Nvidia stock (NVDA) touched a record on Wednesday, up 4% as the major averages soared following Donald Trump's presidential victory.

Tesla (TSLA) shares soared 14% in afternoon trading as Wall Street analysts weighed in on how the electric vehicle giant could benefit from Donald Trump's presidential victory. \"TSLA and CEO Elon Musk are perhaps the biggest winners from the election result, and we believe Trump's victory will help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology,\" wrote Garrett Nelson, vice president and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. The analyst upgraded Tesla to Buy from Hold, lifting his 12-month price target on the stock from $110 to $375 per share. Musk was pivotal in helping elect Trump, spending more than $130 million on Trump and down-ballot Republicans. Donald Trump's election win shaped the stock market action early Wednesday, with a broad \"Trump trade\" pushing stocks, crypto, and other themes higher in a broad rally. \"The market initially is focused on all the potential positives of a Trump candidacy as far as lower regulations, lower taxes,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. Investor support for the financial sector was a standout on Wednesday. The SPDR Financials Sector ETF (XLF), which is comprised of some of the largest banks in the country, rose more than 4% for its best day in two years. Big banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS) were all up between 7% and 11%. Meanwhile, companies with pending acquisitions caught bids, as seen by the more than 17% rise in Discover Financials (DFS) stock, which is currently in agreement to be acquired by Capital One (COF).

Shares of the AI server maker, which is a customer of Nvidia (NVDA), tumbled 24% to trade above $20 midday. The drop extends Tuesday's losses after Super Micro earnings missed estimates. The company also said it couldn't predict when it would file its delayed 10-K report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The stock, which thrived earlier this year thanks to the artificial intelligence boom, has been under pressure since a report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research in August revealed alleged accounting violations at the company. Shares tanked further when the Wall Street Journal reported in September that the company was being investigated by the Department of Justice. They plunged again on Oct. 30 when Super Micro's accounting firm Ernst & Young, which was conducting its audit, resigned. Super Micro is now at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq (^IXIC). Major US-listed Chinese stocks sank after a decisive US election win for Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump, who has promised to impose a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. Shares of US-listed Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) fell as much as 4.5% while JD.com (JD) dropped as much as 7.7%, Bilibili (BILI) stock fell up to 7.8%, Baidu (BIDU) sank as much as 2.9%, and PDD Holdings (PDD) tumbled up to 5.1%. The stocks pared losses as the morning continued. Trump's trade plan would implement tariffs at levels unseen since the Great Depression, which would raise basic costs for US households and hit GDP growth. Read the full story here. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring mortgage rates down. It may not necessarily work out that way. \"Trump’s fiscal policies can be expected to lead to rising and more unpredictable mortgage rates through the end of this year and into 2025,\" Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant wrote in an email Wednesday. \"Signals of higher mortgage rates are already out there in the form of rising yields on the 10-year Treasury this morning.\" The yield on the 10-year Treasury spiked early Wednesday to 4.45%. Mortgage rates usually move in conjunction with the 10-year yield as lenders determine their daily rates with movements in the bond market. Sturtevant added, \"Bond yields are rising because investors expect Trump’s proposed fiscal policies to widen the federal deficit and reverse progress on inflation.\" According to a Wall Street Journal survey conducted in early October, most economists predicted inflation, interest rates and deficits would be higher in a Trump administration versus a Kamala Harris administration. Trump's victory comes as the housing market has remained out of reach for many Americans over the past few years, driven by record-high home prices, elevated mortgage rates, and an undersupply of homes. Oil slid as much as 2% on Wednesday before flipping into green territory as the US dollar rose and traders weighed what Donald Trump's presidential victory means for demand and supply going forward. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered around $72 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $75 per barrel. Earlier in the session, the US Dollar Index saw its biggest jump since 2016. Analysts highlighted Trump's promise to end the Ukraine-Russia war and his counsel to Israel to wind down the Gaza conflict quickly. \"Crude futures being pressured by the 'Trump Trade' this morning as a sharply higher US Dollar Index and the prospects of deescalation in both the Middle East and Ukraine is taking the Geopolitical fear factor out of crude,\" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote on Wednesday morning. The possibility of more tariffs also weighed on prices earlier in the session. \"Tariffs may ultimately impact trade between the USA and China, negatively affecting the Chinese economy and the growth in oil demand,\" Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. In early trading action, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped about 2.8%, or more than 1,200 points, to lead the gains. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up roughly 1.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 1.8%. Meanwhile, the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT), which includes some regional banks, soared more than 4.2% at the open. The small-cap index was partially driven by a rally in banks. Trump's policy proposals have been viewed by some experts as more positive for the financials sector, spurring a massive rally in regional banks before the open on Wednesday. The S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) was up more than 10%. Amid a broad market rally Wednesday morning, bank stocks were among the best performers. Investors see Donald Trump's win in the presidential race as ushering in a \"new era\" for regulating the nation's biggest financial institutions. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith notes: \"Big banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are all up between 7% and 11% in premarket trading Wednesday morning.\" Bank stocks have been strong performers for much of this year, with most of the large money center banks seeing their shares outperform the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2024. As David reports, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said in a note early Wednesday that Trump's win \"should aid all banks.\" Mayo added that the win ushers in a \"new era after 15 years of harsher regulation\" following the financial crisis. Read more from David on what could be one of the most impactful Trump trades for investors and consumers alike during the next administration. Here's a look at the big economic and market themes happening today as Wall Street digests Donald Trump's rise back to the White House. Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, (the week ended Nov. 1); S&P Global US services PMI, (October final); S&P Global US composite PMI, (October final) Earnings: Arm Holdings (ARM), AMC (AMC), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Celsius Holdings (CELH), CVS (CVS), Elf (ELF), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: As Trump wins, here's what's next on 2 key economic issues Bitcoin hits record as pro-crypto Trump wins presidency again Tesla shares pop DJT stock rockets higher Oil tumbles as Trump trades boost the dollar Gold falls amid Trump's decisive win Dollar hits 1-year high Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged to a fresh record high overnight as Donald Trump, the candidate viewed as the most pro-cryptocurrency, emerged as the president-elect. The world's largest cryptocurrency surged above $74,000 per coin for the first time ever late Tuesday night. But it's not just actual crypto coins moving higher. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which holds a significant amount of bitcoin on its balance sheet, rose more than 11% in premarket trade. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) also gained more than 12%, while Robinhood (HOOD), which offers cryptocurrency trading on its platform, popped almost 10%. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 12% in premarket trading on Wednesday morning as investors digested Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had been a heavy supporter of Trump's campaign. Trump referenced Musk during his speech early Wednesday morning, calling him a \"super genius.\" \"We have to protect our geniuses,\" Trump said. \"We don't have that many of them.\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives pointed out that Trump could roll back the current electric vehicle tax incentives in place and be \"an overall negative for the EV industry.\" But given Tesla's potential competitive advantage in the EV space, this could be a \"huge positive\" for Tesla. \"Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry, and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years,\" Ives wrote in a Wednesday morning note. Nio's (NIO) stock fell 6% before the bell, while BYD (BYDDY) shares fell 3.8% in Hong Kong. Ives added that a Trump win could also fast-track Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) initiatives. \"We believe a Trump win could add $40-$50 per share to Tesla's stock and exceed $1 trillion in market cap if autonomous/FSD is accelerated starting in 2025 and a tailwind for Cybercab,\" Ives wrote.

In June, the bloc shared preliminary findings with the company, warning that developers should be free to inform users of alternative purchasing routes. However, Apple has persisted in devising new fees in a bid to work around DMA requirements to let developers avoid its usual App Store cut. Bloomberg's report says the EU decision on the case is still being drafted but could land later this month. It does not specify the size of the fine but the DMA allows for penalties of up to 10% of global annual turnover so it could translate into tens of billions of dollars given Apple's revenue.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors bracing for President Donald Trump 2.0 know two things: The new administration will seek to ram through his “Make America Great Again” agenda, and the ensuing bill could be sky-high. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The Republican victor is poised to unleash a fresh round of policies — tariffs, tax cuts, immigration crackdowns — to both boost economic growth and shield the nation from an influx of low-cost, overseas goods and workers. While Trump’s first term featured similar policies and coincided with a boom in corporate profits, these measures, implemented now, threaten to rekindle an inflation spiral that took years to quell in the aftermath of the pandemic. Markets greeted Trump’s win with both optimism and trepidation. Stocks surged in early Wednesday trading with futures on S&P 500 climbing more than 2% on his business-friendly agenda including deregulation and activist industrial policy. No such cheer was evident in fixed income as 10-year Treasury yields spiked toward 4.5% amid anticipation that a swelling deficit under Trump will force the government to pay up for borrowing. Higher yields could exert pressure on the risk-taking rally, by hurting interest-rate sensitive stocks and challenging new funding efforts among corporate issuers and consumers. The decade-long gain for stocks is already 35% above the norm, and risk premiums for corporate bonds are at epic lows — making the margin for error on the economy decidedly narrow. “Stocks have the wind at their back for now, but equities will be keeping a close eye on yields,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of market intelligence firm Vital Knowledge, who previously spent more than a decade at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “And if the Treasury slump continues, that will short circuit the Trump equity celebration.” Then there’s a growing risk of protectionism. According to JPMorgan, boosting tariffs on China imports to 60% alone would hurt S&P 500 profits by as much as $15 a share, an amount that could wipe off almost half of 2025’s income gains. A maximal version of the tariffs plan, with the across-the-board rate at 20%, could lower US GDP by 0.8% and boost price pressures notably in the years ahead if China alone retaliates, Bloomberg Economics projects. “A material increase in tariffs would represent the most significant departure in policy from the current administration and potentially the largest source of volatility,” JPMorgan strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note before the election result. “The current macro backdrop is much different versus eight years ago, when the business cycle was in mid-cycle, labor market was less tight, inflation was not on the Fed’s radar, and pro-growth 1.0 policies were easier to implement and more impactful to the bottom-line.”                      ",

        "body": "Politicians are often criticized for their promises in an election campaign never making it into legislation. In the case of President-Elect Donald Trump's return to the White House, the market is somewhat banking on it. Trump's economic policies were a hit with voters but drew more mixed reactions from analysts and economists. The winning candidate's proposals for immigration and tariffs, in particular, prompted questions about how they would work in practice. But experts now know that former President Donald Trump will be back in the Oval Office, as opposed to his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. In the early hours of this morning, Trump was declared victor of the 2024 race, winning 277 of the 270 seats needed to clinch the role of commander-in-chief. Markets were turbulent this morning as many analysts had held out on hitching their wagon to one candidate or the other. As economists firmed up their view on another Trump administration, one thing became clear: They're somewhat certain that the sharpest points of Trump's mandate will not come to fruition. Ahead of the election being called in Trump's favor, UBS's chief economist Paul Donovan wrote in an audio note obtained by Fortune: \"Markets appear to assume that the campaign rhetoric (specifically around deportations and tariffs) will not fully translate into policy. \"The potential for market moves therefore depends ... on any emerging signals about how dramatic those policies might turn out to be.\" Trump's tariff plans include a 10% tax on all goods imported to the U.S. and a steep 60% duty on imports from China. The politician has made it clear he wants to enforce the tax even on some of America's greatest trade and political allies, such as Europe, saying the nations would have to pay a \"big price.\" Trump has also said his administration will undertake \"the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\" In an interview with Time magazine, Trump said he plans to remove upwards of 11 million people by building migrant detention camps and deploying the U.S. military at the border and throughout the country. As European markets woke up to the news of Trump's victory, analysts were keen to frame the spectrum of outcomes if the politician's proposals came to fruition. Analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note seen by Fortune that \"renewed trade tensions [between the U.S. and Europe] are likely to weigh materially on growth.\" Assuming that European nations would match Trump's 10% tariff with an equal one of their own, the economists found the GDP of the Euro area would fall 1%: 0.7% in the U.K., 1.1% in Germany, 1.1% in Sweden and 1% in Switzerland.

        "body": "By Stine Jacobsen COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Shares in European clean energy groups plummeted on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, as investors fretted over a potential dismantling of U.S. support for renewables and climate policy. Trump had vowed to scrap offshore wind projects through an executive order on his first day in office and to roll back climate regulations implemented under President Joe Biden. That includes leaving the Paris Agreement, under which countries pledge to limit global warming, and potentially undoing Biden's flagship Inflation Reduction Act, which provides massive subsidies and incentives to clean energy technologies. The world's largest offshore wind developer Orsted fell as much as 14% while wind turbine makers Vestas and Nordex traded down around 11% and 7.6%, respectively. \"The key message is that uncertainty is back,\" Alphavalue analyst Pierre-Alexandre Ramondenc told Reuters. The U.S. renewables market is a key growth sector for several European utility companies, including Portugal's EDP Renovaveis, Orsted, and Germany's top power producer RWE, according to Deutsche Bank analysts. \"A full repeal of the IRA would depend on Congress, although significant changes might be possible,\" Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to clients. While projects where construction had begun were likely to go ahead, Trump's policies could delay others such as offshore wind projects not due online until 2029 or later, the bank added. Despite the uncertainty, Vestas and Orsted had said on Tuesday that they expected demand for green energy in the U.S. would continue to grow regardless of who won the presidency. Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM in Milan, said he viewed Orsted's share price drop as an \"overreaction\", adding he took advantage of it to round up his position in the stock. \"Thinking that the trend toward green energy transition is completely over seems irrational,\" he said. Nordex also remained optimistic about the U.S. onshore wind market but acknowledged potential delays in customer decisions due to uncertainty, a spokesperson told Reuters on Wednesday. Shares in RWE, which also has wind assets, fell 6.6%, while EDP Renovaveis, traded 11% lower. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF fell 6% to its lowest since mid-2020. Vestas, Orsted and EDP were the biggest decliners on the pan-European STOXX 600 index. EDP declined to comment while RWE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "body": "(Reuters) - As Donald Trump was projected to win the White House, according to Edison Research, the U.S. dollar and stock market are seen as winners, but a Republican presidency could weigh on bonds, emerging markets, clean energy and sustainable investing. Here's how: CURRENCIES A Trump presidency is seen strengthening the U.S. dollar, with investors expecting his policies to lead to higher inflation and growth than would have been the case under Democrat Kamala Harris. That will mean the Federal Reserve would need to keep rates high to prevent the economy from overheating, which in turn would be bullish for the dollar. At the same time, Trump's plans to impose tariffs on trade, force European allies to pay more for defense and suspicion of multilateral institutions are likely to depress growth elsewhere in the world, boosting the dollar's allure. Citi analysts expect the dollar to rally 3% after a Trump win. Analysts expect a sharp fall in the euro, possibly below the key $1 level, if tariffs and domestic tax cuts follow. They also expect China's yuan to slide further, as in 2018-2020 when it depreciated swiftly. Higher dollar yields will also mean a return of carry-trades, with currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc already heavily sold in the run-up to the election. Yet the Swiss franc will find support, analysts say, thanks to the country's higher-value exports shielding it from tariffs and the currency's tendency to outperform during periods of higher inflation. With a Trump administration expected to take a softer line on cryptocurrency regulation, bitcoin is another potential winner. The world's largest cryptocurrency rose to an all-time high on Wednesday. STOCKS Trump's promise of less regulation and lower taxes for big corporations, more oil production and tough immigration policy point to stronger growth and inflation, viewed as positive for equities. Sectors such as banks, technology, defense and fossil fuels are likely to benefit. His plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21% would raise S&P 500 earnings by about 4%, Goldman Sachs estimates. Even so, it is not yet clear how much of Trump's tax cut plan will make it through Congress. At the same time, his protectionist policies and tough stance on China would raise costs, reduce profitability and hurt multinational companies. Outside the United States, a strong dollar, rising U.S. rates and trade tensions will mean defensive sectors will do better and multinational companies with exposure to U.S. markets will take a hit.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Trump’s US election victory lifted stocks and risk assets, in particular, Wednesday on bets the Republican will enact policies that are pro-business. Among those trades seen getting a boost from Trump’s administration are exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin and industrial stocks. Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto based on market value, hit a record Tuesday night. Throughout October, investors piled $4.6 billion into the iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker IBIT), the ETF’s second-best month on record since launching at the beginning of 2024, while adding to other Bitcoin-tracking ETFs. The funds are all up roughly 6.5% Wednesday. “Since President Trump’s election is seen as bullish for the cryptocurrency asset class, this should be something that feeds on itself,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. “Whenever any asset pushes to a new all-time high on key new-news, it usually leads to a significant breakout.” A basket of industrials ETFs drew about $2 billion in October — the best month of inflows since March 2021, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Although there’s been some outflows this month, traders who held onto their positions are reaping the benefits: the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (ticker XLI), the biggest fund of the group, is up roughly 3.5%. Industrial stocks are seen benefiting from Trump’s pro-domestic manufacturing policies. To be sure, a benign economy and steady earnings have buoyed risk assets but make no mistake: the imprint of the Trump Trade has been visible in the underbelly of ETF markets. Shorter-term bets are also paying off. Before the polls closed on Tuesday, traders plowed nearly $800 million into a BlackRock Inc. fund tracking high-yield bonds — one of the biggest daily buys all year for the ETF. Wednesday morning a high-yield index rose to the highest level since January 2022. There were, however, corners of the ETF market left untapped. Banks and consumer finance companies are likely to benefit from a lighter regulatory touch under a Trump presidency, but financials-focused ETFs saw relatively little inflows in October and net outflows the month prior.

Analysts mostly have neutral ratings on the software and hardware maker, but still believe the stock has the ability to rise in the coming months. However, JPMorgan analysts on Tuesday said a sluggish smartphone and PC market could slow Qualcomm's revenue growth in its next fiscal year.  Qualcomm (QCOM) will report its fourth quarter earnings after the market closes Wednesday, and analysts expect rising revenue and profits compared to the same time last year. However, they see revenue growth slowing over the next year amid slow smartphone and PC sales. Analysts are somewhat bullish on the hardware and software manufacturer's stock, with the 12 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha split between four \"buy,\" seven \"hold,\" and one \"sell\" rating. Qualcomm's average price target of $198.08 shows that analysts think the stock has room to rise in the coming months. In the fourth quarter, analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue will rise nearly 15% from the same time last year to $9.9 billion, with profits projected to rise over 70% to $2.58 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Qualcomm stock rose 3% Wednesday to $170.87, about 17% above where it started the year but below the June highs of over $220. In a note ahead of Qualcomm's earnings, JPMorgan analysts lowered their estimates for Qualcomm's revenue and profit performance in fiscal 2025.

        "body": "By Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - With Donald Trump heading back to the White House, Wall Street is anticipating the potential for lower taxes, deregulation and a U.S. president who is quick to sound off on everything from the stock market to the dollar. Trump made tariffs and tax cuts key elements of his pitch to voters, many of whom said the economy was the biggest issue of the election. Another important plank of his platform is expected to be deregulation in areas ranging from the banking industry to cryptocurrencies. The promise of those policies appears to have already stirred prices for some assets, including the dollar, shares of regional banks and the price of bitcoin. For a Trump administration, \"markets are basically thinking it's pro-growth, even if it comes with higher inflation and higher interest rates,\" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS Group. Edison Research projected on Wednesday that Trump had secured more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. While political developments can move markets, investors say they typically tend to take a back seat to macroeconomic forces and the health of corporate profits as well as global events. For example, the S&P 500 rose nearly 70% during Trump's first term as technology shares soared, even as his tariff policies sparked bouts of volatility. Meanwhile, the energy sector notched deep losses after global economies were paralyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, although his administration was friendly to fossil fuel development. HISTORY NOT A GUIDE? Trump’s election in 2016 sparked a so-called reflation trade, with investors piling into an array of assets such as copper futures and shares of construction companies on the belief that tax cuts and other stimulative policies would boost sluggish U.S. economic growth. But the economic landscape has changed, and some investors believe the moves of 2016 may not offer an accurate roadmap for how stocks, bonds and the dollar might trade in coming months. The U.S. economy grew by an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to just below 2% in 2016. And while months of restrictive monetary policy have helped tamp inflation down from four-decade highs hit in 2022, some investors worry tariffs or tax cuts could send consumer prices higher again. By contrast, sluggish inflation and growth were concerns for the Fed eight years ago. Signs of rebounding inflation could also cause a rethink of the Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory, with the central bank just beginning to ease monetary policy after hiking rates to bring inflation down from 40-year highs.

Analysts see more consolidation, increased commercial lending, and more dealmaking under a Trump presidency. US bank stocks rallied on Wednesday after Donald Trump cruised to victory in the presidential election, with markets eyeing a better environment for dealmaking and lending to drive stronger profits. Shares of the largest US banks soared in Wednesday's session. JPMorgan jumped 11%. Bank of America rose 6%. Share of Citi gained 9%, and Wells Fargo jumped 13%. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley climbed 12% and 13%, respectively. The SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund climbed 11%. Investors flocked to financial stocks as a popular \"Trump trade\" in the weeks leading up to the election, with allies of the president-elect stating that Trump planned to unravel many of the regulations imposed on the banking sector after the 2008 financial crisis. According to Gerard Cassidy, a large-cap bank analyst from RBC Capital Markets, Trump's victory is likely to see some top regulators ousted, including the heads of agencies like the Consumer Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. More banks could also consolidate in the coming years, assuming Trump's cabinet and advisors adopt a \"pro-business\" stance, Cassidy speculated. Commercial lending could also pick up, potentially causing bank revenue to beat expectations next year, he added. \"We've been very optimistic and bullish about the bank stocks all year, and last night's win by Trump continues that bullishness,\" Cassidy said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday morning. \"We're going to see a real change in anti-trust, and we're going to see a change in banking regulation as well, and that's going to be positive for the banks.\" Leading up to the election, analysts also said they saw a fresh wave of dealmaking under Trump amid a potentially looser anti-trust stance from his administration. That could result in increased advisory revenue for big banks and help drive up profits. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

The Dow jumped 1,300 points, or 3 percent, in early trading Wednesday on the news that Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States, has been elected as the country’s 47th president. That spike represented the first time since November 2022 that the Dow rose more than 1,000 points, with other indices—the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq—also showing increases. More from Sourcing Journal Former Biden Official Says President Will Issue De Minimis Proposal Before End of Year Trump Win 'Carries More Disruptive Risk' to Container Market Gildan CEO Glenn Chamandy Talks Tariffs in Q3 Earnings Call The Republican Party also succeeded in gaining majority control of the U.S. Senate. As for the House of Representatives, votes are still being tallied for nearly 60 races that will determine which party gets control. The expectation is that the GOP will eke out a narrow victory for control of the House. Below is a summary of what Wall Street thinks is coming ahead in 2025 and beyond. Presuming a Republican sweep, the expectation is continued growth, meaning that the dollar depreciation is likely to erode slowly. Higher tariffs would be on the agenda. While that would increase the costs of foreign goods for American consumers, the use of tariff revenues to lower domestic taxes should act as a fiscal stimulus that would also support the dollar. The prospect of higher tariffs could lead to outperformance of stocks with high domestic revenue and supply chain exposure. And the potential for lower corporate tax rates and other pro-growth policies should be beneficial to U.S. corporations. Goldman strategists expect that a divided Congress is expected to result in China-focused tariffs rather than a more expansive tariff package, which could require congressional support. And without congressional support, expect to see limited prospects for tax cuts or other major legislative changes. As for trade, that will likely be similar to a Republican sweep as the president has authority independent of Congress on many aspects of trade policy. Goldman’s chief U.S. equity strategist David J. Kostin said on Wednesday that continued “economic expansion coupled with an improvement in CEO confidence” suggests that M&A activity will increase in 2025. “The regulatory posture of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) Antitrust Division that during the past four years challenged many proposed business combinations will likely be more relaxed under the incoming administration,” Kostin concluded. One of those deals that met FTC roadblocks was the Tapestry Inc.’s $8.5 billion acquisition of Capri Holdings Ltd. The FTC succeeded last month in obtaining a preliminary injunction to block the deal.          ",

The S&P 500 rose Wednesday, lifted by the strength of credit-card issuers, Tesla (TSLA) and the industrial and energy sectors in the first trading session after Election Day. Credit card companies and banks outperformed the index, with stock for Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF), known for its retail-branded credit cards, surging some 17% since the market closed Tuesday. Capital One (COF) and Discover plan to merge, and some of the rise in their shares is likely due to optimism that the deal will close under a second Donald Trump administration.

        "body": "Donald Trump is headed back to the White House. Investors believe that’s much better news for some sectors of the U.S. economy than others—and the same goes for different parts of individual Americans’ stock portfolios. Some plays seem obvious. Trump has traditionally been viewed as positive for banks and fossil fuel companies but a scourge for sectors like renewables. Trading on Wednesday morning suggests that view is largely unchanged. Prior to the election, however, several analysts told Fortune the story might not be quite that simple. From tariffs to tax policy, other potential impacts of a second Trump administration also loom large. Below, we've rounded up stocks that might continue to rally or plunge ahead of Trump’s second inauguration: Banks are at the crux of the Trump trade. Jay Hatfield, the CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, isn’t a fan of stock picking based on the presidential race. Nonetheless, he’s willing to say financials will likely benefit from a second Trump term due to presumably lighter regulations. Shares of Goldman Sachs jumped 12% Wednesday morning, with the likes of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup not far behind. That could also hold true for private equity firms and other asset managers, which have been forced to weather a tough period for deal-making. Shares of alternative asset behemoth KKR, which stands to benefit from an uptick in both IPOs and M&A, rose 9% Wednesday to an all-time high above the $150 mark. No sector is likely celebrating a Trump victory quite like the world of crypto, however, which he and the Republican party fully embraced in the summer. That resulted in massive financial support from the industry, which had chafed against the more restrictive policies of the Biden administration. Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase jumped nearly 25% Wednesday morning. MicroStrategy, the largest public corporate holder of Bitcoin, saw its stock rise over 10% as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency smashed record highs. Finally, energy is broadly seen a Trump play thanks to the former president’s promise to “drill, baby, drill.” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for CFRA Research, believes the supply and demand story could be a bit more complicated. Increasing oil production substantially, he said, would reduce the cost of oil. “That would hurt the upstream companies that are drillers, [as well as] exploration and production companies,” he said, “but it would be helpful to the downstream.” The latter includes refiners like Valero Energy and natural gas transportation giant Kinder Morgan, who saw their stocks rise Wednesday over 4% and 6%, respectively.

The stock has traded within an ascending triangle, a bullish chart pattern that indicates a continuation of the stock’s uptrend that started in April. Investors should watch key overhead levels on Tesla's chart around $300 and $350, while monitoring important support areas near $265 and $230.  Tesla (TSLA) shares are likely to remain in the spotlight after surging Wednesday amid investor expectations that the EV maker could benefit from Donald Trump's return to the presidency, as CEO Elon Musk has been one of the former president's most prominent supporters. The stock jumped 15% to $288.53, its highest level in 15 months, to lead Nasdaq Composite gainers on Wednesday. Tesla shares have more than doubled from their April low, boosted in part by optimism surrounding the automaker’s robotaxi ambitions and plans to start production next year on a lower cost model vehicle. Below, we take a closer look at Tesla's chart and use technical analysis to identify important price levels worth watching out for. Since reaching their 2024 high in July, Tesla shares have traded within an ascending triangle, a bullish chart pattern that indicates a continuation of the stock’s uptrend that started in April. To be sure, the price staged a decisive volume-backed breakout on Wednesday, signaling conviction behind the move and potentially opening the door for further upside. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading approaching 70, but also points to nearing overbought conditions that could lead to short-term profit taking. Let’s look at key overhead price levels on Tesla’s chart that could come into play and also identify a couple of important support areas to monitor. Firstly, it’s worth keeping an eye on the $300 level, a location on the chart where the shares could run into selling pressure near the psychological round number and prominent July 2023 swing high. To project an overhead level above this area, we can apply the measuring principle. We do this by calculating the depth of the ascending triangle near its widest point and adding that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $85 and $265, which forecasts an upside target of $350, an area where chart-based investors may consider locking in profits.     ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Currencies in Eastern Europe led losses, sending the emerging-market currency gauge to its worst day since February 2023. The Mexican peso, often seen as the most vulnerable to Trump’s trade policies, edged higher in a volatile session. Earlier in the day, the currency slumped as much as 3.5%. Traders are still uncertain over how a second Trump presidency will affect developing economies. His pledges of stronger restrictions on imports and immigration are fueling bets on higher US borrowing costs and a stronger greenback, dragging down other currencies. “Trade tariffs and other Trump administration policies may be inflationary for the US,” according to Tom Wilson, head of emerging-market equities at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. “The expected outcome would be dollar strength, higher inflation, less easing from the Fed and a higher US yield curve. All of this is broadly unhelpful for EM equity returns, pressuring currencies and limiting freedom of action for central banks.” The MSCI Emerging Market equity index fell 0.6%, dragged lower by Asian stocks as traders priced in punitive tariffs for the world’s second-biggest economy. It was Trump’s trade war against China during his first term that halted an EM equity rally and sparked an underperformance versus the US that continues to this day. China’s stock indexes in Hong Kong slid more than 2.5%. Traders had been preparing for a Trump victory in recent weeks, with currency volatility soaring in the lead-up to the vote, likely easing the blow as the session wore on today. The Republican’s proposals to impose tariffs would hit Mexico — the largest trade partner with the US — particularly hard. On the campaign trail, Trump said automakers building plants in Mexico are a “serious threat” to the US. “There had been a de-risking of certain Latam currencies in the days and weeks prior to the election so this may help explain the move,” said Bret Rosen, economist and strategist for Latin America at EMSO Asset Management. The Mexican peso edged higher at the end of trading in New York, while the Brazilian real erased earlier losses to lead gains among developing nation currencies. Despite the peso rallying up in some instances throughout the afternoon, a Trump presidency still poses risks to the currency ahead, according to Alejandro Cuadrado, strategist at BBVA.

But top swing states Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia were called for Trump, putting him on the cusp of victory. Prediction markets are already pricing nearly 100% odds of a Trump win. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 956 points, or 2.2%, the S&P 500 gained 1.9%, and the Nasdaq added 1.7%. The so-called Trump trade rebounded after retreating Tuesday and Monday. The greenback rose, with the U.S. Dollar Index up 1.5%. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped 10 basis points to 4.38%, and Bitcoin surged 6% to $73,730 after briefly hitting $75,000. Those assets have followed Trump's political prospects because his tariffs, tax cuts, and immigration crackdown are seen as inflationary, limiting the Federal Reserve's ability to lower rates further, while he has also rebranded himself as a champion of the crypto sector. Meanwhile, shares of Trump Media and Technology soared 10% in after-hours trading after closing lower in the regular session amid volatile trading. Tesla climbed 3.5% as CEO Elon Musk has been a top Trump backer, while solar stocks fell as renewable energy stocks could see a rollback of climate initiatives. Overseas markets eyed the U.S. election's final hours cautiously as the next president could have a major impact on the global economy, particularly on trade. Trump has vowed to hike tariffs across the board, with duties on China especially poised to soar. And on Monday, he threatened to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico unless it closed its border with the U.S.—and boost it as high as 100% if it didn't comply. In China, Shanghai’s SSE Composite Index was down 0.1%. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 jumped 2.6% as the yen tumbled against the dollar, making its exports cheaper. Earlier in Europe, the Stoxx 50 ticked up 0.4% while the Stoxx Europe 600 eked out a gain of less than 0.1%. Other races are critical too, as the party that controls Congress will also determine how much leeway the next president has to enact policies. Republicans have flipped the Senate, while the outcome for the House remains unclear. Separately, the Fed wraps up its policy meeting on Thursday, with rates expected to come down 25 basis points. Under another Trump administration, investors expect less regulation from the federal government. That should boost bank stocks, cryptocurrencies and crypto stocks like Coinbase, as well as companies in the oil and gas sector.           ",

The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) — which tracks a basket of 147 small- and mid-cap U.S. banks — jumped 13.4%, posting its largest rally since November 2020. Back then, the announcement of the first COVID-19 vaccine sparked a broad market rebound. In Wednesday's trading, regional banks outshined even the biggest U.S. banks. Financials were the top-performing sector in the S&P 500, with the Financials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) rising 6%. Yet regional banks saw an even greater lift, driven by expectations that Trump’s policies will uniquely benefit smaller, domestic-focused institutions. The strength in regional banks also fueled a broader rally in small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 index, which includes a significant portion of regional banks, surged 6% as investor optimism spread across smaller, U.S.-centric companies. Regional banks are the most representative sector of the Russell 2000 index, which soared by 6% on Wednesday. JPMorgan analyst Anthony Elian sees multiple factors that could fuel a strong performance for regional banks under Trump’s leadership. “We view these results as being favorable for the regional bank sector tied to several tailwinds,” Elian wrote in a note on Wednesday. He highlighted seven main drivers: Increased lending activity – A pro-business and onshoring agenda is expected to boost lending, potentially driving a revival in loan growth across the industry. Lower corporate taxes – Trump’s anticipated tax cuts could enhance profitability for regional banks by reducing their tax burden. Eased regulatory environment – According to Elian, “a second Trump administration would include an easier backdrop for regulation for the industry,” which could help banks reduce compliance costs and expand operations. Uptick in M&A activity – With a favorable regulatory climate, the sector could see an increase in mergers and acquisitions, a trend that was prevalent during Trump's first term and could benefit mid-sized banks seeking growth. Attractive valuations – Elian noted that regional banks remain undervalued by historical standards, suggesting “there is still material upside on the table.” Steep Treasury yield curve, Fed still in easing mode – With the Treasury yield curve in a steep pattern and the Federal Reserve to keep lowering rates, regional banks could benefit from improved net interest margins (NIMs) and net interest income (NII), boosting their earnings and profitability over time. Underweight positioning – Elian highlighted that investors are still largely underweight on regional bank stocks, indicating room for increased demand as sentiment shifts.           ",

Traders moved to price in a high chance of a 50-bps rate cut in November. However, data since then has demonstrated robust demand in the labor market. Consequently, markets are pricing a 98% chance of a 25bps rate cut. At the same time, traders will watch the tone during the meeting for clues on future moves. Recent policymaker remarks have revealed extreme caution owing to a series of upbeat reports. Some policymakers have projected only one more rate cut this year. However, the recent jobs reports showed slower job growth, with the economy adding only 12,000 jobs, well below estimates. This might push the US central bank to lower borrowing costs again in December. If policymakers signal another cut, the dollar index might fall. On the other hand, caution might propel the dollar index higher. At the moment, the dollar is shining after a Trump win. This outcome suggests higher inflation, which might complicate the Fed’s rate-cutting cycle. On the technical side, the dollar index has surged beyond the 104.50 resistance level. The price gapped above the 22-SMA after puncturing the 103.50 support level. The gap showed massive bullish momentum, which has propelled the index to make a new high in the uptrend. This surge came from Trump’s win. Meanwhile, the FOMC meeting might cause a pullback if policymakers are dovish. The Bank of England will hold its policy meeting on the same day as the Fed. Economists believe the central bank will lower borrowing costs by 25-bps. In September, Britain recorded a low inflation rate of 1.7%, below the central bank’s target. Consequently, experts believe this will push the BoE to cut rates. However, most economists believe there will be no move in December. Since markets have already priced a move in November, the rate cut might have little impact on GBP/USD. However, any clues about future moves might increase volatility for the pair. If policymakers signal more rate cuts this year, the pound will collapse. However, the economy is steady and underlying inflation remains high. Therefore, this might mean a cautious tone that will boost the pound.                ",

In the 16-page campaign platform listed on Trump's website, positions on energy policies include increasing oil, natural gas, and coal production, while reversing Biden administration policies favoring renewable energy. Trump's ability to reverse legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, which studies have shown has accelerated the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, will hinge on how Republicans fare in the remaining races yet to be decided in the House of Representatives. The party has secured a slight majority in the Senate, per the races already called by the AP. ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow In the run-up to Tuesday’s election, Wall Street had been positioning for the risk of a rocky spell after the vote. Instead, Trump’s clear win drove the VIX Index, a measure of volatility known as the “fear gauge,” to its second biggest one-day drop since 2021 as the S&P 500 Index jumped 2.5%. The moves forced systematically inclined funds to rebalance by plowing into stocks, creating a technically driven feedback loop that’s adding to the other forces behind the advance. “The year-end rally starts today and may be higher than investors were expecting,” Scott Rubner, a tactical specialist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. Behind it, he cited “unwinds of election hedges, re-levering, Buybacks, FOMO, Vanna,” a type of buying tied to the periodic expiration of option contracts. Volatility-controlled funds are expected to buy $50 billion of US shares in the next month and a total of $110 billion through January, according to an analysis by Nomura Securities International. The Japanese bank is also predicting a significant shift into global equities by so-called risk-parity funds. Rubner also sees the potential for high levels of buying from those two types of investment vehicles. Typically driven by volatility signals rather than fundamentals forces, the managed-risk funds are acutely sensitive to changes in the severity of daily price swings. They tend to curb their risk exposure when turbulence breaks out, then do the opposite when the volatility subsides. The jump Wednesday is marking such a shift, allowing funds to add back risk after reducing equity exposure when Wall Street was bracing for a potentially prolonged period of volatility if the election’s outcome remained in doubt. Other technical factors were also supportive. Funds that use derivatives to offer juiced-up returns on specific companies or indexes were also expected to generate about $15 billion of buying near the close Wednesday, Morgan Stanley’s Christopher Metli wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. The flows are most likely to boost tech stocks, particularly semiconductor companies, due to the number of funds that focus on them.          ",

        "body": "Updated at 5:37 AM EST Tesla shares look set to open at the highest levels in more than a year Wednesday following what appears to be a decisive victory for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 elections. Elon Musk has been a vocal and high-profile supporter of the former president's campaign, raising millions of dollars through his political action committee and appearing at key campaign rallies throughout the autumn. The Tesla  (TSLA)  CEO could now be in line for a key role in the Trump administration, possibly heading what some have called a 'government efficiency commission' aimed at lopping hundreds of billions of spending from the federal budget. Trump also spoke in glowing tones during an address to his supporters in Palm Beach, Fla., late Tuesday, calling him a \"new star\" in the Republican Party and a \"super genius\" that needs to be protected. He also praised Musk's effort on the campaign trail and his willingness to deploy the Starlink satellite internet service in North Carolina following Hurricane Helene. “He’s a character, he’s a special guy, he’s a super genius,” Trump said. “We have to protect our geniuses; we don’t have that many of them.” A Trump administration is also likely to revamp the broader electric-vehicle landscape by imposing stricter tariffs on cars made overseas and removing some of the tax credits and rebates that have unpinned the profit potential for newer market entrants such as Ford Motor  (F)  and General Motors  (GM) . The Washington Post/Getty Images Tesla, however, with its large and established manufacturing facilities in the U.S., could provide the group with an edge over its domestic rivals, argues Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. \"Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players from flooding the US market over the coming years,\" he said. Ives also sees a new Trump administration as potentially fast-tracking some of the self-driving initiatives that Tesla is relying on to power its near-term growth should Republicans maintain control of the House of Representatives. \"The autonomous fast tracking will be front and center for investors in this scenario as some of the 2026/2027 goals for Tesla could be accelerated to stay on track with the China timeline for autonomous currently underway,\" he said.

        "body": "Second-hand car sales are climbing as cash-strapped consumers shun the new vehicle market. The number of used car transactions rose by 4.3pc from July to September compared to a year ago to reach 1.96m, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Of these, a record 53,423 were electric vehicles (EVs) – an increase of 57pc, or about 19,000. However, EVs still made up only 2.7pc of the market, with more traditional petrol and diesel cars still accounting for 91.7pc combined. Hybrids made up the rest of the market. The top five used cars sold were the Ford Fiesta, the Vauxhall Corsa, the Volkswagen Golf, the Ford Focus and the Mini. The continued rise in used car sales stands in stark contrast to the faltering new car market, which saw a 4pc drop in purchases by private consumers over the third quarter. Ian Plummer, commercial director at Auto Trader, the online marketplace for used cars, said there continued to be strong demand for “middle-aged” EVs, defined as vehicles that are three to five years old. Many have now reached price parity with their petrol or diesel equivalents. He added; “With the recent lacklustre performance in the new car market, it’s very positive to see such strong consumer appetite for used EVs. “On our platform, demand has rocketed this year, especially among the middle-aged electric cars. “They’re currently flying off forecourts 10 days faster than the rest of the used car market, which highlights just how vital a role affordable prices will play in the UK’s transition to electric.” However, Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, warned that the growth of the used market “depends on a healthy new car market, particularly for EVs”. The SMMT is lobbying the Government to provide bigger financial incentives for consumer purchases of EVs, amid concerns that manufacturers are currently having to discount each car by £5,500 on average to get them out of showrooms. The industry has warned that such discounts are not sustainable. Mr Hawes said: “Giving consumers the confidence to switch from their familiar petrol or diesel vehicles requires confidence and incentives, otherwise many would-be new car buyers will sit on their hands, leading to a diminishing market that will inevitably limit used car availability and affordability. “This will be to the cost of motorists, the economy and the environment – making a review of support for the transition and the regulation intended to deliver it, an urgent priority.” The Government’s main policy for encouraging the takeup of EVs, known as the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, imposes sales targets for new cars on manufacturers. Companies face fines for falling short of these targets, leading to suggestions that some are rationing petrol and diesel car sales in order to avoid penalties.    ",

        "body": "The S&P 500 can add to record highs through year-end with Trump headed to the White House, Goldman says. The end of political uncertainty will bring back investors and spark a post-election rally. M&A activity will likely pick up under Trump, presenting another bull case for stocks. With the presidential election wrapped up, Goldman Sachs anticipates that the stock market will keep moving higher. The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average, and Nasdaq 100 all hit all-time highs on Wednesday after Donald Trump's presidential-election victory pleased investors anticipating his pro-business policies. According to analysts led by chief US equity strategist David Kostin, there are three reasons why the momentum will keep up: First, the drop in political uncertainty following a presidential race typically fuels robust year-end returns during election years. Historically, the S&P has generated a median return of 4% between Election Day and the year's calendar end, Goldman said. If the same happens this time, that would push the benchmark index up to around 6015, reflecting a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22x. \"Along with the resolution of election uncertainty, resilient recent economic growth data and continued Fed rate cuts support the healthy near-term outlook for US stocks,\" analysts wrote. However, the bank warned that a steep increase in Treasury yields could muddy any post-election rally. That could happen, as the 10-year rate has already climbed to more than 4.4% as anticipation of a Trump win mounted through October. Some consider this signal that bond traders are worried over the US fiscal trajectory under Trump, given that he has offered little policy solutions to the country's growing debt pile. On the other hand, Goldman notes that equities have dismissed the rise in yields as they have also climbed on signs of a stronger economy. Second, the stock market should move higher as investors reallocate into equities. According to Goldman, investors decreased equity exposure of the election, with hedge funds reducing both net and gross leverage across recent weeks. With uncertainty now headed lower, investors are likely to reposition into the market, boosting S&P appreciation, the bank said. Finally, bolstered M&A and IPO activity under Trump's administration will further support stock prices, Goldman speculates. Regulation that has come to challenge mergers in recent years will likely be relaxed under the president-elect, boosting business confidence and corporate cash spending, the bank said. An estimated $4 trillion in spending next year would be split between paying shareholders and investing in growth.   ",

Affirm Holdings (AFRM) is set to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday, with analysts expecting the buy now, pay later (BNPL) firm to aggressively pursue new users as interest rates decline. Wall Street expects Affirm to report revenue growing nearly 34% year-over-year to $663.9 million, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. Analysts broadly expect the fintech firm to post a net loss of $107.5 million, or 33 cents per diluted share, according to Visible Alpha. Deutsche Bank anticipates revenue of about $670 million, the high end of Affirm's guidance. Its analysts described falling interest rates as an opportunity for a company that has \"deftly\" handled credit. Affirm quickly adjusted its underwriting techniques and merchant fees when unemployment skyrocketed during the onset of COVID-19, the analysts said in an Oct. 28th note. \"With interest rates now coming down, [Affirm] gains the opportunity to approve more users as lower funding costs allow it to be more aggressive,\" they wrote. Terms vary, but BNPL products tend to use short-term loans to break up a purchase into fixed installments, without interest. Fintech companies may charge merchants for facilitating BNPL deals with their customers, as well as fees to delinquent borrowers. Affirm recently launched in the United Kingdom, and additional growth is expected domestically from Amazon.com (AMZN) and Shopify (SHOP) customers, the note said.

Fears over import tariffs, which Trump has threatened on goods from the EU, caused shares in BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche to fall 5.2-7.7%, among the biggest decliners across Europe. BMW's stock hit a four-year low, also driven by weak third-quarter results, while shares in Porsche - which has no production facilities in the U.S. - hit their lowest level since its initial public offering in September 2022. BMW CEO Oliver Zipse sought to allay fears after presenting bleak third-quarter results, pointing to the company's strong local footprint that includes its largest plant worldwide. The U.S. market accounted for 12.9% of the 3.1 million in German passenger car exports in 2023, making it the single-biggest export market for carmakers in Europe's biggest economy. Goldman Sachs reckons that if the U.S. were to increase tariffs by 7.5-17.5%, \"we see the largest headwind to EBIT at Volvo Cars, followed by Mercedes, Porsche, BMW and VW\". BMW's plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, produces more than 1,500 vehicles a day, making it the company's biggest factory worldwide and a main exporter to markets including Germany, China and Britain. LARGE FOOTPRINT Zipse, speaking to journalists after presenting third-quarter results, said BMW may even have \"more of an advantage\" if there were tariffs \"because we have a very, very large footprint in the USA\". \"In this respect, we shouldn't be too nervous about what might happen,\" Zipse said, adding BMW was present at 30 locations across 12 U.S. states. He said that two-thirds of BMW's vehicle sales in the U.S. were produced in Spartanburg, and that BMW was committed to investing further in the site with its more than 11,000 employees. In the first nine months of 2024, BMW's deliveries in the United States were down 2.1% at 271,399 vehicles. The Spartanburg plant alone produced 410,793 vehicles in 2023, of which more than half were exported to 120 countries, leaving ample room for BMW to sell more locally should tariffs be slapped on vehicle imports. \"There's some natural cover-up against possible tariffs,\" Zipse said. Mercedes-Benz has two production plants in the U.S. - in Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Charleston, South Carolina - which between them produced 346,600 vehicles last year, around 14% of the automaker's total sales. About two-thirds of the Tuscaloosa plant's output is exported.   ",

Hong Kong absorbed most of the fallout, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises index dropping 2.6% on Wednesday. China's CSI 300 slid 0.5% after declining as much as 1% at intraday lows. Wednesday's sell-off reflects heightened fear that global trade relations with the US could turn sour in Trump's second term. Analysts have warned of impending trade wars if the president-elect fulfills his promise to implement universal tariffs, pledging 60% duties on Chinese exports. \"We believe that tariffs are the most potentially consequential policy from an economic perspective,\" UBS wrote in a note Wednesday. \"The mooted 60% tariff on imports from China and a 10% tariff on imports from the rest of the world could make much of US-China trade unviable, reduce US domestic demand and corporate profits, and lead to lower GDP growth around the world, particularly in China.\" This fresh uncertainty also weighed on international currencies.

He’s an amazing guy.” Musk, who described himself as “Dark MAGA,” said he had gone “all in” on backing Trump.

Tesla's stock soared as much as 14% after the market opened, and was up more than 12.8% in late morning trading. Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsed Trump's bid to return to the White House and was a prominent financial backer of his campaign. Trump has been critical of incentives and subsidies for EVs, but has commended Musk's work with Tesla and praised him as a \"super genius\" during his victory speech early Wednesday morning. Trump's White House Win Sends Dow Up 1,000 Points Wall Street anticipates the incoming Trump administration will cut taxes and pursue a deregulatory agenda similar to the former president's first term in office. Read On The Fox Business App Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors that the \"biggest positive from a Trump win would be for Tesla and Musk.\" He explained that while the firm thinks a Trump presidency \"would be an overall negative for the EV industry\" due to EV rebates and tax incentives being eliminated, that could be a \"huge positive\" for Tesla.

Ives explained that Tesla may accelerate some of its 2026 and 2027 autonomous driving initiatives to stay on track with the autonomous driving push by Chinese automakers. \"We believe a Trump win could add $40-$50 per share to Tesla's stock and exceed $1 trillion in market cap if autonomous/FSD is accelerated starting in 2025 and a tailwind for Cybercab,\" he added.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow US stocks surged, with S&P futures climbing 2.3%; the dollar posted its biggest gain against major currencies since 2020; Treasury bonds tumbled, sending benchmark yields up by almost 20 basis points; and Bitcoin soared to a record. The swings send a clear signal that investors believe a second Trump administration will look a lot like the first one: a stream of policies (tax cuts, deregulation, tariffs) that will simultaneously stoke economic growth, corporate profits and inflation. For those on Wall Street who’ve been riding the Trump Trade, and especially those who held their nerve as it wobbled on the eve of polling, it was a moment of vindication. “If you had the Trump trade on for the last six weeks, it’s been outstanding,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, a rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle Investment. “The question is these winning runs don’t last forever and is this a good time to take profits.” While the message from investors is broadly positive, there is also a stern warning in the market gyrations. The surge in Treasury yields underscores concerns that Trump’s policies will swell an already bloated budget deficit and reignite an inflation spiral that the Federal Reserve was only just finally quelling in the wake of the pandemic. The 30-year yield climbed as much as 23 basis points to 4.67%, its biggest daily jump since 2020. The 10-year breakeven rate, a market gauge of where long-term inflation is heading, surged to its highest levels since April. In the parlance of Wall Street, this is the bond vigilantes exerting pressure on leaders in Washington to keep spending in check. “Vigilantes are in full control. Panic is starting to set in, the coiling we expected is happening,” said NatAlliance Securities’ Andrew Brenner. In contrast, European bonds rallied as traders rushed to price in faster interest-rate cuts in the region, seeing potential global trade tariffs as a headwind for the region’s fragile economy. That’s a boon for investors including Vanguard which had bet on German bonds outperforming in recent weeks. A key outstanding question for markets is whether Republicans end up with the “trifecta,” meaning a situation where they gain control of the Senate, the House and the White House. Beyond that, it remains to be seen whether Trump will actually deliver his campaign-trail promises.                         ",

Shares pared gains throughout the trading day to close around 6% higher. With a win in Wisconsin, Trump secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win, according to the Associated Press. The Republican is now set to have the distinction of being the 45th and the 47th US president. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $36 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $7.2 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $4.3 billion and making him roughly $500 million richer compared to where shares closed on Tuesday. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — had risen around 25% in after-hours moves late Tuesday as Harris's route to victory narrowed, then jumped again after the win was declared in the early morning on Wednesday. The stock had a wild session in the run up to the election. Trading was halted several times due to volatility, with shares quickly erasing 15% gains and reversing Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. Strategists have categorized the stock as a binary bet on the election. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, recently told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts that the trajectory of shares has hinged on \"a buy the rumor, sell the fact\" trading strategy.

In September, shares in Trump Media traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had bounced back from their lows, though, as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus.        ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Large rallies emerged across many of the market’s riskiest corners in the wake of Trump’s decisive win, with the Russell 2000 Index jumping to near a three-year high. The S&P 500 Index traded to a record of its own, cementing that the backdrop for investors to take on risk through buying shares of unproven companies has rarely been better. The VIX, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” tumbled back to the lowest level since September. “The election was an overhang — it’s not the only factor taken into account — but the outcome will now set up some private equity firms to initiate their processes,” said Steve Parish, co-head of ICR Capital. “For companies that are starting their process or are on the fence for a 2025 IPO, this could provide a boost to encourage them to push forward.” Nearly $40 billion has been raised via initial public offerings on US exchanges this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s a 64% jump from the stretch seen in 2023 through Nov. 6, but still below the average in the decade before the pandemic — including three quarters of Trump’s first term in office, the data show. Pro-Crypto Candidate Bitcoin also powered to a record, as investors digested the prospect of the pro-cryptocurrency candidate unleashing a wave of debuts that had been held up for years amid regulatory scrutiny. That could change if current US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler steps down or if Trump makes good on a promise to fire him. While it’d depend who takes the reins, it’s likely the industry would expect the Trump administration to nominate leadership which is more favorable to crypto assets based on his commentary supporting digital assets, said Matthew Kimmell, digital asset analyst at crypto asset manager and research firm CoinShares. “A second Trump administration could influence the outlook for crypto IPOs, but the extent of impact will largely depend on changes in SEC leadership and the regulatory framework they establish,” Kimmell said. Circle Internet Financial Ltd.’s chief executive officer has been vocal about its intention to IPO, while crypto exchange Kraken and trading platform eToro are also considering going public.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Trump swept to victory in Tuesday’s US presidential election after defeating Kamala Harris across key battleground states. The win boosted the so-called Trump Trade, sending the S&P and the US dollar higher. Bankers and lawyers say Trump’s pro-business focus will be a boon for M&A, giving further fuel to the nascent recovery in dealmaking. There’s “pretty big pent-up demand” for M&A and many companies have been “dusting off their dream deals,” Evercore Inc. Chairman Emeritus Ralph Schlosstein said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Wednesday. Dealmaking is set to be even stronger next year, according to Schlosstein. “The prospect for cuts to corporate taxes and capital gains that he’s promised will further accelerate what was already a recovering M&A cycle,” said Raul Gutierrez, head of M&A at Truist Securities Inc. “You should be able to see larger transactions move forward. Some of these had been put on hold given the current antitrust stance and I think you’ll see a greater willingness to test agencies out once the administration takes over.” President Joe Biden’s administration has been cracking down on deals viewed as having the potential to concentrate corporate power and limit consumer choice. Lina Khan, chair of the US Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, have been testing out new approaches that have made it hard to predict how deals will be received. Large transactions that have fallen under the lens of regulators include Kroger Co.’s near-$25 billion acquisition of fellow grocer Albertsons Cos., which was announced in 2022, as well as Capital One Financial Corp.’s planned $35 billion purchase of credit-card company Discover Financial Services and Synopsys Inc.’s roughly $34 billion agreed takeover of software developer Ansys Inc. Shares in Albertsons, Ansys and Discover all rose on Wednesday, outstripping the S&P 500’s gains. Discover, in particular, saw its stock rise as much as 24% in New York. ‘Regulatory Creep’ Dealmakers expect new appointees at federal agencies under Trump to bring a friendlier approach to M&A. “There’s been a notable shift over the last four years on antitrust so I do think you’ll see pretty meaningful rollback from a number of those policies,” said Eric Rutkoske, head of M&A at Guggenheim Securities LLC. “I think in this interim period — before there’s a change in the composition of the DOJ and FTC — there will be less willingness to challenge deals.”                   ",

The Dow Industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each ended at record levels with investors expecting lower taxes, deregulation and a U.S. president who is not shy to weigh in on everything from the stock market to the dollar, although fresh tariffs could bring challenges in the form of a higher deficit and inflation. The Republican's win powered a rally in so-called \"Trump trades,\" sending U.S. Treasury yields sharply higher, with the benchmark 10-year note yield hitting a four-month high of 4.479%. Bitcoin hit a record high of over $76,000 and the dollar was on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since September 2022. Polls indicated a very tight race, with some concern the process could be drawn out before a victor was declared. \"Investors were kind of portfolio jockeying to score up some of their risk exposure in anticipation of an outcome that was going into it, seemingly a toss-up,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \"And obviously, it turned very quickly and led to a very much risk-on day today in which anything that isn't tied to the ground from a cyclical or pro-growth standpoint is absolutely launching.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,508.05 points, or 3.57%, to 43,729.93, the S&P 500 gained 146.28 points, or 2.53%, to 5,929.04 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 544.29 points, or 2.95%, to 18,983.47. Both the Dow and S&P 500 registered their biggest one-day percentage gains since November 2022. The Nasdaq notched its biggest daily percentage gain since February. Financials jumped 6.16% as the best performing of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors. Banks, expected to benefit from loosening regulations under Trump, powered the gains, with the S&P 500 bank index up 10.68%, its biggest daily jump in two years. The small-cap Russell 2000 rallied 5.84%, its biggest surge since November 2022, to a three-year high, with the domestically concentrated stocks seen as likely to benefit from easier regulations, lower taxes and less exposure to import tariffs. However, rising Treasury yields could hurt smaller companies, which tend to rely heavily on borrowing and are more sensitive to higher interest rates. \"This move up in interest rates ... if it doesn't stall out here somewhere around this 4.4%, 4.5% level or so, and we start to retest those levels we saw last October of 5%, that could not only put small caps, but the market itself on its heels,\" said Luschini.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The America-first trade — buying up assets that win when the US outperforms the rest of the world — got a powerful boost Wednesday on bets the Republican victor is set to unleash polices that will spur domestic growth and insulate the world’s largest economy from overseas competition. A cohort of investors are cheering on the prospect that tax cuts will be a boon for business — big and small — while tariffs may fuel a manufacturing renaissance at home and favor American workers. An exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 (ticker SPY) climbed 2.5%, in contrast to a 1.4% loss for an ETF (IEFA) investing in developed-country equities more broadly. The divergence was last on display in 2016, the year when Trump notched his first presidential victory. “This is a power trade on steroids,” said David Rosenberg, founder and president of Rosenberg Research, referring to the risk-on rally in favor of US assets. A pair of ETFs representing made-in-America investment themes are on the tear. The First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF (ticker AIRR) climbed 8%, while the Tema American Reshoring ETF (RSHO) added 6%. Both hit record highs. With Trump’s disruptive protectionist agenda in focus, stocks in emerging markets sank, trailing their American counterparts by the most in two years. The specter of faster economic growth, and potentially higher inflation, under Trump’s return fueled a spike in Treasury yields. Five-year Treasury yields added 13 basis points while comparable yields in Germany were down 9 basis points, marking a rare divergence since the German unification in the early 1990s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg columnist Cameron Crise. Still, the billionaire businessman’s policies are not all positive for the domestic economy, at first blush. For instance, his proposed tariffs are projected to potentially hurt GDP and corporate earnings, while swelling a government deficit. Yet for now, investors are willing to give him the benefit of doubt — focusing instead on the potential benefit from business-friendly measures, such as deregulation and tax cuts. Indexes of small-cap stocks and regional banks, companies among most exposed to domestic growth, surged 6% and 13%, respectively.              ",

Mainland China was a lucrative market for Wall Street investment banks and major U.S. asset managers to expand in the decade leading up to the pandemic as the world's second-largest economy recorded double-digit economic growth. However, those firms now face risks of even more trade tensions between Beijing and Washington under a new U.S. administration with their Chinese units already reeling from faltering economic growth and regulatory changes that have hit revenues. Trump, who recaptured the White House with a sweeping victory on Wednesday, has proposed tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% and ending China's most-favoured-nation trading status. There are also concerns about the measures he could take to make U.S. capital inflows into China and American financial firms working with some Chinese companies tougher, analysts said. Singapore-based consulting firm Kapronasia's research director Joe Jelinek said Trump would likely bring a tougher stance on China, increasing regulatory risks for U.S. financial firms operating there. New or increased tariffs and capital restrictions could discourage Wall Street firms from expanding into China, as they face heightened scrutiny and potential compliance issues, he said. \"Rather than Beijing closing its doors, it's likely that American firms themselves would reconsider their China strategies to mitigate these risks,\" Jelinek said, adding that could lead to a pullback or delayed investments. A senior executive at a China-licenced entity of a large U.S. financial firm told Reuters that his firm had gone through a few rounds of \"risk management meetings\" at headquarters in months leading up to the election. As a result of Trump's return to the White House, the firm now focuses on making its China business a \"self-sustained\" independent operating unit, said the executive, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. \"It will be a very bumpy road ahead for U.S financial companies doing business in China with Trump returning to the White House,\" said the executive. \"'De-Americanise' has now become a guiding principle.\" STRATEGY RETHINK Some Wall Street firms have already shrunk their Chinese footprints as a slowing economy and sharper regulatory scrutiny of corporate dealmaking and fundraising over the last couple of years dimmed the market's revenue potential.

Governor Fatih Karahan, after presenting the bank’s latest outlook for the economy on Friday, said the sizable revisions to his forecasts don’t imply a change in the policy stance in either direction. Any future cut in the bank’s policy rate will not result in a loosening of monetary policy as it would follow improvements in inflation’s main trend, Karahan said. “We will continue our tight policy stance until price stability is restored,” Karahan said during his speech. The comments show Karahan wants to refrain from providing much clarity on when his Monetary Policy Committee might start cutting the benchmark rate after having kept it at 50% since March. Most analysts have pushed their expectations for the beginning of the easing cycle further into the future, with many of them now seeing rate reductions before 2025 highly unlikely. The lira was little changed as the governor spoke, trading 0.4% lower at 34.3606 per dollar as of 11:20 a.m. in Istanbul. Turkey’s main stock index Borsa Istanbul 100 extended gains to 0.9%, driven higher by a surge in banks. --With assistance from Baris Balci.

Net income came in at $747.9 million or $2.33 per share, up from $545.3 million or $1.72 per share a year earlier and above projections. However, Arista's gross margin in the third quarter was 64.2%, down slightly from 64.9% a quarter earlier. In the fourth quarter, Arista said it expects gross margins to fall to between 63% and 64%. Arista forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, ahead of the consensus estimate compiled by Visible Alpha. Some investors may have had higher expectations. Ahead of Thursday's results, Citi analysts had projected 28% growth in the fourth quarter, anticipating accelerating cloud spending driven by AI demand. Arista also announced a four-for-one stock split, meant to make its stock accessible to more investors, with split-adjusted trading set to start on Dec. 4. The company said its stockholders will receive three additional shares for every one share they hold. The split will reduce the price of each share by a factor of four, but won't change the total value of investors' holdings. Shares of Arista fell more than 7% in extended trading Thursday following the release. They were up about 83% for the year through Thursday's close. ",

Emanuel says the S&P 500 will reach 6,600 by the end of June, implying an 11% gain from current levels. He points to Trump's deregulatory agency, which could help boost corporate profits. \"This market will be driven higher by the policy prospect of deregulation in DC,\" Emanuel wrote in a Wednesday note. Emanuel says Trump will likely act fast to enact his policies when he re-enters the White House. Things like deregulation and corporate tax cuts will boost business activity and allow stocks to surge, he said. \"Exuberance lies ahead; President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response.\" The bull market's two-year run has been driven by strong growth from mega-cap tech stocks, and high valuations will rise even higher, he said. \"Expensive has a history of getting more expensive and lasting longer with greater gains,\" Emanuel said. He pointed to data showing the average bull market sees a rise of 152% over 50 months, while the current market has seen just a 65% gain in the last 25 months, he says. It's \"still an infant,\" Emanuel said. Emanuel's projected jump for the S&P 500 through the middle of next year comes after Trump won the presidential election in a sweeping victory earlier this week, fueling widespread investor optimism. Indexes soared to record highs on Wednesday after the election result was called, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining over 1,500 points.

Shares of Wolfspeed (WOLF) plunged Thursday after the chipmaker posted weaker-than-expected sales and guidance, and announced job cuts as it moves to simplify its business. The company said it expects a current-quarter net loss of $362 million to $401 million, and revenue from continuing operations of $160 million to $200 million. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $282.2 million and $181.3 million, respectively. Wolfspeed said that during the fiscal first quarter it incurred $87.1 million in restructuring expenses. It anticipates having another $174 million charge in the current quarter. The company also said it is facing “significant factory start up costs” for the plants it is building or expanding which have not started generating revenue.

        "body": "MILAN (Reuters) — Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk's (NVO, NOVO-B.CO) shares hit an over 9-month low on Thursday after surging more than 8% the previous day, as underwhelming guidance for next year overshadowed strong sales growth for its popular Wegovy weight-loss drug. The two-day move saw Europe's biggest company by market cap trade in a wide 14-percentage-point range from low to high. On Thursday morning, the stock was down 3% in Copenhagen, after earlier falling 5.5% to its lowest since January. In an analyst call on Wednesday, following a quarterly release that eased concerns that demand for Wegowy was slowing, Novo's finance chief Karsten Munk Knudsen said sales growth next year could be in the high percentage teens. Barclays said commentary on 2025 weighed on the shares. \"We had a call back with IR and the moving parts seem to indicate (at least what we know now) a midpoint for FY25 top line a touch lower than current company consensus,\" Emily Field, analyst at the UK bank, wrote in a note, affirming her overweight rating on the stock. The company will formally guide for 2025 in February. US-listed Novo shares were up 1.6% in premarket trading on Thursday, having lost over 4% the prior session. Gilles Guibout, head of European equity strategies at AXA Investment Managers in Paris, said the sharp moves in Novo's shares were probably due to hedge fund action. \"Novo Nordisk is a widely held stock. Its market has significant potential. However, it's easier to find sellers than buyers for the stock, as everyone already holds plenty of it,\" he said. \"It's a stock that needs to be normalised. At the beginning of the year, there was too much hype around it,\" he added. Novo Nordisk shares are up around 4% so far this year, but they have fallen almost 30% from the record high set in June. The stock trades at a 27 times its expected earnings, a 22% premium to its 20-year average valuation, according to LSEG Datastream data. It is worth around $470 billion.

That was after Jerome Powell said the economy is strong while refraining from signaling whether the Federal Reserve will skip cutting rates, following Thursday’s reduction of a quarter percentage point. Treasury yields dropped across the curve and the dollar saw its biggest decline since August. “Powell & Co. reminded investors about the solid economic footing the US continues to stand on,” said Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro. “Powell would not tip his hand on whether the Fed would likely cut rates in December, which shouldn’t surprise investors. However, the Fed appears more comfortable with the labor market and the current US economic backdrop than they did a few months ago.” Fed officials unanimously lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. They tweaked language to note “labor market conditions have generally eased,” and repeated “the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.” The statement removed the reference to “further” inflation progress, noting inflation “has made progress toward the committee’s 2% objective but remains somewhat elevated.” To Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research, the latest Fed statement does not put a December skip in play. “We thought Powell’s comments were generally dovish, and he gave several indications that a December cut remains his base case,” said Aditya Bhave at Bank of America Corp. “Given that the policy mix will not change for a while, we remain comfortable with our call for another 25bp cut in December.” The S&P 500 rose 0.7%.

        "body": "By Ananya Mariam Rajesh (Reuters) - Elf Beauty, a maker of affordable cosmetics, is betting on rural markets and a tie-up with Dollar General to fuel its expansion as it hedges against a slowdown in the U.S. cosmetic industry where shoppers have shied away from pricey makeup. The company raised its forecasts for annual sales and profit on Wednesday, in contrast to legacy cosmetics brands like Estee Lauder and L'Oreal that have been facing weak demand. Shares in Oakland, California-based Elf rose 10% in pre-market trading on Thursday. The high-flying stock has taken a hit in recent months as its sales growth eases off record levels. The company said the partnership with Dollar General would allow it to sell cosmetics such as lip oil and liquid blush at some of the retailer's stores. Elf - short for eyes, lips and face - sells its products, some as low as $2, at U.S. retailers including Walmart, Ulta Beauty and Target. With Dollar General, Elf is trying to find a bigger foothold with lower-income customers. The dollar store largely serves families with an annual income less than $35,000, according to the company, and has its largest concentration of stores in suburban Texas, Georgia and North Carolina. Dollar General currently offers L'Oreal's Maybelline and Coty's CoverGirl products. \"Our mission is to make the best of beauty accessible to every eye, lip and face and the accessibility is quite important to U.S. Dollar General's stated strategy of serving the underserved fits perfectly,\" CEO Tarang Amin said on Wednesday. \"If you think about 80% of their stores are in rural areas with less than 20,000 consumers. Previously, those consumers only had access to some of the legacy mass brands.\" Elf did not say how many Dollar General stores would stock its products but added that it would take a call on expansion based on the initial feedback. Global cosmetics giants L'Oreal and Estee Lauder have been facing an uphill battle to regain cost-conscious customers. While Maybelline's Washable Mascara sells for $10.50 on Dollar General's website, Elf's Lash it Loud Mascara is priced at $6, according to its own website. The partnership with Dollar General is a \"good symbiotic relationship,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns a stake in Elf. For the cosmetic maker, it offers an entry into an untapped market and for Dollar General it could mean more foot traffic because of the positive reputation of Elf's products, he said.       ",

        "body": "Financial stocks have surged ahead of tech in year-to-date performance, fueled by a Trump-led rally on Wednesday that lifted banks and brokers amid investor expectations of a deregulation-friendly political landscape ahead. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) has risen by 30% in 2024, outpacing the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK), which is up 26% this year. Small and mid-sized banks, tracked by the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE), have also seen strong performance, with a 13% jump following election results, bringing them in line with tech sector gains. Financial stocks, which have lagged behind technology for six of the past seven years, are now catching up, propelled by renewed optimism for deregulation and M&A activities. Analysts Expect M&A Activity to Heat Up With the Trump administration’s return to the White House, analysts are projecting a significant uptick in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the financial sector. “Under the upcoming Trump II administration, we expect a more favorable backdrop for M&A which could lead to additional activity in the space after having been quiet for the past few years,” said Anthony Elian, CFA, analyst at JPMorgan. Lower regulatory barriers could pave the way for consolidation among smaller banks, while larger financial institutions are expected to benefit from a more active capital markets environment.

For fintech firms, this shift could relieve recent regulatory scrutiny, particularly in areas such as connectivity with traditional banks and practices overseen by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Companies involved in digital assets stand to benefit even more, as regulatory clarity would open the door for new market entrants and increase industry participation. \"Digital assets could arguably be the biggest winner of them all,\" said Ryan, who sees sentiment in the space \"improving materially from here.\"                                                   ",

        "body": "Markets are rising, and investor sentiment remains bullish. The conventional wisdom is predicting further gains, on the assumption that we’re still in a long-term bull market. And it would seem that Wall Street’s institutions are in agreement. Watching the situation from UBS, chief US equity strategist Jonathan Golub has set out his own agreement with the bullish view. Golub explains where the market is finding support, and goes on to lay out where markets are likely to go. “Rate cuts should lower interest expense and default risk, adding to both EPS and valuations. Financial conditions point to less stress/more liquidity, a positive for valuations,” Golub said. “We are adjusting our year-end 2024-25 S&P 500 targets to 5850 and 6400, from 5600 and 6000… These forecasts are based on EPS estimates of $240, $257, and $275 for 2024-26, implying 9.1%, 7.1% and 7.0% growth.” Against this backdrop, UBS analysts have issued recommendations on 2 stocks, highlighting each based on its strong growth prospects. According to TipRanks, both stocks also boast substantial support from the Street with a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Here are the details, and the bank’s comments on both. Allegro MicroSystems (ALGM) First up is Allegro MicroSystems, a semiconductor company with a focus on integrated circuits (ICs), a key component in a wide range of technological and industrial applications. Allegro’s IC products are used in sensor hardware and in application-specific analog power systems, and are particularly useful in the automotive industry, where they are vital parts of electric vehicle charging systems, industrial regulators, and various motors and motorized factory conveyor systems. The company’s products are vital for autonomous driving safety systems, factory automation, and, outside the auto industry, in power-saving technologies for data centers. Like many chip makers, Allegro is a ‘fabless’ company; that is, it handles the design and development work on its products and puts together the prototypes – while farming out the mass production work to outside chip foundries. The fabless model allows Allegro to focus its energies and resources on putting together the strongest product line for its customer base. And right now, that customer base is extensive. The company boasts over 10,000 enterprise customers worldwide and claims more than 50 OEMs from the automotive industry in its customer list. Allegro’s chip products are widespread in the world’s automotive supply chain, with more than 9 in the typical car on the road today. The company has over 650 US patents to protect its intellectual property and has shipped out a cumulative total of more than 11 billion sensors.               ",

It will be a week or two before the “dust settles” enough for authorities to determine what the outcome of the election means for monetary policy, Rhee said after the meeting ended. During the meeting, Choi noted that financial markets remain largely calm as the impact from Trump’s win eases. Short-term interest rates, stock prices and bond yields remain stable, he added. “In the event of excessive market volatility, we will actively respond in accordance with our situation-specific response plan,” Choi said. Friday’s gathering came after the Federal Reserve voted unanimously Thursday to lower the federal funds rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The meeting marked Choi’s second rendezvous with economic and financial policymakers in Seoul since the US election resulted in a resounding victory for Trump. The BOK is preparing for an interest-rate decision in late November, where economists generally expect authorities to hold settings steady after they conducted a policy pivot in October with a quarter-percentage-point cut to the benchmark rate. The South Korean currency’s recent weakness against the dollar is a factor that makes the bank wary of easing settings too quickly. A growing number of economists expect the BOK to accelerate its easing cycle if economic momentum slows next year.

Trump’s resounding win in the US election has already had a big impact, sending the dollar soaring, pushing the S&P 500 to an all-time high, and leading to a surge in Treasury yields as traders assess the inflation impact of more tariffs. It has also brought back memories of his first term. Trump’s market-moving posts included a damning verdict on trade negotiations with China, which sent stocks in the country reeling, and a tweeted threat to levy tariffs on Mexico that weakened the peso and fueled worries about the impact on auto stocks. “We used to call them Twitter bombs,” said Matthew Haupt, a portfolio manager at Wilson Asset in Sydney. “It is how he negotiates.” For many investors, Trump’s second term will mean closely monitoring X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Trump’s own social-media platform Truth Social, his primary conduit to the public. Trump’s “America First” policy, which includes sweeping tariffs on foreign-made goods, is widely expected to hurt financial assets across Europe and emerging markets. Major stock indexes in Europe and China fell as the results emerged on Wednesday, although Japanese stocks got a boost. The pace of Trump’s tweets as well as their ambiguity was a source of volatility in his first term. In 2017, his mysterious ‘covfefe’ tweet stumped markets, fueling a guessing game about a potential hidden meaning. In 2020, the former president once tweeted or retweeted just under 40 times in the space of two hours, causing a whiplash in US and international equities. “It will be 2016 all over again,” said Wong Kok Hoong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities Pte. “Markets will have to embrace more volatility and moves based on Trump’s social media comments. In fact, I have just set up a Truth Social account just to make sure we don’t miss anything!” Trump’s trade negotiations with China and others will be fertile ground for social media surprises as he rolls out his protectionist policies. During his first term, Trump frequently took to X to threaten or implement trade tariffs on allies and rivals alike that stoked a global trade war.           ",

The ridesharing company posted a record 217 million rides for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up 16% from the year-ago period and ahead of the 213 million rides expected, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 forecast, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion. After turning a profit for the first time in the second quarter, Lyft reported a loss of $12.4 million in the most recent period due to restructuring costs in its bikes and scooters division. Lyft CEO David Risher has embarked on an aggressive plan to make the ride-hailing service profitable and take market share from Uber (UBER) since taking over in mid-2023. Lyft shares, while up 74% in the last year as of Thursday, are far below the highs in the $60 range reached in 2021. The company has also struggled to emerge from Uber’s shadow, with the latter holding a 76% share of the US rideshare market. Lyft’s failure to expand beyond North America or break into the food delivery market has hindered its growth. Risher’s plan has included sweeping layoffs to cut costs, revamping the platform’s tech stack, and most recently inking partnerships with DoorDash (DASH), as well as three autonomous vehicle companies. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson in a note to investors Thursday. Erickson is one of the smaller group of analysts tracked by Bloomberg with an Outperform rating on the stock, and he sees shares rising to $24 over the next 12 months.

On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. “Adding [autonomous vehicles] is a huge opportunity, and we look forward to partnering with even more leaders in the industry to shape its future.

Heartland Express projected future turnaround for the industry but not in 2024, according to its Q3 earnings release last week. Amid an imbalance of supply and demand for trucking services, the freight market has lacked meaningful, sustained improvement throughout the last two years, Heartland suggested. Following the worst year in company history, however, encouraging signs in October showed a path to recovery was in store, the company said. Heartland posted a $7.1 million loss amid continued excess capacity and weak demand in Q3, only slightly better than the $7.4 million loss in the same quarter last year. The carrier previously noted inflation affecting its operations when it posted $0.3 million in operating income in Q2 and a $15.1 million loss in Q1. “We believe that the last four quarters of this current freight cycle are arguably the worst four consecutive quarters experienced in the trucking industry over the Company’s 45+ year history,” Heartland CEO Mike Gerdin said in the most recent quarterly update. The company continued to integrate its Smith Transport and Contract Freighters Inc. acquisitions and also realigned priorities to improve performance despite the challenging environment. Ryder and analysts have shared similar outlooks for when the market will improve, pointing past 2024. “We continue to believe that the freight market will improve as more capacity exits the market so the industry as a whole can return to more disciplined operating decisions and improved financial results,” Gerdin said.

Looking ahead to Q2, the company forecast net sales in a range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion, missing Wall Street’s $6.79 billion estimates. Just last week, SMCI shares plunged 32% on news that accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned as its auditor after disclosing in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that it was “unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by [Super Micro Computer’s] management.” Months earlier, Ernst & Young raised significant concerns over Super Micro’s internal controls, board independence, and accounting practices. In response to those initial concerns, Super Micro formed an independent “special committee” and launched a three-month investigation. On Tuesday, Super Micro released its findings, saying it found “no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors” in a company statement, further pushing the stock price down by double digits. Another significant problem the company faces is that it’s at risk of being delisted by the Nasdaq exchange due to its delay in filing its Form 10-K with the SEC. Super Micro said it “remains unable at this time to predict when the Form 10-K will be filed.” (It was due back in August.) Under the Nasdaq rules, Super Micro has 60 days from the date of the SEC notice either to file the Form 10-K or to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules. (If a plan is submitted and accepted, the company could be granted up to 180 days from the Form 10-K’s due date to regain compliance. If Nasdaq does not accept the plan, the company can appeal the decision to a Nasdaq hearings panel.) Either way, the news doesn’t bode well for the future of the stock. Super Micro also said Tuesday “it intends to take all necessary steps to achieve compliance with the Nasdaq” and was “working with urgency to become current again” in filing financial reporting of its latest fiscal year.

Elsewhere, stocks gained in Australia and Taiwan, helping push the region’s benchmark gauge higher for a second day. That was after the S&P 500 advanced 0.7% and the Nasdaq 100 jumped 1.5% as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates as economists forecast. European equity futures rose, while their US counterparts were little changed. Possible measures from China may include support for local government debt and consumer spending, according to Michelle Lam, greater China economist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. Any new policies must be balanced against the prospect of potential tariffs, she said, noting that the 60% levies proposed by Trump may fail to emerge. “We have so much uncertainty coming from the US tariffs,” Lam said. “We might see some smaller increase in tariffs of around 15% to 20% and that is more reasonable” for the Chinese economy to absorb. Thursday’s cross-asset rally was helped by comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell who pointed to the strength of the US economy and said he doesn’t rule “out or in” a December rate cut. Powell added the election will have no effect on policy in the near term, and said he would not step aside if asked by Trump. “Powell & Co. reminded investors about the solid economic footing the US continues to stand on,” said Bret Kenwell at eToro. “Powell would not tip his hand on whether the Fed would likely cut rates in December, which shouldn’t surprise investors. However, the Fed appears more comfortable with the labor market and the current US economic backdrop than they did a few months ago.” Nissan Motor’s shares slumped as much as 10% in Tokyo, touching the lowest since October 2020, after the automaker said it will dismiss 9,000 workers and cut a fifth of its manufacturing capacity after net income plummeted in the first half.

Nearly $3.7 billion worth of contracts tied to the outcome of the presidential election were traded on Polymarket this year. Coplan said the platform plans to expand to the U.S., where the nascent online gambling and betting industries could be aided by Trump's anti-regulation, pro-crypto stance.  President-elect Donald Trump wasn't the only one declaring victory on Wednesday. So were the online betting markets that forecast his election victory. As polls began closing on Tuesday evening, Polymarket, the world's largest prediction market, put the odds of a Trump victory at about 58%. His odds shot up as the night went on, reaching 95% at 11:43 p.m. ET, nearly six hours before the Associated Press called the election. \"I just got word that the Trump campaign HQ literally found out they were winning from Polymarket,\" wrote the platform's founder and CEO, Shayne Coplan, on X early Wednesday morning. Trump had a commanding lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in prediction markets in the month leading up to Tuesday’s election. At one point, the market put his odds of victory at 67% to Harris’s 33%. Conventional polls, meanwhile, showed neither candidate with a lead greater than the margin of error in any key swing state. Coplan told CNBC on Thursday morning that the outcome was a \"vindication\" of the predictive power of his platform, which he called \"the most accurate way to follow the election.\" This was the first U.S. election in which Americans were able to place bets on the outcome. In early October, a federal court sided with prediction market Kalshi in its lawsuit against regulators who had blocked the market from offering event contracts. That ruling opened the door for Kalshi and other prediction markets to offer election contracts. Brokers entered the fray, too. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and Robinhood (HOOD) each launched election betting markets last month; Interactive Brokers this week said that more than 220 million contracts had been placed on the presidential election as of the end of Tuesday. Election betting has faced backlash from regulators, who earlier this year proposed a rule that would explicitly prohibit the trading of election contracts — and from election watchers who cited concern that market participants could seek to influence an election for financial gain. Regulators have appealed last month's ruling in favor of Kalshi.      ",

Equity desks in the region's financial centres reported little panic as voters ushered Trump back into office on a platform of tax cuts and protectionism - a contrast to sharp declines in European auto and renewable stocks. \"We saw gradual buying continue to pick up,\" said Shinji Ogawa, co-head of Japan cash equities sales at J.P. Morgan in Tokyo of trade on Thursday, with investors choosing industrials and financials. \"There are a few narratives that don't necessarily allow the 'Trump trade' to dictate everything,\" he said, pointing out rate rises on the horizon in Japan and a policy meeting in China this week expected to approve measures to boost the economy. To be sure, the investment playbook derived from Trump's first term has been to buy U.S. stocks and their performance has drawn money out of Hong Kong and in to the S&P 500, dealers said. But those with global mandates or wishing to diversify are sticking with the Asia bets they have, following a bit of a drawdown - mostly out of India - through October. \"With this environment where cost of dollar capital is unlikely to fall that much...then you're likely to see a lot more preference for growth,\" said Ken Peng, head of Asia investment strategy at Citi Wealth in Hong Kong. \"So India is going to continue to do that.\" A bounce in Japanese automaker stocks and a surge in banks and shares of heavy machinery firms, sensitive to capital expenditure, showed buyers' focus there. In Vietnam, shares in industrial park owner Becamex leapt in anticipation of firms expanding manufacturing while developer Kinh Bac City, which has a golf and hotel project with Trump's private conglomerate, hit its upward trading limit. BETTER PREPARED In Trump's first term, China bore the brunt of his aggressive trade policy, and growth and the yuan took a hit. This time around, investors think they know a little more about what to expect from Trump and say China is better prepared. \"China is now better prepared for any curbs, whether technologically, militarily, or financially,\" said Charles Wang, chairman of Shenzhen Dragon Pacific Capital Management Co.

Companies like CoreCivic and Geo Group may be known for profiting from the growing population of incarcerated Americans, but they struck gold after expanding into the operation of detention centers for undocumented migrants on behalf of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Now investors are betting heavily their earnings are set to soar, bidding up shares on Wednesday in the aftermath of Trump’s election. Stock in CoreCivic surged 29% while Geo Group saw an even bigger gain, vaulting 42% in a single session. While Trump and his allies have long attacked the Democratic Party for being too soft on crime and too soft on borders, it was Elon Musk—himself an immigrant—who made the issue of illegal migration the core argument why he was spending millions in a risky gamble to return Trump to the White House. The centibillionaire and owner of X repeatedly claimed Democrats were deliberately opening the floodgates on the southern border, strategically funneling Latino migrants from countries like Venezuela to battleground states where they would be granted asylum and put on a fast track to citizenship. In exchange, he warned, the grateful newly naturalized Americans would then vote for the Democrats, eventually turning the whole of the country into a Democratic stronghold like California. (However, exit polls indicate Latino men were the single biggest demographic to swing from Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024.) “If Trump doesn’t win, this will be the last real election in America,” Musk told Joe Rogan on Election Day, during which Rogan endorsed Trump. “They will legalize enough illegals to turn the swing states and everywhere will be like California. There will be no escape.” With Musk likely to wield considerable influence in the next administration, the market now expects companies like CoreCivic and Geo Group to profit. Investors betting on a boom in ICE-related profits have good reason. During the Trump administration, the federal government expanded its immigration detention system by over 50%, a move that “overwhelmingly benefitted private prison companies”, according to findings from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The number of migrants detained reached a peak of 55,000 in 2019. It didn’t end with Biden’s election either. Even though he immediately issued an executive order ending private prison contracts with the federal government when he took office in January 2021, Biden made one exception—migrant detention facilities.

The dominant AI chipmaker's shares rose 2.2%, lifted by broad investor optimism about tax cuts and lower regulations after the Republican candidate's Tuesday election victory. Nvidia's stock market value ended the day at $3.65 trillion, beating Apple's record closing market capitalization of $3.57 trillion reached on Oct. 21, before the chipmaker on Tuesday overtook the iPhone maker as the world's most valuable company, according to LSEG data. Apple's stock rose 2.1% on Thursday, leaving it with a market value of $3.44 trillion. The S&P 500 technology index has surged over 4% in the two sessions since Trump won the election on Tuesday. Nvidia has been the U.S. stock market's biggest winner from a race between Microsoft, Alphabet and other heavyweights to build out their AI computing capacity and dominate the emerging technology. The Silicon Valley chip designer's stock has climbed 12% in November, with its value tripling so far in 2024. Following this year's surge, Nvidia now exceeds the combined value of Eli Lilly, Walmart, JPMorgan, Visa, UnitedHealth Group and Netflix. Analysts on average see Nvidia increasing its quarterly revenue by over 80% to $32.9 billion when it reports its results on Nov. 20, according to LSEG. In June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company before it was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months. Microsoft's market value stood at nearly $3.16 trillion, with its stock up 1.25% on Thursday. (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) ",

Wall Street goes into Friday at record peaks, helping to pull MSCI's gauge of global equities to an all-time high with a 3.3% weekly advance. Even a market you might expect to be languishing under the weight of Donald Trump's proposed tariffs - China - is doing nothing of the sort. Chinese blue chips are up close to 6% this week, with more than half of that coming on Thursday, perhaps on expectations of a Beijing stimulus bazooka to counter the impact of any trade war. But markets have repeatedly been let down in recent weeks after bubbling up in anticipation of bold Chinese stimulus measures. The Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress wraps up its week-long session in the Beijing evening with a news conference that could pump up - or pop - expectations. Stock futures are pointing about 0.2% higher for Britain's FTSE and Germany's DAX right now, but Europe faces challenges, not least from the threat of blanket tariffs under Trump. The FTSE has sagged this week, particularly on Thursday after the Bank of England signalled the risk of higher inflation, slowing the likely pace of interest rate cuts. Germany looks closer to a snap election, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's approach to the leader of the opposition conservatives, Friedrich Merz, was not only rebuffed, but had Merz calling for an immediate vote of no confidence. Scholz's awkward three-way coalition fell apart on Wednesday after he sacked finance minister Christian Lindner of the fiscally conservative Free Democrats at the culmination of long-running budget disputes. Any signs of resolution would be welcomed by investors, who sent one measure of debt risk to a record level on Thursday.

In other words, assets that had rallied in anticipation of a Trump win kept on pushing higher, while those that had weakened accelerated their fall, signaling that a victory hadn’t been fully priced into the market. It also reflected relief that the election had produced a clear outcome. ‘I’m devastated she didn’t win’: I voted for Kamala Harris.

MarketWatch Live: Trump wins presidency as Republicans take Senate; House hangs in balance “Markets hate uncertainty and now that the election is officially over, stocks are soaring today. Optimism over tax cuts, a still-dovish Fed, and a potentially better economy are part of it, but the reality is the economy has been quite solid all year, so this really isn’t anything new,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, in an email. “Back to your regularly scheduled bull market is how we see it.” The question for investors is what happens once the postelection euphoria wears off. Here’s a look at how individual assets fared the day after the election. Much like after Trump’s 2016 victory, stocks soared. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose more than 1,500 points, or 3.6%, for its biggest post–Election Day percentage gain since 1896, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 SPX jumped 2.5%, its biggest gain on the day after an election on record, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP rose 3%. All three indexes ended at records. Republicans took majority control of the Senate, while it remained unclear if they would keep control of the House. A Trump victory, particularly if accompanied by a Republican sweep of Congress, was viewed in the run-up to the election as the most bullish scenario for U.S. stocks — with Trump calling for a further cut in the tax rate on corporate profits, after seeing it lowered to 21% from 35% in his first term, as well as personal tax cuts.

Even as the broader market rallied to record highs on Wednesday, with stocks having their best day since 2022, investors fled renewables after America picked the “drill, baby, drill\" candidate. But while many see Trump as a scourge for clean energy, some analysts believe the market has overreacted—and that quality stocks in the sector can be had at a bargain. One reason is that, while Trump has lambasted the environmental provisions in President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as the “Green New Scam,\" it is unlikely to repealed. This is not least because the law, which included billions in subsidies for renewables, has contributed to a clean energy boom in several red states, particularly when it comes to wind and solar projects. Jay Hatfield, the CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, believes the act will be modified, but he said existing providers should not have much to worry about. “There's going to be sensible development of wind and solar,” he told Fortune. “Is there a catalyst for people to all of a sudden get excited about it? Probably not, but it's too cheap and it's over-shorted.” The world, he said, simply needs more power than any one energy source can provide. That’s been apparent during the AI boom, which has thrust utility stocks — traditionally seen as boring, defensive plays — into the spotlight as tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon exhibit ravenous demand for power needed to fuel their data centers. Morningstar energy analyst Brett Castelli also said the post-election sell-off has created opportunities. “Structural drivers, such as technological advancements, cost declines, and state renewable energy policies, ensure the energy transition will continue regardless of which party is in the White House,” he wrote in a note Wednesday. One company Castelli highlighted was First Solar, which saw its stock fall 10% on Wednesday before it traded relatively flat Thursday. The Arizona-based solar panel manufacturer, he said, might even benefit from some of Trump’s protectionist trade policies. Hatfield, meanwhile, is a fan of Florida’s NextEra Energy, the country’s largest renewables developer. The company's shares dropped 5% on Wednesday, but they have held relatively steady since. While not a single Republican voted for Biden's 2017 green energy legislation, several right-wing lawmakers have warmed up to some of its provisions. A group of 18 House Republicans, for example, recently sent Speaker Mike Johnson a letter cautioning that some of the bill's incentives have created jobs and boosted investment in their districts.

It fell 0.5% in the previous session. A key gauge of Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong closed 2.5% higher. China’s currency also flipped to gains, even after the country’s central bank slashed its daily reference rate to a level unseen since late 2023. The onshore yuan rose as much as 0.3% versus the dollar in the afternoon, reversing a 0.2% decline as state banks sold the greenback. Optimism is growing that authorities may announce stronger stimulus measures after a key legislature meeting concludes on Friday, which would help cushion any blow from potential tariffs threatened by President-elect Donald Trump. Sentiment also got a boost as data showed China’s export growth surged in October to the fastest since July 2022, exceeding economists’ forecasts. “The logic is Trump tariff will trigger bigger stimulus,” said Siguo Chen, portfolio manager at RBC BlueBay Asset Management. “I think actual support will come later than expected. No point using up all the bullets before Trump gets in office.” Trump’s return to power is seen complicating Beijing’s efforts to revive the economy and lift market sentiment through a series of stimulus measures that began late September. Therefore, the ongoing legislature meeting has become all the more crucial for investors. Showing a sense of urgency, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday repeated a call for officials to step up efforts in the remaining two months of the year, so as to meet the nation’s annual economic targets. In another sign of policy support, Chinese regulators told the nation’s banks to lower the rates they pay on deposits from other financial institutions to free up funds to boost the economy, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter. “Cutting interbank deposit rates would not bring too much impact on the economy, but PBOC continues to give a signal that they will maintain a supportive monetary policy stance,” said Jason Chan, senior investment strategist at Bank of East Asia. --With assistance from Charlotte Yang and Wenjin Lv.

Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The market was positioned for short-end rates to fall and unwound those trades after the government unveiled its fiscal plans, Governor Andrew Bailey told reporters at a press conference following Thursday’s monetary policy decision. That dynamic is “probably finished now,” he said. Bailey later said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that he briefed Chancellor Rachel Reeves of a potential market reaction ahead of her announcement of plans to run up borrowing and boost investments. He said that the investor wobble that followed “wasn’t surprising.” “There was some closing out of positions in sterling,” Bailey said in the press conference. “But if you look at the market today it’s pretty settled.” UK bonds tumbled last week, with the yield on two-year notes rising more than 25 basis points, as traders worried the government’s increased spending in the coming years will fan inflation and limit the BOE’s ability to ease monetary policy. Last week, Bloomberg reported that the selloff in front-end bonds deepened as investors were stopped out of trades that would benefit from a steeper yield curve. Strategies for gilts to outperform other bond markets were also unwound. Bailey, who along with the Monetary Policy Committee decided to cut rates by a quarter point on Thursday, said the selloff was made worse by stop-loss orders being triggered. He added that there was a reluctance in the market to take on active positions while the outcome of the US presidential election was unknown. Still, the moves were far more orderly than the reaction to former prime minister Liz Truss’s fiscal plans in 2022, which triggered a rout in long bonds exacerbated by leveraged pension fund strategies. “We’re tracking the gilt market,” BOE deputy governor Dave Ramsden said. “We work closely with the Debt Management Office but we’re not seeing anything unusual at all at the moment.” On Thursday, 10-year gilts were on course for the first gain this week. The yield fell six basis points to 4.51%. The pound also got a boost, rallying as much as 1% to above $1.30 amid a broadly weaker US dollar.

CPI data has been slightly sticky above the Fed's 2% target, with the latest report showing inflation cooled in September but less than economists had expected. The labor market, on the other hand, appears to be a smaller source of stress for the Fed, but Powell said it's \"prepared to adjust the pace and destination\" of easing as the jobs data evolves. \"There seems to be less anxiety about the risk of rising unemployment and slowing job growth,\" Fitch Ratings chief economist Brian Coulton said in a Thursday note. The latest employment data, released Thursday, shows weekly jobless claims increased slightly to 221,000, a gain of 3,000 from the week before and in line with expectations. Investors seem hopeful Trump's light regulatory stance and proposals for corporate tax cuts will make for a more friendly business environment. Evercore ISI this week predicted the S&P 500 to jump 11% by next summer as the rally accelerates in Trump's second term.             ",

        "body": "(Reuters) -Qualcomm shares rose 4% on Thursday after the chip designer's strong quarterly revenue forecast fanned investor optimism about a China-led recovery in the smartphone market. The company, the biggest supplier of smartphone chips, will add around $8 billion to its market value, if the gains hold. It forecast both first-quarter sales and adjusted profit above market estimates on Wednesday, signaling the smartphone market was picking up after a tough 2023 as consumers upgrade devices for AI apps such as chatbots and image generators. Demand has been especially positive in major market China, from which Qualcomm gets nearly half its revenue, thanks to new smartphone launches by brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. \"This was a nice sign that the consumer was willing to spend on high-end cell phones,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. \"Improvement in the Chinese market played a big role. Can that continue is the big question for investors.\" Qualcomm is trying to diversify its revenue as it braces for the end of a lucrative tie-up with Apple, which is working on its own modem chips to replace those made by Qualcomm. While the deal to keep selling chips to Apple is until at least 2026, focus is on whether Qualcomm's efforts to break into laptops and artificial intelligence in data centers will ramp up quickly enough to offset declines in Apple revenue. \"Qualcomm is starting to enjoy additional revenue from the other markets it is focusing on including automotive, internet of things, headsets and PCs,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. President-elect Donald Trump has floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10% to 20% on virtually all imports as well as tariffs of 60% or more on goods from China, in a bid to boost U.S. manufacturing. \"Higher tariffs, if they are applied to chips from Taiwan, which I would be very surprised if they happen ... that would be an incentive for Qualcomm to move manufacturing stateside,\" said O'Donnell.

        "body": "Dentsply Sirona Inc. (NASDAQ:XRAY) shares are trading lower on Thursday. The company reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents, beating the street view of 47 cents. Quarterly sales of $951 million (increased 0.5%) outpaced the analyst consensus estimate of $939.10 million. The company recorded a $495 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. This was due to ongoing economic challenges, legislative changes affecting Byte, weaker demand, increased competition in implants, and lower expected lab material volumes. Segment wise, Connected Technology Solutions fell 2.3%, Essential Dental Solutions gained 6.6%, Orthodontic and Implant Solutions slumped 4.6%, while Wellspect Healthcare fell 0.4%. Also Read: Steve Madden Q3 Earnings Top Estimates As Revenue Jumps 13%, Lifts 2024 Outlook Quarterly adjusted EBITDA fell 1.8% to $170 million. Adjusted EBITDA Margin contracted to 17.9% from 18.3% in the quarter under review. “Third quarter organic growth was driven by favorable timing in Essential Dental Solutions of approximately $20 million related to stocking orders in anticipation of U.S. ERP deployment, and higher sales in CAD/CAM, which benefited from the launch of our new scanner, Primescan 2,” said Simon Campion, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Due to ongoing market pressures impacting equipment in the U.S., as well as the evolving landscape with Byte, we are lowering our full year organic sales outlook,” Campion added. The company had $296 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30. Long-term debt as of quarter end totaled $1.795 billion. Guidance: Dentsply Sirona revised its 2024 outlook due to market pressures impacting U.S. equipment, legislative changes affecting the direct-to-consumer aligner business model, and the voluntary suspension of sales, marketing, and shipments of Byte Aligners and Impression Kits. The revised sales forecast is $3.79 billion – $3.83 billion, versus prior guidance of $3.86 billion – $3.90 billion and consensus of $3.878 billion, with an organic sales decline of 3.5% – 2.5% year over year. The company expects 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.82 – $1.86 versus prior guidance of $1.96 – $2.02 and consensus of $1.98. William Blair noted that some negative events have affected the stock since upgrading Dentsply Sirona last year. However, the firm still believes the stock offers an appealing risk-to-reward balance for a leading dental company with broad capabilities and strong potential in a promising market.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- ANZ Group Holdings Ltd.’s profit missed estimates as Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliott said competition in the mortgage market remained intense. Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Cash profit slipped to A$6.73 billion ($4.5 billion) in the 12 months to Sept. 30, from A$7.41 billion the previous year, the Melbourne-based lender said in a statement Friday. That compared with the A$6.81 billion average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The result points to the challenge for the nation’s biggest banks, which are losing the benefits of the high interest rate cycle. With rates potentially poised to fall next year in Australia, that could weigh on margins and intensify the battle for home loans. Consumer banking is facing a “massive profit challenge,” Elliott told analysts on a call on Friday, for which the only solution is technology simplifications such as its ANZ Plus app that can make the bank a quicker and cheaper competitor. “Competition and rate cycle uncertainties represent a challenge for the banking sector,” he said. ANZ is also contending with an investigation by the nation’s securities regulator into the trading of government bonds, while traders earlier this year departed the bank amid allegations of misconduct. “We are expediting the work we have underway to improve our non-financial risk practices,” Elliott said. “This, along with continuing to drive a strong speak-up culture, is a key focus of mine as CEO — as well as across the bank more broadly.” The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in August imposed an increased risk buffer on ANZ’s capital due to the bank’s weaknesses in non-financial risk management. Elliott said Friday he didn’t expect that to be reduced again over the next financial year. In its Australian retail business, the firm said home loans grew 7%, as did customer deposits. Its institutional unit saw strong growth in operational deposits and markets revenue came in at A$2.2 billion, up 4% on last year. Hardship Support “Higher interest rates are impacting customers and we saw an increase in those requiring hardship support,” Elliott said. “Our data shows customers, in general, are holding up better than expected.” Analysts highlighted the risk to margins and the dividend next year. Profit for the bank might fall another 15%, which would limit payouts to shareholders, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior industry analyst Matt Ingram.           ",

Germany’s DAX slipped 0.1% to 19,362,32. In Paris, the CAC 40 edged 0.1% lower to 7,417.13. Britain’s FTSE 100 also fell 0.1%, to 8,132.48. The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were virtually unchanged. Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell as investors awaited much-anticipated steps by Beijing to rev up the slowing Chinese economy following a meeting of the legislature’s Standing Committee. “If Beijing delivers, we might see a powerful rally ripple through the region as investors gear up for a fresh surge in market momentum,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Officials announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion), three-year plan to help local governments refinance their many trillions of debt that has ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic and a collapse of the property market. Hong Kong's Hang Seng erased early gains, falling 1.1% to 20,728.19. The Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.5% to 3,452.30. Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.3% to 39,500.37. Shares in Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Corp. plummeted 6% on Friday after the company on Thursday announced that it will dismiss 9,000 workers and slash its global production capacity by 20% due to falling sales and rising costs and inventory. In South Korea, the Kospi shed 0.1% to 2,561.15, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.8% to 8,295.10. On Thursday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.7%, adding to its surge from the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. The Fed’s announcement that it was easing its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point caused few ripples in the market because even the precise size of it was so well anticipated by investors. The central bank began easing rates in September and indicated more cuts were likely to come, as it focuses more on keeping the job market humming after helping get inflation nearly down to its 2% target. What’s less certain in the minds of investors now is how much Trump’s victory may upset the Fed’s plans. Trump is pushing for tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation higher, along with the economy’s growth. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.         ",

Noted as part of its third quarter (Q3) earnings report, the company cited operating losses and negative cash flows since the company’s inception as the reason for the low cash reserves. The French biotech’s lead candidate, peanut allergy treatment Viaskin Peanut, has till date failed to secure US regulatory approval. DBV noted that it intends to “seek additional capital as it continues research and development (R&D) efforts and prepares for the launch of Viaskin Peanut if approved.” While cautioning its investors that the company could not guarantee that it could secure financing at favourable terms, if at all. Adding DBV may need to scale back operations, by delaying or reducing its R&D operations, or may relinquish the rights to its pipeline candidates, if it fails to secure financing. DBV’s stock dropped by more than 8.17% in trading today (7 November) on the Euronext market. The company reported cash reserves of $46.4m as of 30 September, down by $92.2m from the cash on hand it had at the end of last year (31 December 2023). DBV noted that the funds were primarily directed towards clinical trial activity for Viaskin Peanut. In April 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that although DBV’s peanut allergy patch successfully met the primary endpoints in the Phase III EPITOPE trial (NCT03211247) in toddlers (aged one to three years), an additional safety study is required for approval. The Viaskin patch’s approval process has been a tumultuous one. In 2017, the allergy path failed to meet its primary endpoint in the Phase III PEPITES clinical trial (NCT02636699) in children aged 4-11 years. The company’s second attempt at Phase III VITESSE trial (NCT05741476) in a more narrowed age group of 4-7 years suffered a setback when the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the study in September 2022. The hold has since been lifted and the company expects to share topline data from the study in Q4 2025. Following the back and forth with the FDA, DBV plans to pursue Viaskin Peanut’s approval in toddlers in the US and children aged one to seven years in Europe. LAst month, the company noted that as part of the accelerated approval pathway, the FDA requires additional safety data. DBV plans to start an additional safety study, COMFORT Toddlers, evaluating Viaskin Peanut in approximately 250 toddlers in Q2 2025. The company also plans to start a COMFORT Children, a safety study in four-to-seven-year-olds in Q2 2025. The trial is expected to enrol 250 participants.       ",

Recommended Reading Adidas momentum continues with 7% sales growth As CEO Kevin Plank implements his turnaround strategy at Under Armour, the retailer’s revenue continues to tumble. In the second quarter, the metric was down 11% year over year to $1.4 billion, with North America revenue falling 13%. Both wholesale and DTC sales declined meaningfully in the quarter, the latter due in part to lower promotions in Under Armour’s online business. Net income, on the other hand, surged nearly 63% to $170 million, per a company press release. Much of the brand’s turnaround strategy focuses on repositioning its brand, and Plank said on a call with analysts Thursday that 2025 will not only see improved product, but also the company’s most significant marketing effort to date. Although sales are still dropping at Under Armour, that is partially due to purposeful steps the brand is taking to decrease promotions and (hopefully) create a more premium business as a result. “This playbook of sacrificing low-quality sales in exchange for a stronger brand position and higher prices is one that we have seen play out at other retailers and, by and large, it can be extremely palatable to investors,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. The question, though, is how much of the declines are purposeful, according to Saunders, who added that Under Armour still has an “extensive amount of work” to do in order to rebuild brand equity. Part of that journey involves cozying back up to its wholesale partners, with Plank telling analysts the company plans to increase communication with its key retailers and work to earn more shelf space. “We don’t have as much shelf space as we once had and it’s our job to earn that, season by season,” Plank said. While that is important, Saunders warned that Under Armour also needs to take a critical eye to how it shows up at wholesale partners, including the likes of Kohl’s, where the brand often shows up poorly. The other half of the coin is reengaging the consumer. To that end, Plank said Under Armour plans to be “an incredibly loud brand and quiet company” going forward (something the brand has promised before as well), and is gearing up for a big marketing effort next year. The addition of longtime Adidas veteran Eric Liedtke to head up brand strategy in August this year is already driving “tangible, brand-right changes to improve our positioning in the market,” according to Plank, and the company’s product pipeline is “as healthy as I’ve seen it,” he said.

Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow During his first term, Donald Trump’s incessant tweets were a must-read for Wall Street types, whether they liked it or not. He would crow when the stock market went up, blast Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when it went down (“Where did I find this guy Jerome?”), bully CEOs who irked him and threaten to slap tariffs and sanctions on countries around the world. Anytime, day or night, policymaking via Twitter — which has been rebranded as X — became the norm, hacked out in staccato bursts to his millions of followers. These musings would often trigger sudden market swings, upending in the process the work and sleep schedules of traders and investors across financial markets. “I remember being perpetually on edge that something could happen at any time,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, of Trump’s first term. Now with Trump storming back to reclaim the White House after Tuesday’s vote, Sosnick and the rest of Wall Street are bracing for a redux of it all, with posts on his Truth Social platform and more. That’s because no president in modern history intertwined his fortunes so closely to the financial markets. Nor has any leader of the free world so publicly made rising stock prices such a crucial barometer of his success. Just on market moves alone, Trump tweeted at least 100 times while in office, including mentions of the “Dow,” “Nasdaq,” “bull run,” “earnings” and “winning streak,” data compiled by Bloomberg show. Joe Biden, in keeping with past presidents, has done the same only a handful of times on the site, including this year when the S&P 500 first crossed 5,000. “We’re basically now going back to a situation where you’re susceptible to hearing almost anything,” Sosnick said. Trump swept to a decisive win this week, spurring more gyrations across asset classes. The S&P 500 vaulted to an all-time high while small caps had their best day in two years. Bond yields and the dollar surged as traders fretted higher tariffs and fiscal spending would revive inflation and snarl trade. Despite their contrasting approaches, returns have differed little across administrations. The S&P 500 rose 64% following Trump’s 2016 win through Biden’s victory in November 2020. Under Biden, the market has risen 69%. But Trump’s propensity to tweet about markets was a signature of his presidency. In December 2019, when the Dow hit a high, he tweeted that he’d “never get bored of telling you that.” Wall Street is bracing for more.                 ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The onshore CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) closed down 1% Friday. The benchmark rose 5.5% for the week, its best showing in about a month. A gauge of Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong also dropped nearly 1% at 3:37 p.m. local time. The focus is now on a briefing later Friday by the budget committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s equivalent of parliament, and the Finance Ministry on a plan to allow local governments to refinance their off-balance-sheet debt. Whether policymakers will also use the occasion to announce additional fiscal spending will be of keen interest to investors. The briefing comes as top legislators conclude a week-long meeting, a gathering that investors have hoped for authorities to roll out stronger economic support to counter the threat of tariffs under a second Donald Trump presidency. New stimulus measures may renew optimism that emerged Thursday after October’s robust exports helped offset concerns over slow investment growth and weak consumption. “Although the threat of more tariffs looms with Trump 2.0, it may also accelerate China’s stimulus rollout, with China putting more of the dry fiscal powder to use now that the election result is confirmed,” said Marvin Chen, a Bloomberg Intelligence strategist. The prospect of an expanded trade war during the US president-elect’s second term — even if it falls short of the threatened 60% tariff — is raising expectations for greater stimulus going into next year, as China braces for a new era of protectionism that could put harsher constraints on trade. Such expectations have rekindled China’s stock rally, which lost steam in recent weeks following an initial surge in late September that came on the back of the central bank’s stimulus blitz. The CSI 300 surged nearly 35% from a September low through Oct. 8, but has fallen about 4% since. Economists at Standard Chartered Plc (STAN.L) and Macquarie (MQG.AX) project China’s growth would suffer a hit of as much as two percentage points should Trump follow through on his campaign vow to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 60%. Showing a sense of urgency, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday repeated a call for officials to step up efforts in the remaining two months of the year, so as to meet the nation’s annual economic targets.

        "body": "Donald Trump won decisively in the U.S. presidential election and the U.S. bond market celebrated by falling, at least in the immediate aftermath of the news. The market’s reaction suggests that many investors are expecting a more inflationary environment as a result of the Trump administration’s second-term policies. The benchmark 10-year Treasury rate rose by as much as 18 basis points the day after the election, pushing the overall rate on the bond to 4.47 percent. The price of bonds and their yield move inversely, with prices falling as rates rise. A rising yield on Treasurys raises the cost of the U.S. federal government when it borrows new money or rolls over existing debts. Many investors expect that the federal government under Trump will maintain high deficit spending amid accommodative rate policy from the Federal Reserve. So, many are selling their bonds or actively betting against bonds in advance of any further rises in long-term rates. Trump has promised a litany of things on the campaign trail – revamped immigration policy, a raise in tariffs, further tax cuts – each of which could aid in increasing inflation. Whether any of these things comes to pass is still anyone’s guess. But Trump and federal legislators have one thing that they will likely act on next year: a renewal of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, the so-called Trump tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. The Trump tax cuts contributed to annual budget deficits significantly, helping lead to spiraling federal debt, which now totals around $36 trillion. Significant spending under the Biden administration, including for COVID relief, added further to that debt. Many experts foresee the Trump tax cuts being extended, leaving the U.S. with a still-gaping hole in its finances if spending remains the same. “A temporary extension is the more likely outcome” than a permanent extension, says Michael Wronsky, a director at Baker Tilly’s Washington tax council practice. He notes that this assumes “Republicans retain control of the House of Representatives.” As federal debt rises to higher levels and costs more of the annual budget to service, investors demand to be compensated for higher risk, such as the risk of rising inflation eating away at the value of a fixed rate of return on the debt. Paying interest on the debt has also grown to become a huge expense on its own, eating up $1.049 trillion in the latest fiscal year, up 30 percent from the year before, according to the Treasury Department. That expense is not paid off but simply rolled over, adding even more to the total debt.                 ",

        "body": "Shares of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) settled higher on Wednesday after Donald Trump won the election to become the 47th U.S. president. The Biden administration imposed an artificial intelligence technology embargo on China, restricting the country's access to sophisticated AI chips from Nvidia, citing national security threats. With the recent buzz around Nvidia ahead of quarterly earnings, some investors may also be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Nvidia offers an annual dividend yield of 0.03%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 1 cent per share (4 cents a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Nvidia, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Nvidia's 4 cent dividend: $6,000 / $0.04 = 150,000 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $21,841,500 worth of Nvidia, or 150,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.04 = 30,000 shares, or $4,368,300 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time. That can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. NVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained by 4.1% to close at $145.61 on Wednesday.

        "body": "Shares of companies with ties to Russia have rallied since Trump won the US election. Russia-linked stocks have struggled since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. There is some optimism that Trump will help arrange a deal to end the war. Stocks tied to Russia have risen since Donald Trump won the US presidential election as investors hope that he follows through on campaign rhetoric on bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. Raiffeisen Bank International, an Austrian bank, has seen its stock surge 12.2% to a seven-month high since the market closed on Tuesday. Hungary-based OTP Bank soared 4.9% in that time. Both banks have operations in Russia. Turkey-based construction firm Enka Insaat, meanwhile, is up 8.6% since Tuesday. Shares of companies with ties to Russia plunged following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, as investors fled the country over fears that sanctions would hobble the economy and hurt firms doing business there. After the invasion, the US and Europe employed widespread sanctions to cut off the Kremlin's war revenue. The moves forced many companies to exit the country and made doing business difficult for those that remained. The debt market has also responded to Trump's win, with Ukraine's dollar-denominated bonds rallying since the election. On Wednesday, bonds tied to Ukraine's GDP soared to their highest level since before the war began. Investors are hoping that Trump will follow through on pledges made during his campaign to help end the war in Ukraine, which has been going on for nearly three years. During his debate against Vice President Kamala Harris in September, Trump promised to settle the war even before becoming president and said he would speak to both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to work out a deal. In July, he said he could end the conflict in less than a day. Recent reports say Trump's advisors have set out plans to end the war with approaches like a demilitarized zone between the two countries. Analysts, though, have voiced concerns that Putin has more to gain from prolonging the war than ending it, posing a challenge to any dealmaking efforts by Trump. In a post on X, Zelenskyy congratulated the president-elect and appeared hopeful his term could change the war's trajectory. \"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer,\" Zelenskyy wrote. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

With decades of combined experience, these two business leaders joined forces to create an agency uniquely equipped to navigate the complexities of multicultural marketing. “The mission of Black Girl Digital is really about how we pull the brand and the creators closer together to go beyond the partnership and build a deeper relationship,” Shambo tells BLACK ENTERPRISE. The pair first met while collaborating on the 2023 Black Girl Digital Awards. While many speak of the competition among women in business, Shambo and Bond saw an opportunity to merge their strengths and platforms. “We were going through the process of working together and I was seeing her talent, she was seeing my talent. We recognized that we both have these unique skills that work really well together,” Shambo shares. By blending Black Girl Digital’s expertise in influencer marketing with The BBM Agency’s strength in celebrity business management, BGD Media is exceptionally equipped to tackle the intricacies of multicultural marketing. “With her company doing more of the paid marketing, brand management, and communication strategy, it really complemented what we did on the Black Girl Digital side with the corporate brand partnerships and diverse creators,” Shambo explains. “And together, we were able to come together and offer full-service media and marketing opportunities for our brands and creators so that the partnership just goes deeper and it’s not surface level.” Shambo credits BGD Media’s success to their service offering of multi-marketing tiers that “brings the client closer to the creator and the creator closer to the client.” One of its latest initiatives is the inaugural Black Influencer Weekend, designed to showcase for major brands and corporations how Black creators not only set trends but also drive meaningful cultural and economic shifts across industries.

        "body": "Chinese electric vehicle (EV) firms are expected to maintain their competitive edge in the European Union (EU) market, despite new tariffs, reported South China Morning Post. Industry officials at the China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai highlighted the production and pricing advantages that make Chinese EVs appealing globally. Speaking at the CIIE, Ford Motor China CEO Sam Wu emphasised that Chinese carmakers' expertise in EV manufacturing can be replicated in other markets. “The Chinese EV industry is in the pole position thanks to an early start and government support,” Wu stated. The EU recently voted to impose additional tariffs on Chinese-made pure-electric cars, ranging from 17% to 35.3%, following an anti-subsidy investigation. These tariffs are in addition to the standard 10% tariff. However, some international carmakers believe their Chinese-made EVs can still thrive in the EU market. Chery Automobile chairman Yin Tongyue noted the importance of integrating into the global supply chain for Chinese carmakers' success. “Chinese EV makers could not make rapid progress from the very beginning if we were not able to access the best technologies and the global automotive supply chain,” he was quoted as saying by the publication. “I think synergy with global partners and sustainability are the keywords for the Chinese players as we try to maintain our advantages.” Meanwhile, Xpeng, a premium EV maker, is in talks with European dealers to address the tariff challenges. Other global players such as Volkswagen and BMW, which manufacture some vehicles in China with partners like SAIC Motor and Brilliance Auto, are also subject to EU tariffs. Volkswagen and BMW are also facing penalties for their vehicles manufactured in mainland China, as these are assembled in collaboration with local partners, including state-owned companies such as SAIC Motor and Brilliance Auto. SAIC faces the highest tariff rate at 35.3%, while Geely Auto is subject to an 18.8% rate. Other Chinese carmakers will absorb a 20.7% tariff. In response, China has urged France to facilitate a resolution beneficial to both Chinese and European EV sectors. Additionally, China has also advised its auto manufacturers to halt significant investments in EU countries supporting the additional tariffs on Chinese-built EVs. \"EU tariffs unlikely to deter Chinese EVs from entering market \" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "body": "By Milana Vinn, Echo Wang and Nupur Anand NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street executives cheered the prospect of business-friendly regulations and a burst of deals as they analyzed the implications of Donald Trump's reelection, although some felt uneasy about his unpredictability. Trump's return to power is likely to significantly ease some regulatory pressures under the Biden administration, executives across banks and private equity said. Smaller government, broad deregulation and tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy are widely expected. In particular, a softer antitrust stance and less regulation in areas such as banking and cryptocurrencies could boost corporate profits and spur deal flow, they said. \"He is pro-business and anti-regulation,\" said Euan Rellie, co-founder and managing partner of investment bank BDA Partners. \"His instincts are to cut taxes. All of that will help the M&A market.\" \"So long as he governs with moderation and not with chaos, the markets will welcome him,\" said Rellie. However, some executives said that was not a given. Some bankers worried about how to navigate unpredictable shifts in government policy, the impact of trade tariffs, a potentially perilous fiscal path that adds trillions of dollars to the national debt and the potential tightening of visa programs. For now, though, the reaction was euphoric. As U.S. stocks rallied sharply, one equity capital markets banker who declined to be named said his colleagues got fresh mandates Wednesday morning and an opportunity to pitch for an initial public offering. The message was, \"Let's get the ball rolling,\" the banker said. An investment banker at a global firm in New York also said his firm had an internal call to discuss deals, including possibly revisiting some transactions that may have not passed regulatory scrutiny under Lina Khan's Federal Trade Commission in the Biden administration. MORE BUSINESS A more lenient approach to antitrust issues could boost dealmaking in many sectors. Two sources with knowledge of the media industry said the sector was in for two years of consolidation. Greg Hertrich, head of U.S. depository strategies at Nomura, projected more banking mergers. \"The current number of 4,700 banks in the U.S. may be reduced to around 2,500 faster,\" he said. Large financial deals will have more chance of being greenlighted. Shares of payments firms Capital One and Discover Financial Services, awaiting approval of a $35.3 billion deal, surged after Trump was elected.             ",

Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. The stock is down 21% over the past five days, although shares have rallied by 50% in the past month. Strategists had categorized the stock as a binary bet on the election. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts that the trajectory of shares has hinged on \"a buy the rumor, sell the fact\" trading strategy. \"I would imagine that the day after him winning, you'd see this come down,\" he predicted at the time. Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock \"life of its own.\" \"It was volatile on the way up, and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction,\" he said on a call with Yahoo Finance last week. In September, shares in Trump Media traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. The stock eventually bounced back from its lows as both domestic and overseas betting markets began to shift in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period. Last month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $31 a share, Trump Media boasted a market cap of about $6.7 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $4 billion.    ",

Wall Street cheered the results, sending the stock up 27.2% by end of market trading—Under Armour’s second-best day since its 2005 IPO. More from Sportico.com Broadcasters Lead Sports Stocks in Highlight-Filled October Adidas, Ye Settle Legal Dispute Spawned by Antisemitic Remarks A'ja Wilson's Confident Commercial Swap Plan Activated After MVP “We are a fundamentally stronger business today with increasingly better execution across key dimensions,” Kevin Plank, Under Armour CEO, said in the earnings release. “This includes more consistent marketplace discipline through meaningfully improved product, storytelling and sales leadership, which will deliver a sharper, unique approach to our brand position in the years ahead.” Plank co-founded Under Armour in 1996 and returned to the CEO chair April 1 after several quarters of bad results further dinged the once high-flying brand. Under Armour’s market cap topped $22 billion in 2015 but dipped below $3 billion this April. “Our strategy to reconstitute the Under Armour brand and establish a more premium position in the marketplace is gaining traction,” Plank said. Revenue for the three months ending Sept. 30 was $1.4 billion, down 11% from the prior year and the sixth straight quarter of declines. Earnings per share were $0.39 with adjusted EPS of $0.30 versus the consensus estimate of $0.20. The earnings beat was driven by improved gross margins and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Under Armour updated its fiscal 2025 outlook to adjusted EPS between $0.24 and $0.27, a five-cent boost from previous guidance. “[Under Armour] is demonstrating their ability to deliver margin upside through lower DTC promos and good cost control despite a very weak [North America business],” Paul Lejuez, Citi Wall Street analyst, said in a research note after the earnings release. Lejuez added that he still sees upside to management’s raised 2025 EPS guidance. In addition to Plank, other top executives joined the Baltimore-based brand in 2024, including Yassine Saidi as chief product officer and Eric Liedtke as executive vice president of brand strategy. North America is Under Armour’s biggest market, representing more than 60% of sales, and it continues to be a challenging region for the brand, as it has been for Adidas and Nike recently.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders braced for the possibility of more bond sales in Germany after a government figurehead for fiscal conservatives was sacked, leading some in the market to contemplate a new administration that could be more tolerant of higher debt. Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow A widely-watched gauge of angst about bond supply rose, with the German 10-year yield climbing above the equivalent swap rate for the first time on record. In another sign of growing fiscal concerns, the 30-year yield jumped more than the two-year, lifting the spread toward the highest in more than two years. Chancellor Olaf Scholz opened the door to snap elections Wednesday when he fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, who is opposed to relaxing rules that severely constrain government borrowing. Lindner is known for being a strong proponent of domestic fiscal discipline and has kept a tight leash on spending since he took office in 2021. “The way toward more debt will most likely become easier without a finance minister Lindner,” Commerzbank AG strategist Hauke Siemssen wrote in a note. That helped fuel the selloff in debt, despite opinion polls suggesting fiscal conservatism might remain under a new government. The center-right alliance under opposition leader Friedrich Merz is seen leading; its stances include fierce opposition to additional joint European Union debt and supporting strict rules on new borrowing. The difference between bond yields and swap rates — the swap spread — is an important gauge of future issuance because bonds tend to weaken relative to swaps as the market anticipates more sales. Historically, the spread has been positive because governments bonds are safer than swaps, where the counterpart is typically a financial institution. But that relationship was upended Thursday, the latest leg of a long-term trend that has picked up pace across the world. The moves reflect investor fears over higher debt supply at a time when central banks are also reducing their holdings, increasing the amount markets have to digest. What Bloomberg economists say... The breakdown of the coalition probably means the 2025 budget is harder to agree. A likely dependence on fiscal hawks to form a new coalition means there is a low probability of significantly wider deficits to finance much-needed investment. It may take a deeper crisis for that to happen.                  ",

        "body": "By Kevin Buckland TOKYO (Reuters) -Asian stocks pared early gains on Friday as investors cautiously turned their focus to stimulus announcements from China later in the day with Beijing's week-long legislative meeting drawing to a close. Regional equities had started the day by tracking Wall Street's overnight rise to record highs, with investors digesting the Federal Reserve's message for careful interest rate cuts even with expectations for big fiscal spending under incoming President Donald Trump. U.S. Treasury yields pushed to new lows in Asian hours, keeping the dollar under pressure after its biggest decline versus major peers in more than six weeks on Thursday. An MSCI gauge of Asia-Pacific stocks was up 0.33% as of 0552 GMT, after earlier rising as much as 0.78%. The index remained on track for a 2.7% rally this week, after quickly recovering from a knee-jerk dip on U.S. election night, which spurred worries of debilitating trade tariffs, not least in China. Optimism for a stimulus response from Beijing kept Chinese stocks buoyed over the course of the week, including a 3% rally for mainland blue chips on Thursday. Blue chips were last down 0.5%, reversing gains of as much as 1.3% from earlier. Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.6%. The National People's Congress Standing Committee meeting concludes on Friday with officials due to hold a briefing. Sources previously told Reuters that Chinese fiscal spending could be increased in the event of a second Trump presidency. However, DBS's China economist Tao Wang doesn't expect the announcement of a full stimulus package at the briefing, as Chinese leaders need time to assess the timing and impact of any U.S. policies on the country, according to a client note. DBS's China equity strategist James Wang said Chinese stocks are \"skewed to the downside in the near term, and the market is not fully pricing in a 60% tariff implication\", the note said. Japan's Nikkei added 0.6%, up 4.1% for the week. Australia's stock benchmark climbed 0.8%, and Taiwan's benchmark gained 0.6%. South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.2%. Futures for Britain's FTSE and Germany's DAX were each up about 0.2%. The FTSE lost 0.32% on Thursday after the Bank of England signalled the risk of higher inflation. Global stocks, led by Wall Street, are on course for a 3.3% weekly advance, and stand at a record high. Trump swept back to the White House on Tuesday with Republicans taking back the Senate and potentially increasing their House majority, although votes are still being counted. The outcome defied polls that predicted a neck-and-neck race with Democrat Kamala Harris.            ",

Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The shares sank 16% after the company reported net income and other profit metrics that far trailed estimates on the back of increased investments in its credit business and logistics. Still, most analysts remained broadly positive on the long-term potential for MercadoLibre and its ability to deliver on its stated goals to grow its dominance in online retail and become one of the region’s largest financial services provider. MercadoLibre “has undergone several ‘show me’ moments in its recent history as it doubled down on some capital allocation decisions that raised questions and triggered intense stock selloffs over time,” Itau BBA analysts Rodrigo Gastim and Maria Clara Infantozzi, wrote in a report. “And the common denominator has always been its capacity to exceed return expectations, followed by strong stock bounce backs.” Even after the selloff, the Montevideo, Uruguay-based company remains Latin America’s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $89 billion, keeping its edge over Brazilian oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA. In the third quarter earnings report released late Wednesday, MELI, as its known, said its overall credit book grew by 77% from a year earlier to $6 billion, with the portion tied to credit cards surging 172% over the same period. Provisions set aside for all the lending cut into net income, which at $397 million fell short of the $513 million average estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. The company also increased investments in logistics in the quarter while inaugurating five new fulfillment centers in Brazil and another one in Mexico, Chief Financial Officer Martin de los Santos said in an interview before the release. Overall revenue met expectations at $5.3 billion. “This was a quarter of very large growth, but also investments in some of our strategic initiatives — one of which is credit,” de los Santos said. “The credit card is an important part of our fintech strategy.” While it probably adds “a little margin pressure year on year,” the company believes it’s “the right investment for the long-term growth opportunity,” he added. MercadoLibre has 25 buy recommendations, three holds and one sell, among 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Its 12-month target sits at $2,349 compared with the closing price of $1,774.                      ",

He said the market is a \"mania\" with valuations near 80-year highs. The stock market is \"entering Crazy Town\" as valuations creep toward generational highs, Stifel's chief equity strategist Barry Bannister said on Thursday. His comments come a day after the stock market soared to record highs following Donald Trump's election win, with the Dow Jones surging more than 1,500 points and the Nasdaq gaining nearly 3%. Bannister said current market valuations are pricing in an incredibly optimistic scenario that could lead to disappointment for investors. \"Even allowing for the best-case scenario of a U.S. soft landing, and despite a potential ramp higher for U.S. fiscal spending, as well as China global cyclical stimulus and lastly a geopolitical 'reckoning', the S&P 500 is a mania, nearing a 3-generation valuation high,\" Bannister said. Bannister added that while he expects the S&P 500 to reach \"the low-6,000s\" in the short term, such a move higher would result in valuations hitting 80-year highs, as measured by the cyclically adjusted S&P 500 CAPE earnings yield. \"The Earnings Yield (EPS/Price) is near the 3% low for the entire post-WW2 (since 1945) 3-generation period,\" Bannister said. According to Bannister, the extreme overvaluation suggests that even if the S&P 500 continues to rise a few percentage points to the low 6,000s in the short term, it is ripe for a 1,000-point decline, or about 13%, within a year or so. \"If S&P 500 tracks a century of manias it pops to low-6,000s in 4Q24 then round-trips to ~5,250 fair value\" by early 2026, Bannister said. The S&P 500 traded at 5,965 Thursday afternoon. Ultimately, Bannister believes that current stock market sentiment is nearing the point that typically marks the end of a bull expansion. Quoting the famed British investor Sir John Templeton, he added: \"Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria.\" Read the original article on Business Insider ",

In addition to the new boutique in Shanghai's Plaza 66 luxury mall, the company expects to open a store a year in China for the next five years, with Beijing and Chengdu the next likely locations. The shoemaker, named after its Spanish founder, had been limited in its ability to trade under its name in China after a local businessman filed trademarks related to \"Manolo Blahnik\" in 1999. China is a \"first to file\" jurisdiction which doesn't require companies to prove prior use to claim a trademark, but a ruling two years ago from the Supreme People's Court of China found in favour of the company. \"We were very, very grateful to reclaim our trademark. Before that point, we were just focused on getting it back. (Since then) we very much turned our head towards Asia,\" Chief Executive Kristina Blahnik, who is the founder's niece, said in an interview. The brand also opened two new stores in Hong Kong in October. Its long-awaited mainland China debut comes as high-end brands such as LVMH have seen sales slide in the world's second-largest luxury market, hurt by tepid economic growth and weak consumer confidence. But Blahnik said she was unconcerned as the company is just getting started in China. China's luxury footwear market is valued at about $5 billion this year and is projected to grow 7.6% a year through 2029, according to research firm Statista. Manolo Blahnik will compete with foreign brands such as Jimmy Choo and Christian Louboutin, which have the advantage of having been in China for more than a decade.

Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Official data released Thursday showed consumer prices rose 4.76% from a year prior, just above the 4.74% median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank, which holds its next rate-decision meeting on Nov. 14, targets annual inflation of 3%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and fuel, ticked down to 3.8%, below the 3.85% median estimate. The view among most analysts is that economy will down shift in the final months of the year and maintain a trend of cooler core readings going forward. Policymakers at Banco de Mexico have lowered borrowing costs at the last two meetings and are widely expected to continue the easing cycle with a third straight quarter-point cut to 10.25%, the highest among Latin America’s big economies. Analysts in the most recent Citi survey expect that Mexico’s gross domestic product will grow only 1.5% in 2024. Combined with a slowdown in the US, it may provide the central bank with more leeway for easing. What Bloomberg Economics Says “With core inflation slowing in line with central bank forecasts and activity and domestic demand moderating, policymakers are likely to look through the higher headline print. We expect another interest-rate cut next week and forward guidance to signal more if data warrant.

Meanwhile, livestock prices fell 0.18%, the statistics agency said. The peso has whipsawed since Donald Trump clinched a second term this week. The president-elect has promised to slap steep tariffs on Mexico’s goods if the government doesn’t stem migration headed toward the US border. The swings so far are unlikely to alter central banker’s plans, said Carlos Capistran, chief economist for Canada and Mexico at Bank of America Securities. “Core inflation well below 4.0% means that Banxico will continue cutting despite currency volatility,” he wrote in a research note.

China has been preparing for a second Trump term, but is limited in what it can do in a trade war. China's stock markets climbed higher on Thursday following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. The rise comes despite campaign pledges from Trump, a China hawk, to slap a 10% blanket tariff on all imported goods. He has threatened tariffs of more than 60% on Chinese goods. On Thursday, China shares rose with the benchmark CSI 300 Index, closing 3% higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed 2% up. Market sentiment was buoyant amid hopes for news of a stimulus plan from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress' going meeting, which ends on Friday. \"The odds for a larger policy support package will rise somewhat with a Trump victory,\" wrote Lynn Song, the chief economist for Greater China at ING bank, on Wednesday. China's top legislative body is considering a plan to raise $1.4 trillion in extra debt over the next few years to fund a part of an economic rescue package, Reuters reported last week, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter. Thursday's optimism in the Chinese markets contrasted with lackluster performance in Japan and South Korea, where the Nikkei 225 and the Kospi Index ended the day little changed. Analysts are also watching to see if Beijing will devalue the Chinese yuan now that Trump has won. \"Beijing might look to devalue the yuan as they did in 2018-2019 to counter tariff effects and boost export competitiveness,\" wrote Dilin Wu, a research strategist at brokerage Pepperstone, on Wednesday. However, this risks inflation and capital outflows in China, she added. The country is facing multiple economic challenges amid a real-estate crisis and high youth unemployment. On Thursday, China lowered its daily reference rate for the yuan to the lowest since late 2023. Despite the market optimism in China, analysts say Beijing could face a tough trade landscape. \"I think the challenge here is that China is still at a structural disadvantage in a trade war because they lack the symmetrical space,\" said Rick Waters, the managing director of Eurasia Group's China practice, at a press briefing on Thursday about the global implications of the US elections. \"They lack the ability to put tariffs on the US when the US does that to them,\" added Waters, who was the US State Department's top China policy official under the Biden administration.

But can the surge be sustained? Small-cap stocks tend to benefit from a growing economy and interest-rate cuts. The Federal Reserve pivoted to a regime of lower rates in September, with expectations the central bank will cut its short-term policy rate by another 25 basis points on Thursday. Jay Kaeppel, a senior research analyst at SentimentTrader, examined what history can tell us about what might happen next by looking at the historical performance of stocks in the six months after past presidential elections going back to 1944. While it’s tough to draw any conclusions regarding sector performance, Kaeppel noted that small caps were the leading factor nine times, including in the wake of each of the past three presidential elections. “For several years, large-cap and/or growth stocks have been the top-performing factors, hands down. Is that all going to change over the next six months?” Kaeppel wrote in a Wednesday client note. Of note, the sharp jump in long-term Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y since the Fed’s September rate cut has pushed up 30-year fixed rate mortgages and borrowing costs for the economy, which if sustained could risk triggering a recession and derail stocks. Kaeppel said the near-term question for traders will be whether it’s time to consider allocating away from large-cap and/or growth stocks and to move into small-caps and/or value equities. “History suggests such a move may be worthy of consideration,” he said, while warning there aren’t any guarantees for the 2024-25 postelection period.

The Fed recognized robust economic momentum, with the GDP rising by 2.8% in the second quarter, and resilient consumer confidence. Powell downplayed weak October employment data, noting that near-zero job growth was largely due to temporary factors like strikes and hurricanes rather than underlying economic weakness. Powell described the rate cut as part of a \"further recalibration\" of monetary policy, which he emphasized remains \"restrictive.\" He hinted at the possibility of more easing in the future but refrained from signaling a specific rate cut at the December meeting, stressing a data-dependent approach.

Following these allegations, Super Micro announced on Aug. 28 that it would delay filing its annual report to assess its internal controls over financial reporting. This delay further raised investor concerns about the company's financial transparency. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸 The stock took a steep dive. The combined impact of Hindenburg's report and Super Micro's delayed filing triggered a sharp sell-off, sending Super Micro shares plummeting by nearly 20% on Aug. 28. But it was not the end of the tumble. The stock fell another 33% on Oct. 30 after its auditor Ernst & Young resigned, saying that it was “unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management.” SMCI lost 12% and 10.5% on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, respectively. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang responded to the Hindenburg Research accusation by stating that the report contained \"false or inaccurate statements.\" Super Micro also said its board formed a special committee to investigate Ernst & Young's concerns.

Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow An increase in bond sales to prop up economic growth is expected, but the question is just how large the new stimulus will be. A surge in issuance may weigh on China’s debt market, and two trillion yuan ($280 billion) has become a key figure to watch. China’s central and local governments have sold an average of about 1.8 trillion yuan of notes per month from January to October, according to Bloomberg calculations. After accounting for 1.1 trillion yuan already in the pipeline for the rest of the year, the market is ready for about 2.5 trillion yuan of additional debt sales for November and December. Anything above that is likely to stir volatility. Optimism is growing that authorities may announce stronger stimulus measures after the meeting of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, the executive body of the nation’s top legislature, concludes on Friday. That would help cushion any blow from potential tariffs threatened by President-elect Donald Trump. Societe Generale SA is forecasting about two trillion yuan of new supply for the rest of 2024 and 2025. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. expects the same amount of additional bond sales for the next 12 months, while ANZ Bank expects lower additional net debt sales of about 1.5 trillion yuan for the remainder of 2024. “The market will need to see more than three trillion yuan to see a selloff,” said Kiyong Seong, lead Asia macro strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong. Given the uncertainty around US policy changes, he isn’t expecting the stimulus to be bumped up immediately. A surge in debt issuance may trigger volatility, as greater supply might shock the market. That’s especially the case after non-bank liquidity tightened when investors rushed into stocks during a surge in late September as the government announced some of its stimulus plans. China’s sovereign bonds have been trading in a tight range since late September, after retreating from the highest level in about two decades after the stimulus blitz unleashed in late September. The 10-year yield has hovered between 2.1% and 2.2% over the past month. New debt issuance may help lift long-term yields gradually, according to Frances Cheung, head of foreign-exchange and rates strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking. The country’s current monetary and fiscal policy supports a steepening bias in the government bond curve, she said.         ",

The S&P 500 finished 44 points, or 0.74% higher to close at a fresh all-time peak of 5,973.1 points, a move that extends the benchmark's 2024 gain to around 22%. More gains for megacap tech stocks, and a pullback in Treasury yields, helped the Nasdaq to a 285 point, or 151% gain, taking it to a new record high of 19,269.46 points. Bank stock declines, lead by a 4.3% slump for JPMorgan JPM, kept the Dow effectively unchanged on the day, with the last settlement indicating a modest 0.59 point decline. Stocks  got a late-session boost from a relatively uneventful Fed decision and press conference from Chairman Jerome Powell, which seemed more focused on the impact of former President Trump's economic plans, and the pair's ability to work together, than the central bank's assessment of growth and inflation. \"It’s no surprise that Chairman Powell did his best to deflect political-based questions and speculation, reaffirming that the Fed is apolitical — as it should be,\" said Brent Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst a eToro. \"Investors should remain confident with Powell remaining as Fed chairman, given the progress the committee has made on inflation without sacrificing the US economy.\" \"Powell would not tip his hand on whether the Fed would likely cut rates in December, which shouldn’t surprise investors,\" he added. \"However, the Fed appears more comfortable with the labor market and the current US economic backdrop than they did a few months ago.\" Updated at 3:23 PM EST Powell came out swinging when asked if he was concerned about being removed or demoted as Fed Chair under a new Trump administration, said such a move would be illegal. \"Not permitted under law,\" Powell responded tersely to a question from two reporters at his regular briefing. \"Not permitted under law.\" He had earlier said he would not leave his position if asked by the new President or any of his advisors. Updated at 2:44 PM EST Fed Chair Jerome Powell refused to be drawn into a discussion as to how, or when, policies from the new Trump administration would start to affect its interest rate decisions or growth and inflation forecasts.

Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The share of respondents who say they’d rent if they were going to move rose to a record 36% in a new survey by Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage finance giant. The figure has climbed 10 percentage points in the past three years. US renters took a big hit in the early pandemic years, with prices surging even as rock-bottom interest rates helped homeowners trim their mortgage bills and accumulate wealth. But the calculus has been shifting. Mortgage rates soared after the Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy, and after falling back a bit they’ve moved sharply higher again over the past 6 weeks. At around 7.25%, the cost of a 30-year mortgage — coupled with high home prices — is making many would-be buyers think twice. Meanwhile the worst of the rental spike appears over, with measures that look at newly-signed leases showing only a small annual rise. “One effect of the prolonged period of relatively high home prices of the past four years is that we are seeing a slowly growing preference to rent rather than buy on consumers’ next move,” said Mark Palim, Fannie Mae’s chief economist, in a post. “With rent growth expected to remain modest in 2025, more consumers may be seeking – and finding – attractive deals in the rental market.” The Fannie Mae October survey found that only one in five respondents said it was a good time to buy a home, down from 60% four years earlier.

Recommended Reading Trump win is ‘setback’ for climate protection, but clean energy advocates say progress will continue Despite broader market gains, renewable energy companies saw their stock values plummet on Wednesday amid fears that a newly victorious Trump administration could enact policies that erode the competitiveness of renewable energy. Although most renewable energy companies should recover — potentially quickly — from Wednesday's slump, industry analysts said. Indeed, some stocks experienced gains on Thursday morning, with solar developer Sunnova Energy nearly 5% and First Solar up more than 2%. Analysts are split on whether the coming change of administration will trigger a rush to close renewable energy deals in the final months of the year, or produce market stagnation as investors adopt a wait-and-see approach. But they generally agreed that demand for renewable energy will continue to increase amid ongoing load growth within the U.S. Stock prices for renewable energy companies took massive hits Wednesday as traders awoke to the news that Republicans had seized the presidency, flipped the Senate and remained in the running for control of the House — with losses ranging from 5.25% at NextEra Energy, up to 51.56% at Sunnova Energy. “Markets always move in an over-reactionary way, and I do believe the reactions we are seeing are pretty immediate and pretty exaggerated,” said Kevin Kang, a senior associate at Enverus Intelligence Research, said. But there's also a potential that policy actions by the second Trump administration could cause renewable energy dealmaking to stagnate, company valuations to drop, and for renewable energy development costs to rise, industry analysts, including Kang, said. Initial reactions have been based primarily on statements made by president-elect Donald Trump on the campaign trail, according to Raj Prabhu, CEO and co-founder of the Mercom Capital Group. A possible repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act is chief among investors' current concerns but is also relatively unlikely, given that a total repeal would harm key demographics that supported Trump, Prabhu said. The potential imposition of additional tariffs on imported solar panels or steel is another headlining concern, and may be more likely to come to fruition given Trump's history and what appears to be growing bipartisan support for curtailing foreign imports, analysts said.

The stock staged a breakaway gap Thursday on the highest trading volume since August, signaling strong buying conviction from larger market participants. Bars Pattern analysis indicates that AppLovin shares may trend higher to around $360 in a move that may play out until late March next year. Investors should watch key support levels on the stock's chart around $228 and $172.  AppLovin (APP) shares are in the spotlight after soaring Thursday following the release of better-than-expected results and a rosy outlook from the company, which benefitted from higher digital advertising spending on its artificial intelligence-powered advertising platform. The company, which offers software products to assist app developers market, monetize and analyze their apps, reported a 66% increase in its software revenue in the quarter, driven by AI enhancements to its AXON platform that enabled advertising partners to spend at a greater scale. AppLovin shares rose 46% to $246.53 on Thursday. The stock has surged more than six-fold since the start of the year through Thursday's close, making it 2024’s best performing technology stock that has a market capitalization of $5 billion or more. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on AppLovin’s chart and identify important price levels to watch out for. Since retracing to the closely watched 200-day moving average in early August, AppLovin shares have trended sharply higher, with the price staging a breakaway gap after the company’s better-than-expected quarterly report. Importantly, Thursday’s earnings-fueled rally occurred on the highest trading volume since August last year, signaling strong buying conviction from larger market participants, such as asset managers and hedge funds. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum with a reading just below 90, but also flashes heavily overbought conditions in the stock that could lead to short-term profit-taking. Let’s use technical analysis to predict how the stock’s current uptrend may play out and also identify key support levels to watch during declines. To project a potential upside target, we can use a bars pattern, a technique that uses historical price trends on the chart to predict future moves. In this case, we take the stock’s trend higher from February to July, which also followed a breakaway earnings gap, and reposition it from today’s low. This predicts a potential move to around $360, about 45% above Thursday’s closing price.      ",

        "body": "By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday, after the Federal Reserve announced a cut of 25 basis points (bps) in interest rates, extending a sharp rally sparked by Donald Trump's return as U.S. president. The Fed cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point as policymakers took note of a job market that has \"generally eased\" while inflation continues to move toward the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Markets had almost fully priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut for the November meeting and will now eye upcoming commentary from the central bank for guidance about the path of monetary policy. Investor expectations that Trump would lower corporate taxes and loosen regulations sparked a surge in each of the three major indexes in the prior session, with both the Dow Industrials and S&P 500 recording their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years. \"In an action-packed week, the Fed didn’t add any drama. Cutting by 25 basis points still keeps the federal funds rate restrictive, but not as restrictive as it was,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. \"Elections have consequences and we could see a marginal improvement in growth relative to their forecasts, but also a marginal increase in inflation relative to their forecasts. That would call for a more gradual pace of rate reductions.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.59 point, or flat, to 43,729.34, the S&P 500 gained 44.06 points, or 0.74%, to 5,973.10 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 285.99 points, or 1.51%, to 19,269.46. Communications services, up 1.92%, led S&P sector gains, buoyed by a jump of 11.81% in Warner Bros Discovery after a surprise third-quarter profit. Financials were the weakest of the 11 major S&P sectors, down 1.62% to give back some of the outsized gains in the prior session, as banks declined 3.09% after a surge of nearly 11% on Wednesday. JP Morgan lost 4.32% and Goldman Sachs shares shed 2.32% to weigh on the Dow. Expectations for continued rate cuts have been dialed back recently, however, as economic data continues to point to a resilient economy and the potential for higher inflation as a result of likely tariffs and increased government spending under Trump's administration. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said no decision has been made on what sort of policy action the central bank will take in December but the central bank is \"prepared to adjust our assessment of the appropriate pace and destination” for monetary policy amid uncertainty.

Tariffs are unlikely to be imposed at those levels, but were Trump to follow though, the universal 10% tariff could add as much as 1.8 percentage points to U.S. inflation, the report said. It added that this would trigger a resurgence in inflation in the first year rather than having an ongoing inflationary effect, and hit output by as much as 1 percentage point. The increase in tariffs to 60% on China could add as much as 1.2 percentage points to inflation and the hit to output could be around 0.5 percentage points, S&P said. S&P said it could lower its rating on the U.S., currently at AA+, in the next two-three years if political developments weigh on the strength of American institutions, jeapordize the dollar as the world's leading reserve currency, or if the already-high U.S. deficit rises further. S&P's current fiscal projections assume the government deficit will remain around current levels, it added. (Reporting by Yoruk Bahceli; editing by Dhara Ranasinghe) ",

Discovery (WBD) stock rose nearly 12% on Thursday after the company reported strong streaming results in the third quarter, including its largest-ever quarterly subscriber growth since the launch of Max. But revenue missed expectations as the media giant struggled with a drop in its studios segment and continued declines from its linear TV business. Shares pared gains by mid-afternoon, with the stock up a more modest 10% at the market close. Revenue came in at $9.62 billion, missing Bloomberg consensus expectations of $9.81 billion and a 3% drop compared to the $9.98 billion seen in Q3 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 versus a loss of $0.17 in the year-earlier period. Consensus expectations had anticipated a loss closer to $0.09 a share. In the second quarter, WBD took a massive $9.1 billion impairment charge related to its TV networks unit following the loss of its key NBA media rights. The company is currently tied up in litigation after suing the NBA in July, citing the \"unjustified rejection\" of its matching rights proposal. Streaming was the bright spot in the quarter, with 7.2 million subscribers added, a beat compared to estimates of a 6.1 million net increase and the company's largest quarterly subscriber growth yet. The additions were also ahead of the 700,000 subscriber loss the company reported in the year-earlier period. The subscriber strength comes amid the recent launch of Max in markets outside of the US, including Latin America and Europe, along with increased bundling with competitors. Key programming, like the second season of \"House of the Dragon,\" along with the Olympics, also helped boost the metric. Outside of strong subscribers, the company saw a 49% year-over-year jump in streaming advertising revenue. Separately, the division posted profits of $289 million in the quarter compared to the $111 million it reported in Q3 2023. Recent price hikes have helped aid profits. The company boosted the price of its ad-free plans on Max in June. On the earnings call, WBD management said revenue growth, profit growth, and subscriber growth are expected to continue in the current quarter with Q3 serving as a \"material inflection point.\" The company also has its upcoming sports streaming partnership with Disney (DIS) and Fox (FOXA), although a judge temporarily blocked the launch, citing antitrust concerns. Amid streaming's success, other pockets of the business remained under pressure. Advertising revenue for its networks unit plummeted 13% year over year after it dropped 10% in the second quarter and 11% in Q1.

A \"public reengaged in speculation,\" as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel. Market tops are often hallmarked by \"exuberance,\" Emanuel wrote. But with subdued activity in the IPO market and a lack of meme-like action in stocks where equities are surging without the fundamentals to back them, the true signs of an overstretched market rally aren't flashing red. Emanuel admits when considering the S&P 500 is selling at more than 24 times the past 12 months' earnings, stocks look expensive from a valuation perspective. But as strategists often point out, high valuations aren't typically a great market-timing tool. \"Expensive has a history of getting more expensive and lasting longer with greater gains,\" Emanuel wrote. \"This market will be driven higher by the policy prospect of deregulation in DC driving a capital market cycle largely absent since the [October 2022] trough.\" Additionally, Emanuel cites the history of a bull markets. The current bull market is 25 months old and boasts a return of 65%. This is well short of the average 50-month-long bull market that returns 152%. The case for stocks to run higher is also supported by the Fed's cutting cycle, Emanuel argues. Since the Fed cut rates by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, the 10-year Treasury yield has soared about 80 basis points to about 4.42%. Typically, this would be considered a headwind for stocks. Instead, the S&P 500 has risen more than 5%. Emanuel points out the only other time this happened during a Fed rate-cutting cycle was the 1995 \"soft landing,\" where the economy remained on solid footing and \"the start of a glorious stock market epoch\" began, per Emanuel. In a client note on Tuesday night, Stifel chief equity strategist Barry Bannister offered similar sentiment to Emanuel, writing that the\" S&P 500 has entered a mania.\" Bannister, who's been bearish on stocks amid the rally, admits the index could keep pushing higher to the low 6,000s in the coming months. This would come as the S&P 500 reaches an 80-year-high valuation, Bannister wrote. But he also still sees a downside scenario where the index falls from those levels to 5,250 a year later.      ",

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) — Most U.S. stocks rose Thursday, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again to make things easier for the economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7% to add to its surge from the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged and edged down by less than a point, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. The Fed’s announcement that it was easing its main interest rate caused few ripples in the market because even the precise size of it was so well anticipated by investors. The central bank began easing rates in September and indicated more cuts were likely to come, as it focuses more on keeping the job market humming after helping get inflation nearly down to its 2% target. What’s less certain in the minds of investors now is how much Trump’s victory may upset the Fed’s plans. Trump is pushing for tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation higher, along with the economy’s growth. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. For now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, nothing is changing. “In the near term, the election will have no effects” on interest-rate policy, he said. With any president, Powell said the Fed looks at possible policy changes and simulates how they could affect the economy. Only after looking at the overall effect of all the policies do Fed officials decide how that should shape where interest rates go. And at this point, Powell said it’s still not clear what the policies will be after Trump returns to the White House. “We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,” he said. On Wall Street, healthcare services company McKesson helped drive the market by jumping 10.6% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Lyft revved up by 22.8% after the ride-hailing app breezed past Wall Street’s sales and profit expectations, and Ralph Lauren rose 6.6% after customers in Asia and Europe helped it deliver a bigger profit than expected. They helped make up for bank stocks, which gave back some of their stellar gains from the day before. Other “Trump trades” that had rocketed higher after the election also lost some of their juice. JPMorgan Chase fell 4.3%, a day after banks decisively led the market on expectations that a stronger economy and lighter regulation would mean fatter profits. It and Goldman Sachs were the biggest reasons for the Dow Jones Industrial Average's slight loss.               ",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market assets shook off a post-election selloff, following the broader market higher on Thursday as the Federal Reserve stuck to a widely expected quarter percentage point interest rate cut. Most Read from Bloomberg Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow MSCI’s index for emerging currencies rose 0.2%, lifted by big gains from the Colombian peso and the Hungarian forint. A gauge tracking developing world stocks rallied further after the rate decision and closed 0.8% higher. The moves were part of a wider rally across assets a day after Donald Trump’s election victory, with US stocks, bonds and commodities climbing. The US central bank lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The adjustment follows a half-point cut in September. Policymakers removed a line about having “greater confidence” that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%, though they noted inflation has “made progress” toward the central bank’s goal. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the decision that the US economy remains strong. “Powell expressed a lot of confidence in the economy and in current monetary policy,” said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies LLC. “He indicated that it is far too early to input any new policies from the new administration into their forecast models, so no read through from the election. A very middle of the road rate decision that is unlikely to have any major impact on markets near term.” Mexico’s currency, which is sensitive to US economic and political risks given the country’s close trade links, also held onto gains, rising 1.4% against the dollar. Latin American currencies were among the biggest gainers given their carry-trade appeal, while also getting a boost from rising commodity prices. The Colombian peso rose as much as 2.3%. The Brazilian real gained briefly before falling 0.2% against the greenback. “Latam is still associated with the strongest carry appeal,” said Brendan McKenna, a strategist at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. “These currencies have been beaten up a little bit recently, so entry points and a combination for carry makes them a bit more attractive.” Equities across emerging markets rallied, ending the day 0.8% higher. The index is boosted by gains in Asian stocks like Meituan, Tencent Holdings and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Optimism that China could deploy a larger fiscal stimulus in light of a new Trump administration is also boosting emerging-market assets.            ",

        "body": "A tech-led rally brought new record highs for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) Thursday as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory. In a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The S&P 500 rose roughly 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite moved nearly 1.5% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 8 basis points to 4.34%. Spirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. Powell was asked multiple times on Thursday about how an incoming Trump administration could impact the Fed's path forward. \"In the near term, the election will have no effect on our policy decisions,\" Powell said. When questioned whether he'd step down as Fed chair if asked to do so by Trump, Powell simply said \"no.\" By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy During a roaring rally over the past two sessions, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. But some of the market's biggest movers this week have once again been from the market's largest stocks. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record high on Thursday. The index is up over 8% over the last five days, outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 4.69%. Powell had a simple but poignant response when asked if he'd resign if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to step down. \"No.\" All three of the major stock indexes were headed for record closes on Thursday as investors digested a subdued press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up more than 1.6% and shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.2% on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. Each average moved higher as Powell's presser ended. Powell dodged multiple political-focused questions during his press conference, which is unsurprising given that the election occurred less than 48 hours ago. It's also not a surprise considering his contentious relationship with President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, who frequently criticized Powell during his first term in office, had told Bloomberg in a July interview that he'd let the central bank leader serve out his term, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing,\" he said at the time. But Trump has frequently flip-flopped his stance on Powell. Just a few months prior to the aforementioned Bloomberg interview, Trump said he would not reappoint the Fed chair, accusing the central bank leader of manipulating rates to give Democrats an edge in the election. On Thursday, when asked if a sitting US president has the right to fire or demote a Fed chair or any of the Fed governors, Powell simply replied: \"It's not permitted under the law.\" The latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed year-over-year price increases didn't fall in September. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.7% in September, above Wall Street's expectations for 2.6% and in line with the 2.7% seen in August. But during Thursday's press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the Fed also looks at the three- and six-month annualized rates of Core PCE to identify trends. Our chart below shows the three- and six-month annualized rates are at 2.3%. Broadly, Powell said the data is showing \"that we really have made significant progress.\" Since the Fed began cutting interest rates, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose roughly 80 basis points to hit a recent high of about 4.47%. On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that move higher was likely not \"principally about higher inflation expectations.\" He reasoned the move higher was more likely driven by better-than-expected economic growth. Powell later added that for higher bond yields to impact Fed policy they would need to see \"material changes in financial conditions that \"last\" and \"are persistent.\" \"We don't know that about these what we've seen so far,\" Powell said. In a press conference that kicked off at 2:30 p.m. ET following the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the election results, noting the central bank will not make decisions based on expected policy changes from a new administration. \"In the near term, the election will have no effect on our policy decisions,\" he said. \"We don't know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be. We, therefore, don't know what the effects on the economy would be. Specifically, whether and to what extent those policies would matter for the achievement of our goal variables: maximum employment and price stability.\" Compared to the current Biden administration, Trump and his proposed policies have been viewed as more inflationary given his campaign promises of high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts, and curbs on immigration. \"We don't guess. We don't speculate, and we don't assume,\" Powell continued, adding that it's possible any administration's policies or policies put in place by Congress could generate economic effects that the Fed would address at that time if deemed appropriate. In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday. After a half a percentage point cut in September, Thursday's unanimous decision move brings the central bank's benchmark rate down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: This new cut was justified, according to the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee, in support of its goals to maintain stable prices and full employment. However, the central bank removed language from its policy statement that the \"committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%,\" raising questions about the pace and number of future rate cuts. Instead the policy statement read: “the Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance.” Read more here. The Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Broadly, Big Tech led the market action, with all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META). In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%. Below is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president. \"They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new,\" said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one. Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes. And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions.

The stock market's feverish rally following Donald Trump's presidential election victory may have just been an early appetizer for a strong few months of gains. \"Exuberance lies ahead,\" Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. \"President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response.\" Emanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A \"public reengaged in speculation,\" as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel.

The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.79% through Wednesday, up from 6.72% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%. Mortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs. Read more here. About 24 hours after Donald Trump won the presidential election, American CEOs are already weighing on how the president-elect's policies could impact their business. For one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.” “Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said. Trump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry. \"We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different,\" Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results. Raymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability. The investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. \"Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. \"Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,\" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the \"Trump Trade\" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session.

Investors have driven exposure to the US equities benchmark to the highest in three years since Trump’s win, suggesting the rally could run out of steam, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts. The new administration will reportedly feature prominent China hawks and strategists are pondering the potential for Trump’s economic policies to spur inflation and affect the path for Federal Reserve interest rates. “There are question marks around another round of Trump tariffs, the deficit and upward pressure on the dollar, forcing the Fed to slow the pace of easing,” said Phillip Wool, head of portfolio management at Rayliant Global Advisors. “All of those anxieties seem to be registering more significantly with investors today.” Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped as much as 3.3%. Senator Marco Rubio — who has taken an aggressive stance on China’s emergence as an economic power — is expected to be named secretary of state, Bloomberg reported. Representative Mike Waltz, who views China as a “greater threat” to the US than any other nation, is in line to be national security advisor. “Trump’s reported appointments of well-known China hawks such as Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz are indeed weighing on the Hong Kong market’s sentiment,” said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier. “This underscores the high likelihood of Trump following through on his campaign pledge to implement punitive tariffs on China’s exports to the US.” US inflation data due Wednesday is the next major item on the agenda this week for investors.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration “I expect 2024 returns to be larger than 2016,” Andrew Tyler, the bank’s head of US market intelligence, wrote in a note to clients Monday. A big advantage for the S&P 500 Index is weakness outside the US, with China, the UK, EU, Canada and Mexico all experiencing softer growth than they did back then. Strength in the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks will continue to propel equity markets, while financials will be the best performing S&P 500 sector through the end of the year. The call comes after the broad equities benchmark posted its best week in the last 12 months, driven by investors’ belief that a Trump presidency will be good for Corporate America. Tyler reiterated his tactically bullish view and recommends a barbell approach to play the rally through the end of 2024. He’s cautious on energy due to a disappointing earnings season for the segment. The note didn’t speculate on what will happen in 2025, however, where bigger risks lie ahead. The Federal Reserve is moving cautiously on interest rate cuts, in part because many of Trump’s policies, from deporting undocumented workers to stymieing trade through protectionist tariffs, are considered inflationary. With Treasury yields back on the rise, they could put a lid on future equity gains, as the S&P 500 is up 50% in the past two years, trading above 6,000 for the first time ever, and valued at 23 times projected earnings, about 40% more than its average since 2000. JPMorgan’s trading desk isn’t alone. Many Wall Street pros are bullish about the stock market heading into the end of the year. Part of the reason is simply that the US election removed a hurdle of uncertainty and now equities are entering a seasonally positive period. On Monday, Morgan Stanley strategists led by Mike Wilson said the post-election stock rally that kicked off last week is on track to continue, particularly in shares of financials, industrials, and commodity cyclicals. At Oppenheimer Asset Management, chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus lifted his year-end S&P 500 target to a Street high of 6,200. And Evercore ISI’s Julian Emanuel said last week that the bull market in stocks was just getting started.         ",

AbbVie shares plunged after the pharma company's schizophrenia treatment came up short in a clinical trial, helping boost competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb. Shares of integrated circuit maker Monolithic Power Systems tumbled after researchers said Nvidia may limit the use of a Monolithic component in its latest AI chips.  Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher to start the new trading week as markets further digested the results of last week's election and the latest interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 added 0.1% on Monday. The Nasdaq wavered for most of the day but closed with a gain of a bit less than 0.1%, with surging cryptocurrency prices buoying shares of tech firms with ties to crypto. The Dow built on its post-election rally, jumping 0.7% to notch its first-ever close above 44,000. Bond markets were closed in observance of Veterans Day. Shares of pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) popped 10.5% higher, logging the top daily performance in the S&P 500, after competitor AbbVie (ABBV) reported that its experimental schizophrenic treatment failed to reach the desired goals in a Phase 2 trial. Bristol-Myers Squibb entered the schizophrenia treatment market through last year's acquisition of biopharma firm Karuna Therapeutics, whose drug KarXT received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in September. AbbVie shares plunged 12.6% on Monday. Albemarle (ALB) shares jumped 9.6%, continuing their march higher since the world's largest lithium miner released third-quarter results last week. Although Albemarle reported a net loss of $1.1 billion, the company announced a 50% reduction in capital expenditures in 2025, as well as other cost-cutting measures that include laying off around 6% of its global workforce. Analysts suggested these moves could help Albemarle navigate low lithium prices, which the company expects to persist for some time. Tesla (TSLA) shares surged 9%, extending a string of gains posted in the wake of last week's election. There are expectations that Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and vocal supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, will play an advisory role in the next administration, where he could advocate on issues like tariffs and tax credits. Analysts at Wedbush lifted their price target on Tesla shares by $100, saying Trump's election could be transformative for the company's automation and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions.   ",

        "body": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole. It's been a muted session in Asia with investors still nursing a grudge over China's latest policy package, which was heavy on debt swapping but again light on direct stimulus. Analysts assume Beijing wants to keep its powder dry should President-elect Trump really go ahead with his proposed 60% tariffs, but that just extends the wait for a few weeks or months. The need for action was underlined by inflation data on the weekend that showed Chinese consumer prices grew just 0.3% in the year to October, while producer prices dropped 2.9% y/y as China continued to export deflation. Eyes are now on retail sales and industrial output this Friday for any hint that Beijing's policies are gaining traction. A 1.3% fall in Chinese blue chips suggested hopes were not particularly high. Over in Japan, investors are waiting to see if Prime Minister Ishiba will still be in power after a parliamentary vote today. The general assumption is that he will survive, though that leaves him with the tricky task of running a minority government. An added twist came when Yuichiro Tamaki, the head of a Japanese opposition party that has emerged as a potential king maker in parliament, said a tabloid report about his extra-marital affair with a model was \"basically true\". Such political uncertainty complicates life for the Bank of Japan as it ponders whether to hike rates next month. Opinions from its last meeting showed some members were already wary of market volatility, and that was before Trump's win. At the same time, markets see less scope for further aggressive easing by the Federal Reserve given that Trump's stated policies, if followed in full, would likely put upward pressure on inflation and bond yields. The implied chance of a December rate cut has come back to 66%, from atop 80% before the election, and a move in January is now seen as an outside bet. JPMorgan, for one, sees the Fed easing cycle terminating at 3.5%, rather than 3.0%. U.S. consumer prices are due Wednesday and a core reading above the 0.3% forecast would be a further blow to hopes for a December easing. All of which helped to nudge the dollar up 0.5% on the yen to 153.40, while the euro stayed stuck at $1.0725. The political outlook was no clearer in Europe as German Chancellor Scholz said he would be willing to bring forward a vote of confidence in parliament to before Christmas, which would pave the way for snap elections.

In year-on-year (YoY) terms, sales volumes were slightly down (-1.2%). Germany and Spain saw positive results, while France, the UK, and Italy reported weaker YoY results. Year-to-date (YTD) sales remain broadly flat (+0.1%) in comparison to the previous year. Ongoing economic and political challenges in the region are hindering consumer confidence, and new vehicle sales continue to struggle. While monetary policy easing and new model activity are expected to provide some relief in the market in 2025, the prevailing headwinds are likely to continue to act as a drag on vehicle sales. The PV selling rate for Western Europe improved to 11.6 million units/year in October though the evolution of YoY results over H2 has generally been unfavourable and we expect the 2024 market will fall short of 2023. We do anticipate a pick-up in market activity in 2025, supported by monetary easing measures that should boost the economy. Meanwhile, vehicle pricing should ease a little, helped by new models cranking up competition. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions, along with political and economic uncertainties, are expected to weigh on sales. The German PV market registered 232k units in October, a 6% increase YoY. Furthermore, the selling rate improved MoM by 10%. YTD sales are now 2.35 millon units, down slightly by 0.4% YoY, though this is far from a strong base for comparison. Business registrations were the main driver of the positive result, up 10.8% YoY, whereas private new registrations recorded a decrease of 2.5% YoY. Italy’s PV market fell for a third consecutive month in October as new car registrations contracted 9% YoY to 127k units. The selling rate remained broadly flat at 1.54 million units. Higher energy costs have caused significant increases in the cost of production which has posed serious challenges to Italy’s supply chain. Furthermore, the broader economic challenges the country is facing such as high interest rates and broadly flat levels of private consumption have further contributed to the downturn in car sales. The French PV market declined by 11.1% YoY to 135.5k units in October. The selling rate fell 9.3% MoM to 1.57 million units/year. This is now the sixth consecutive month that PV sales have fallen YoY. The absence of subsidies and ongoing political uncertainty, particularly concerning the fiscal deficit, continue to undermine consumer confidence. The UK PV market registered 144k units in October, a 6% decline YoY. The selling rate increased by 29% MoM to 2.1 millon units. YTD sales now stand at 1.66 million units, up 3.3% YoY. The Spanish PV market registered 83.5k units in October, a 7.2% increase YoY and a continuation of the trend of growth seen in September. YTD sales now stand at 828k units, a 4.9% increase compared to the same period last year. Purchases by individuals accounted for almost half of the sales volumes.      ",

Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The asset-management company — which helped hasten the widespread adoption of ETFs — is seeking regulatory approval for two new funds, the iShares Government Money Market ETF and the iShares Prime Money Market ETF, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. BlackRock’s rollout would significantly expand an experiment that started in September, when the Texas Capital Government Money Market ETF became the first to target traditional funds, which have seen their assets swell to a record $6.6 trillion. That fund, which is still the only one of its kind, has about $43 million in assets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ETFs have steadily taken over vast parts of the securities business in part because they’re easier to shift in and out of rapidly, making them a draw to individual investors. In the case of the money-market funds, however, that liquidity comes at the expense of a protection provided by traditional funds: Unlike those, the ETFs aren’t required to maintain a stable net-asset value of $1, meaning investors can be exposed to some downside risk. “To anybody looking for a money-market to have a stable NAV, these won’t do it,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Is a fixed NAV overrated? I think so,” he said. “That’s the case these funds will make.” It still remains to be seen whether the potential appeal of ETFs will carry over to money-market investors, who are primarily looking for a safe way to earn a higher return than traditional savings accounts. When launching its fund, Texas Capital said that the increased liquidity of an ETF would appeal to institutional investors by allowing them to buy and sell the shares throughout the day. BlackRock declined to comment on the filings, citing regulatory guidelines. Investors have piled into money-market funds over the past several years, thanks in a large part to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking cycle that sent short-term rates above 5%. While the central bank has begun to ease policy, short term rates are still high enough to keep pulling cash toward money-market funds, which saw their assets rise to an all-time high last week.

        "body": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are piling into bullish options bets on Tesla shares, with the stock hitting its highest level in more than two years on bets that CEO Elon Musk’s close ties to President-elect Donald Trump may benefit the electric car maker. Tesla’s shares were up about 8% to $346.12 on Monday and have rallied more than 35% since the Nov. 5 election. They now stand at their highest level since April 2022. Tesla's contracts were the most heavily traded options on individual stocks on Monday, with some 2.5 million contracts changing hands by noon - more than twice the usual pace, according to Trade Alert. \"It's euphoric,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \"Tesla is by far the most active option at our shop.” He noted a heavy concentration of call contracts at the $400 level, some 13% above the stock’s current price. Trade Alert data showed much of the trading concentrated in near-term contracts, with options expiring by Friday making up about 56% of the total trading volume. Musk has supported Trump for months and contributed at least $119 million to a pro-Trump spending group, federal records show. The billionaire’s business ventures, which in addition to Tesla EVs range from SpaceX rockets to Neuralink brain chips, depend heavily on regulation, subsidies and policy, and analysts said they could benefit from a friendly administration. On Monday, Wedbush Securities raised its target price on Tesla shares to $400 from $300, saying they see the Trump White House win as a \"gamechanger for the autonomous and AI (artificial intelligence) story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years.\" Tesla options struck at $350 and $400, and set to expire by Friday, were the two most actively traded contracts with combined volume of about 180,000 contracts. The bullish options action was also likely helping to push the stock higher, as options dealers who sold upside contracts react to the soaring stock by buying more of the shares to cover their own risk. \"If enough people speculate on certain strikes, the stock can have a tendency to move toward those strikes,\" Sosnick said. The big jump in the stock price and massive options interest also means Tesla call options are growing pricey and could draw sellers, said Brent Kochuba, founder of financial insights company SpotGamma. Should the stock fail to keep up with its recent moves, it might lead to a drop in the price of those calls, he said. \"That can pressure the stock down,\" Kochuba said.

Everything from bitcoin to Tesla to the US dollar rallied Monday morning. The world's largest cryptocurrency hit an all-time high above $82,000 as investors continued to celebrate Trump's win, which the market expects to be a positive catalyst for crypto. Tesla stock rose over 8% to about $348.50. The stock reclaimed a $1 trillion market cap at the end of last week for the first time since April 2022.

Investors' top concern this week is inflation data, with consumer price index data for the month of October set to be released Wednesday morning. Economists expect a 2.5% year-over-year jump in CPI, compared to a rise of 2.4% in the prior month. Investors will get more inflation data on Thursday when the producer price index is released.

The Trade Desk’s Q3 revenues totaled $628 million, up 27% from the same period last year, per a company announcement. For the first nine months of the year, the company’s consolidated revenues totaled more than $1.7 billion, also 27% higher than the same period last year.  The strong Q3 earnings mark the 11th straight quarter that The Trade Desk has posted a greater than 20% revenue gain. Customer retention for the quarter remained high at greater than 95%. In a call with analysts, CEO and co-founder Jeff Green pointed to several “tailwinds” that promise continued strength for the company, including growth in the connected television (CTV) sector, robust interest in new identity solutions and new opportunities for using artificial intelligence (AI). The Trade Desk’s earnings reflect some of the ways that digital marketing is evolving, as the company is gaining share in a developing media ecosystem, with gains in connected TV (CTV) and retail media. It is also implementing more AI-based strategies and preparing for whatever the future may hold for Google amid its legal troubles. In a call with analysts, Green pointed to several “tailwinds” that are working in the company’s favor. First among them was the CTV sector. Already accounting for more than 40% of the company’s business, CTV remained the fastest-growing channel in the third quarter and showed no signs of slowing down. He added that the company has signed more multi-year joint business plans with agencies and brands. These partnerships have led to wider adoption of new identity and authentication tools, such as Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), EUID, OpenPath and OpenPass, which were developed as Google had planned to deprecate cookies. While Google’s plan has since been abandoned, marketers continue to look for alternative IDs that can address needs around privacy and multichannel marketing. In Trade Desk’s third quarter alone, Spotify plotted new integrations of OpenPath and UID2, Roku adopted UID2 and U.K. company Motorsport Network adopted EUID for its 130 media properties. Another tailwind Green mentioned was The Trade Desk’s AI strategy. He noted that the company is continuing to hone its AI offering, Kokai, and is looking across its suite of products in search of opportunities for advancement via AI. Green also noted that while Google’s antitrust trial and future remain up in the air, the mere fact that the company is under scrutiny could present more opportunities for The Trade Desk.  “Whatever the outcome of the trial, I do believe that Google will become more cautious, if not less involved, in the part of their business where they compete with us,” Green said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average scored its 43rd record of the year, closing above 44,000 for the first time ever. The S&P 500 closed above 6,000 also for the first time in its 51st record close of the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched a 32nd record close. Within the S&P consumer discretionary, financials and industrials paced the gains, while real estate, healthcare and tech saw fractional losses. Trump, who won the popular and electoral vote, ran on pro-business, less regulation, smaller government and lower taxes, among other initiatives. He has started to assemble his team as of Monday evening. Former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin has been picked to join President-elect Donald Trump’s administration as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator. Tom Homan is his new border czar, and NY Rep. Elise Stefanik was appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Read On The Fox Business App National Debt Tracker: Foxbusiness.com Investor Cathie Wood, of Ark Invest, said Trump’s incoming administration may have more economic benefits than Ronald Reagan did after he cut taxes and whittled down the deficit in the 80s. \"Deregulation (defanging the SEC, FTC, and others), government spending cuts (making room for the private sector), tax cuts, and a focus on technologically enabled innovation are likely to turbocharge the US economy more powerfully than during the Reagan Revolution.\" she explained in a video message posted on X. Tesla, run by close Trump advisor Elon Musk, rose another 9%, with its market cap crossing $1 trillion. \"We are raising our price target on Tesla to $400 from $300 as we believe the Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to clients. The company’s market cap could hit $2 trillion over the next 12 to 18 months, he added. Tesla Headed For $2 Trillion Valuation The company’s AI and autonomous opportunity is \"worth $1 trillion alone for Tesla, and we fully expect under a Trump White House these key initiatives will now get fast-tracked as the federal regulatory spiderweb that Musk & Co. have encountered over the past few years around FSD [fully self-driving]/autonomous clears significantly under a new Trump era\" he noted. Trump’s win also propelled bitcoin to new records. The largest cryptocurrency by market value topped $88,000 late Monday, a new, inflation-adjusted all-time high, as investors embrace what is expected to be his pro-crypto policies.      ",

        "body": "By Zaheer Kachwala (Reuters) -Tesla shares extended last week's sharp rally with a jump of over 8% on Monday, fueled by bets of the automaker benefiting from CEO Elon Musk's close ties with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. At $348.30, Tesla is expected to add nearly $87 billion to its value if gains hold. The stock has jumped nearly 28% since Trump's election victory was declared on Wednesday, surpassing $1 trillion in market value for the first time in two years. Tesla's year-to-date gains were just over 1% before Trump secured his second term at the White House. Musk has been supporting Trump for months in the hopes that his close ties to the now President-elect would position his companies to benefit under the new administration, analysts have said. The billionaire contributed at least $119 million to a pro-Trump spending group, federal records show. \"As an 'efficiency Czar', Musk is likely to see this as an opportunity to sweep away red tape and streamline regulation\", potentially helping his companies that are \"at the forefront of technological innovation\", said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. From Tesla's electric vehicles to SpaceX rockets and Neuralink brain chips, Musk's business ventures depend heavily on government regulation, subsidies or policy. Tesla's self-driving technology has been under scrutiny from safety regulators as Musk attempts to shift the company's focus towards autonomous driving and robotaxis. In September, Trump said he would establish a government efficiency commission headed by Musk to cut federal spending. Musk's potential influence in the government could be significant for his other ventures, such as the Starlink broadband system, owing to his role as a major contractor with the U.S. Department of Defense. Streeter said claims of \"preferential treatment\" have the potential to end up in court, but given the litigation route is long and difficult, Musk's businesses have plenty of time to benefit. Trump has also vowed to pare back certain EV incentives of the Biden administration, but startups are likely to take a bigger hit than Tesla because of the automaker's heft in the market, analysts have said.

High homeownership costs, rising mortgage rates and other economic burdens create steep hurdles for Millennials and Gen Z who increasingly find themselves on the sidelines of homeownership. Don't Miss: ‘Beating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.38% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100 Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. The latest annual report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) revealed that the average age rose from 49 to 56 since July 2023, marking a historic high compared to the low-to-mid 40s seen in the early 2010s. The situation is not easy for first-time buyers, who face a median age of 38, up from 35 and a market share dropping from 32% to 24% – the lowest rate since NAR began tracking these statistics in 1981. The drop reflects a market becoming less accessible as home prices and mortgage rates continue to rise. In October 2023, mortgage rates reached 8%, a massive leap from record lows during the pandemic, pushing monthly payments sharply upward.

One of the biggest obstacles is saving for a down payment. According to NAR, the median U.S. home price is now $435,000, up 39% since 2020. For an 18.6% down payment, the median amount buyers put down, young buyers need roughly $78,300. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, that's nearly equivalent to the annual U.S. median household income of $80,610.

The U.S. holiday was originally called Armistice Day, because it commemorated the date and time — Nov. 11, 1918, at 11 a.m. — of the signing of the cease-fire that ended World War I. In 1919, on the first anniversary of the armistice, President Woodrow Wilson said the day “will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country’s service.” According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, it was to be “a day observed with parades and public meetings and a brief suspension of business beginning at 11 a.m.” How Trump will transform banking regulation — even with Powell at the Fed My grandmother gave her neighbor $6,000 to buy a car. There was no car. How can I protect her from further exploitation? S&P 500 eclipses 6,000 and Dow surpasses 44,000. Here’s why stocks could keep climbing. Small-cap stocks are smoking the S&P 500. Bond yields may hold the key. Our son lived in our basement ‘finding himself.’ We give him an allowance — and now he lives off gig work in a studio with his girlfriend. What can we do? Veterans Day is now a federal holiday that honors all military veterans. It is also a day marked by many closures. Here are details about what to expect on Veterans Day. The two major stock markets — the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq — will be open, but bond markets are closed. For several years, NYSE did close on Veterans Day, but that changed in 1954, when it opted instead to stay open but observe a two-minute shutdown. Now, the two-minute observation occurs before the market opening, so there’s no interruption to the trading day. As for the bond markets, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the trade group that represents the bond community, said it issues closing recommendations based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s holiday calendar — and that calendar indeed includes Veterans Day. The U.S. Postal Service will not deliver mail on Veterans Day. UPS UPS and FedEx FDX will offer many of their regular services, but customers should expect some modifications. Most banks are closed. That includes branches of Bank of America BAC, Chase Bank JPM, Capital One COF, TD Bank TD and Wells Fargo WFC. Since Veterans Day is a federal holiday, all non-essential federal government offices are closed. It is also a state holiday in nearly every state, according to the Office Holidays website. Wisconsin is the one notable exception: It doesn’t designate Veterans Day as a state holiday, though there’s been efforts by local veterans and some legislators to change that.         ",

        "body": "President-elect Donald Trump drew more support from a broad range of voters in the 2024 election compared to 2020, and you can add Americans stuck in tough housing markets to the list. An NBC News analysis of housing and voting data show that the counties where it's most difficult to buy a home saw the biggest shifts toward Trump. Using its home buyer index to gauge ease or difficulty, the report showed that the top 10% of counties with the toughest markets experienced a median shift of 4.5 percentage points in the vote share toward Trump. The top 20% with the toughest housing markets saw a 4.2-point shift to the Republican side. That outpaced the nationwide median, which showed a 3.1-point tilt to Trump, according to NBC. Those differences likely proved decisive in key swing counties as many saw margins separating the parties that were just over 1 percentage point. The housing market could also help explain why Trump improved his performance in deep-blue states. In New Jersey, for example, Ocean County has the fourth hardest market, and Trump's share of the vote grew by 7.9 points. Union County is the eighth worst and saw a 14.5-point red shift, while Passaic County came in at 16th worst and surged toward Trump by 19.6 points. \"Housing prices are a big part of the inflation story, especially the most persistent and severe parts of the inflation story,\" Bernard Fraga, an Emory University professor specializing in voter turnout, told NBC. \"So you can’t separate out the price of housing from voters’ general concerns about the state of the economy.\" To be sure, Kamala Harris offered a housing plan that was praised by some experts as the most aggressive since the post-World War II boom. It included down payment assistance for first-time buyers and encouraged homebuilders to increase housing supply with tax breaks. Meanwhile, Trump told Bloomberg that he would lower housing costs by easing environmental and permitting rules. But he also has suggested at campaign events that he would limit low-income housing developments in suburbs. The Republican Party’s 2024 platform blamed high housing costs on illegal immigrants, and vowed to deport them, which some housing experts have said would reduce the availability of construction workers and add to costs. The platform also promised a mix of demand- and supply-side measures. Early in the 2024 election season, housing had emerged as a major issue. According to a Redfin-commissioned survey released in March, more than half of homeowners and renters said housing affordability was influencing their vote. And almost two-thirds of homeowners and renters said housing affordability made them feel negatively about the economy.     ",

In the wake of reports of antisemitic violence against Israeli football fans in Amsterdam last Thursday, Ackman said he planned to pull Pershing Square’s secondary listing from the Amsterdam Euronext exchange and transfer those shares to the London Stock Exchange. “Concentrating the listing on one exchange, the LSE, and leaving a jurisdiction that fails to protect its tourists and minority populations combine both good business and moral principles. We can also save money and improve liquidity for shareholders to boot,” Ackman posted on X. Ackman also said he would push for Universal Music Group, a company on whose board he sits, also to depart Euronext in favor of a U.S. listing. Ackman said UMG traded at a considerable discount on Euronext because its primary listing in Amsterdam prevented it from being added to the S&P 500 and other popular indices. “Pershing Square has a contractual right to cause UMG to be listed in the US. We will exercise this right and achieve a US listing for UMG no later than some time next year,” he said. Reports emerged last week that Israelis were targeted in a series of antisemitic attacks in Amerstdam after local football club Ajax’s Europa League fixture with Maccabi Tel Aviv on Thursday. Amsterdam’s mayor Femke Halsema described how Israeli fans were targeted in a series of “hit and run” attacks on Thursday night by \"gangs of guys on scooters.\" Police officials said visiting fans were pelted with fireworks, and five people were taken to hospital with injuries. Another 30 were reported to have suffered minor injuries. “I am deeply ashamed of the behavior that unfolded,” Halsema told reporters. “On Telegram groups, people talked of going to hunt down Jews. It’s so terrible I can’t find the words for it.” Some 62 arrests were initially made in the build-up to the fixture, however, officials said this didn’t relate to the reported “hit and run” incidents in the wake of the match. \"In several places in the city, supporters were attacked, abused, and pelted with fireworks,\" said city officials. The attacks received condemnation from leaders across the globe, including U.S. president Joe Biden. \"The anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam are despicable and echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted,\" Biden wrote on X.

At least some of the rally can be explained by the removal of election uncertainty. At the same time, the strength of the market response has arguably been at odds with what many economists consider the prospect of worse economic policies under President-elect Trump. Maybe it’s traders and investors betting that policies bad for the market won’t actually be implemented. After all, what president would want to be affiliated with wealth destruction caused by falling stock prices? This is an idea that was floated by Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal in Thursday’s “Odd Lots” newsletter: Whereas bond market vigilantes are characterized by what they want to avoid (inflation), stock market vigilantes actually want something: higher profits. And also the higher the profits the better. Furthermore, the stock market is an important driver of wealth for millions of American households, and that also means an important driver of wealth for millions of American voters. When the stock market is down, people feel bad. When it’s up people feel good. If you’re an American politician (or President specifically), you’re forced to be sensitive to this in a very direct way if you want to be elected. It’s not really the same with bonds. The policy-markets nexus is just tighter with stocks.. While there are many aspects of the economy (like inflation and employment) that can be tricky to define and measure, stock prices are very unambiguous. People’s investment portfolio values are regularly updated down to the penny. I’d add that those voters with money in the stock market include the many billionaires with whom the incoming president has gotten cozy. And much of these billionaires’ wealth is tied up in the stock market. Assuming the president does not want to be associated with destroying the investor class’ wealth, this means his administration will likely think twice about going all-in on policies that could prove costly to the companies in the stock market. More from Joe: This probably puts a constraint on populist, anti-market interventions. You saw this when the trade war with China started heating up under the first Trump administration, and there were days when the market’s reaction was sharply negative to the headlines. Those tariffs didn’t have a massive economic impact, and they didn’t have a massive market impact. But it seems reasonable to think about what a much more aggressive tariff regime would have on equities.                                          ",

Factoring BOOT’s +5% raise to F2025E EPS guidance, the >25% correction in BOOT’s NTM P/E appears overdone given strong comps momentum and near-term visibility.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Yet firms like BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and TCW Group Inc. have issued a steady drumbeat of warnings that the bumpy ride is likely far from over. Trump’s coming return to the White House has significantly upended the outlook for the US Treasury market, where October’s losses had already wiped out much of this year’s gains. Less than two months after the Federal Reserve started pulling interest rates back from a more than two-decade high, the likelihood that Trump will cut taxes and throw up large tariffs is threatening to rekindle inflation by raising import costs and pouring stimulus on an already strong economy. His fiscal plans — unless offset by massive spending cuts — would also send the federal budget deficit surging. And that, in turn, has renewed doubts about whether bondholders will start demanding higher yields in return for absorbing an ever-rising supply of new Treasuries. One scenario is “the bond market instills fiscal discipline with an unpleasant rise in rates,” said Janet Rilling, senior portfolio manager and the head of the Plus Fixed Income team at Allspring Global Investments. She predicted the 10-year Treasury yield could rise back to the peak of 5% hit in late 2023, about 70 basis points above where it was Friday. That “was the cycle high and it’s a reasonable level if there is a full implementation of the proposed tariffs.” There remains considerable uncertainty about the precise policies Trump will enact, and some of the potential impact has already been priced in, since speculators started betting on his victory well ahead of the vote. While 10- and 30-year Treasury yields surged Wednesday to the highest in months, they came tumbling back down again over the next two days, ending the week lower than they began. A Bloomberg index of Treasury returns was up just 1.4% as of Friday’s close. There’s no cash Treasuries trading on Monday due to a US holiday. But the prospect that Trump’s policies will spur growth has driven traders to pare back expectations for how deeply the the Fed will cut rates next year, dashing hopes that bonds would rally as it eased policy aggressively. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and JPMorgan have shifted their Fed forecasts to show fewer reductions. Swaps traders are pricing in that policymakers will reduce its benchmark rate to 4% by mid-2025, a full percentage point higher than they were predicting in September. It’s in a range of 4.5% to 4.75% now.                                    ",

Tesla stock is up nearly 50% since the election, and on Friday, Tesla hit its highest closing price in over two years, topping $1 trillion in market value. As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reported, the president-elect has even promised Musk a position in his administration, suggesting he could head a commission to boost government efficiency. Meanwhile, hedge funds clinging to bets against the stock have lost massively over the past week. On Monday, Tesla shorts were down $8.72 billion in mark-to-market losses since Nov. 4, according to data analytics firm S3 Partners. Before the post-election rally, Tesla stock had lagged the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and trailed each of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers year to date. \"We expect continued short covering in TSLA stock due to the rally-induced short squeeze, which will force out many of the 2.4 million shares we saw shorted over the last month,\" S3 Partners head of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky told Yahoo Finance.

(SFTBY, 9984.T) swung to its biggest quarterly profit in two years on a series of successful Indian listings, giving its founder Masayoshi Son more ammunition for his next bet. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The Tokyo-based company earned a net income of ¥1.18 trillion ($7.7 billion) in the September quarter, compared with a net loss of ¥931 billion last year. Analysts projected on average a net income of about ¥295 billion for the period. The Vision Fund reported a gain of ¥373 billion, which was also bolstered by a lift in the values of companies like Didi Global Inc. (DIDIY) and Coupang Inc. (CPNG) A boom in India’s IPO market is buoying the Vision Fund, which for years struggled to win returns commensurate with its $100 billion-plus scale. Seven years since the investment unit’s launch, it’s reaping gains from the debuts of startups such as e-scooter maker Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. (OLAELEC.NS) and online retailer Brainbees Solutions Ltd. (FIRSTCRY.NS), which sells baby products under the brand name FirstCry. The SoftBank-backed food-delivery app Swiggy Ltd.’s imminent $1.3 billion IPO was subscribed more than three times. SoftBank is seeing a “harvest season in India,” Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte who publishes on SmartKarma, wrote in a note prior to the earnings release. It’s a rare moment of victory for an investment team that remains saddled with hundreds of loss-making startups. The Vision Fund posted two straight years of hefty losses on a collapse in startup valuations, before swinging to a mild profit in fiscal 2023. The fund, which sought to funnel private equity-sized bets into tiny companies, has had to scale back new investments until recently. SoftBank and the Vision Fund have since adopted a more targeted approach toward investing that focuses on generative AI. Their latest bets include OpenAI and Perplexity AI Inc. “Roughly half of the second-quarter gain comes from surfacing upside from Indian IPOs,” said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with Astris Advisory. “If the IPO pipeline in the US reopens and VF companies are in demand, there could be a mini-boom. But what they plan to do with AI is probably more important.” The positive earnings come as Son prepares for what appears to be a large-scale push into artificial intelligence and semiconductor investments. SoftBank has built up an enormous cash pile and the value of its assets excluding debt has soared with the share price of its chip affiliate Arm Holdings Plc. (ARM)         ",

        "body": "Trump could soften his economic agenda to appease investors, Wharton's Jeremy Siegel said. That's because Trump is \"the most pro-stock market president\" in history, Siegel told CNBC. Bond market investors have thrown a fit over some of Trump's proposals, Siegel added. Donald Trump might hesitate to carry out some of his sweeping economic agenda to avoid losing the approval of stock and bond investors, Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel said on Monday. . In an interview with CNBC, Siegel said he believed Trump would adopt a strong pro-market stance over his next term, even at the expense of some of his proposed economic policies. The top economist pointed to Trump's eagerness to point to the stock market as a measure of success in the past as a reason he might not want to upset the roaring bull market. \"President Trump is the most pro-stock market president we have had in our history,\" Siegel added. \"It seems to me very unlikely that he's going to implement policy that will be bad for the stock market.\" A reaction to some of Trump's proposed policies, which economists believe will add to the federal deficit and stoke higher inflation, was already seen in the bond market last week. Following the election, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury spiked past 4.4%, its highest level since July. Though yields have pulled back and stabilized since, Siegel said it's a sign that bond investors could be ready to protest any policies that pile on more government debt or fuel inflation. It could also be a sign investors are concerned over the potential for higher inflation, and are anticipating higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. \"I thought what happened on Wednesday after he won when those yields went up was a shot across the bow, saying, 'Hey, you know, just watch out what you do. We're there, and all the tax cuts you promised, we're very skeptical,'\" Siegel said. \"Both the bond market and the stock market are going to be really big constraints on many of Trump's programs.\" With a Republican-led Congress, Trump's proposal to extend his 2017 tax cut package looks like a \"slam dunk,\" Siegel noted, though he said anticipated challenges to Trump's other proposed tax cuts. If Trump were to implement all of his proposed cuts, yields could end up rising past 5%, Siegel predicted. \"So I think the trend of higher long-term rates is going to be with us,\" he added. Sigel added that the former president is also unlikely to wrest control from the Federal Reserve. Though Trump was reported to be making plans to exert more influence over the central bank's policy decisions, the move would probably prove unpopular with markets.   ",

Victor Benjamin, assistant professor of information systems at Arizona State University, said in an interview last month that \"the threat posed by AI-driven cyberattacks significantly differs from traditional cyberattacks in terms of sophistication and scalability.\" \"AI allows attackers to target a wide variety of systems, each with unique vulnerabilities, all at once,\" he said. \"What once required specialized expertise can now be done by novices using AI tools, making it easier for more people to launch attacks.\"                       ",

        "body": "By Ludwig Burger and Patricia Weiss FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Bayer's earnings will likely slip further next year on weak agricultural markets, the company said on Tuesday, pummelling its shares and piling more pressure on its chief executive to deliver on turnaround efforts. CEO Bill Anderson has launched a push to cut jobs, speed up decision making and slash corporate bureaucracy to turn around the embattled industrial group, while putting plans to break up its diversified businesses on hold. \"Overall, we expect a muted outlook on top and bottom line next year with likely declining earnings,\" Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Nickl said in the German group's quarterly earnings statement. Shares fell 8.4% to 22.37 euros, their lowest in almost 20 years, in early trading. Based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for special items, the 2025 guidance would mean a third consecutive annual decline, after the group on Tuesday also lowered its projection for this year. Bayer said that the earnings measure, when adjusted for the impact of currency swings, would likely come in at between 10.4 billion euros ($11.1 billion) and 10.7 billion euros, down from a previous forecast of 10.7-11.3 billion euros and last year's 11.7 billion. \"We’ve rapidly scaled the new operating model and significantly levelled up the Pharma pipeline,\" Anderson said in the statement, also citing strong launch dynamics of new drugs Nubeqa for prostate cancer and Kerendia for kidney disease. The group's July-to-September EBITDA, adjusted for one-off items, fell almost 26% to 1.25 billion euros, missing the average analyst estimate of 1.31 billion euros posted on the company's website, with Bayer citing weak agricultural markets in Latin America. Bayer's $63 billion purchase of seeds and pesticides maker Monsanto under Anderson's predecessor in 2018 was a long-term bet on robust growth in farming supplies markets which has so far proven elusive. Debt and costly U.S. product liability litigation over disputed claims that weedkiller Roundup causes cancer are further burdens from the takeover which Anderson is struggling to shake off. According to recent earnings reports, U.S. agrichemicals competitor Corteva and the agriculture unit of domestic rival BASF have also been hit by lower prices as weak produce prices weighed on farmers' demand. Bayer added that special charges of 4.1 billion euros, mainly from write-downs on intangible assets in its Crop Science division, resulted in a quarterly net loss of 4.18 billion euros, compared with a loss of 4.57 billion euros a year earlier.

The onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index slid 1.1%. The offshore yuan fell as much as 0.4% to 7.2534 per dollar, the weakest in more than three months. Stock losses deepened in the afternoon following reports that US President-elect Donald Trump is poised to pick two men with track records of harshly criticizing China for key positions in his new administration. That bolstered concerns over geopolitical tensions. Sentiment had already been cooling with China’s underwhelming fiscal stimulus announcement last week and a slower-than-expected credit expansion for October. “Trump’s preference to strengthen his negotiating positions with aggressive appointments like these should not be a surprise,” but underscores the high likelihood of the president-elect following through on his campaign pledge to implement punitive tariffs on China’s exports to the US, said Homin Lee, senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier. Senator Marco Rubio — who has taken an aggressive stance on China’s emergence as an economic power and twice been hit with sanctions by Beijing — is expected to be named secretary of state, Bloomberg News reported. Representative Mike Waltz, who views China as a “greater threat” to the US than any other nation, is in line to be national security advisor. Chinese equities have struggled to regain traction after peaking in early October, with the economic recovery remaining wobbly and the government reluctant to roll out large-scale fiscal stimulus to revive domestic demand. In a highly-anticipated legislative meeting last week, authorities focused on fixing local governments’ debt woes and stopped short of unleashing fresh policy to boost consumption. The outcome disappointed some investors who had hoped for stronger economic support, especially given the threat of higher tariffs under Trump. Some traders may also be taking money off the table as the market’s outlook remains unclear. Major onshore benchmarks including the CSI 300 Index and the Shanghai Composite gauge are trading near overbought levels.            ",

Beyond the initial market pop driven by investors interpreting the election of Republican Donald Trump as bullish for markets, Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research at CFRA, anticipates a more business-friendly environment under Trump. “This is generally bullish for ETFs,” Ullal said. “One of the factors driving the initial rally is the expectation of less regulations around financials and energy, but there are also expectations that the strength of the stock market could broaden into small- and mid-cap stocks.” Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at Infrastructure Capital in New York City, also sees a Trump presidency as bullish for smaller U.S. companies. “This is definitely bullish for small caps, but it is really more about specific sectors than market capitalization,” he said. Hatfield noted that it is a common misconception that smaller companies in general are more leveraged and therefore more interest rate-sensitive. “Smaller companies are de facto interest rate sensitive because the sectors of the index tend to be lower in technology and higher in financials and real estate and other companies that do better when we’re not in Fed tightening cycle,” he said. “But right now, we’re in a Fed loosening cycle, and we’re more optimistic about rates than the market because we think most of Trump’s policies are disinflationary.” One of the shifts Hatfield expects under Trump is a Federal Trade Commission that will encourage consolidation. “The most important thing to think about is that small companies are acquisition targets, but the FTC has been putting a lid on consolidation,” Hatfield said. Then, there is the potential for a reduced corporate tax rate, down to 15% from the current 21%. “There will be a new tax bill, and a corporate tax reduction will be in that bill,” said Hatfield, who expects the S&P 500 Index to gain 25% next year. “And we think small caps will beat that 25%,” he added. Ullal said the initial rally of financial sector stocks following last week’s election was in response to a more relaxed regulatory environment, considering the Republican track record of being “less hawkish on antitrust action.” Another factor supporting small-cap stocks is the valuation levels of large-cap stocks, illustrated by the S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.3, compared to a historical average of 16. Small- and mid-cap stocks, meanwhile, have forward p/es of around 17, which is in line with their historical averages.    ",

That's all played havoc with Tesla short-sellers, who had bet against the group heading into last month's third-quarter earnings report. Data from S3 Partners indicated mark-to-market losses of around $5.2 billion for short bets between Election Day and the close of trading Friday. Bloomberg/Getty Images The opposite, and more lucrative, Tesla bet was wagered earlier this year by Musk himself, according to the Wedbush analysts and longtime Tesla bull Dan Ives, who sees a Trump White House as a \"gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years.\" A Trump administration is also likely to revamp the broader electric-vehicle landscape by imposing strict tariffs on cars made overseas and removing some of the tax credits and rebates that have unpinned the profit potential for newer market entrants such as Ford Motor  (F)  and General Motors  (GM) . \"The stakes were high after Musk spent more than $130 million to help elect Donald Trump and other Republicans this election cycle, according to filings,\" said CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson. \"Depending on the outcome of the House, we also see risks to current electric vehicle tax credits from changes to existing tax legislation, which we think will widen Tesla's competitive moat by making competing EV models even more uneconomic, as we believe Tesla is the only profitable manufacturer of EVs,\" he added.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks in Hong Kong declined after a high-profile legislative meeting let down some investors who had been hoping for large-scale stimulus to revive domestic demand and combat deflation. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost as much as 2.9% before paring some of its losses, with property and consumer-related shares among the biggest losers. The CSI 300 Index was volatile, reversing an earlier loss of 1.4% to end the day 0.7% higher. A Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of Chinese developer shares briefly tumbled more than 6%. The mixed reactions came as investors digested Beijing’s latest stimulus package, which relieved some of the debt burden on local governments but lacked the sweeping fiscal support many investors had hoped for. The results proved somewhat anti-climactic given the heightened policy expectations ahead of the meeting. Donald Trump’s election victory, which could lead to higher tariffs on China, has also added to the uncertainty over China’s economy. Economic data released over the weekend increased the sense of urgency for those who think Beijing needs to do more to encourage growth. Consumer price inflation remained close to zero and factory-gate prices continued to fall. UBS lowered its 2025 growth forecast for China following Trump’s election, telling investors it expected the economy to expand “around 4%” in 2025 and at a “considerably lower” pace in 2026. “With perceived emphasis on stabilization rather than stimulus, and no measures to facilitate bank recapitalization and/or boost consumption, we think this will come as a disappointment for stock investors, even though the headline debt-swap numbers were ahead of expectations,” Nomura Holdings Inc. strategists led by Chetan Seth wrote in a note. Overseas companies are pulling their money out of China as the growth outlook turns gloomier. Foreign direct investment slid almost $13 billion in the first nine months of the year, a sign that some investors are still pessimistic even as Beijing rolls out stimulus measures aimed at stabilizing growth. Some market watchers say China is likely preserving policy room to prepare for an unfavorable trade environment once Trump takes office. The US president-elect has threatened 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. At a Friday briefing following the Standing Committee meeting of the National People’s Congress, Finance Minister Lan Fo’an promised “more forceful” fiscal policy next year.            ",

        "body": "The S&P 500's (^GSPC) surge to record highs since Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election is showing no signs of stopping. And Wall Street strategists have been quick to update their outlooks on where stocks may be headed next. On Monday, Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni wrote in a note to clients that he expects the S&P 500 to hit 6,100 by the end of 2024, about 2% above current levels. Yardeni then sees the index reaching 7,000 by the end of 2025, 8,000 by the end of 2026, and 10,000 by the end of the decade. Previously, Yardeni told Yahoo Finance he'd seen the S&P 500 hitting 8,000 by the end of the decade. \"We're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,\" Yardeni told Yahoo Finance. \"And not only for corporations but also for individuals. Lots of various kinds of tax cuts have been discussed. And in addition to that, a lot of deregulation.\" In his note, Yardeni wrote the market is showing early signs of \"animal spirits\" coming into play. Key to Yardeni's call is a boost to his earnings estimates and margin projections for the S&P 500 due to Trump's policies. The earnings estimates assume Trump will \"quickly lower the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%.\" Yardeni's decade-end forecast would mark a return of about 66% from current levels, or about 11% annually, roughly in line with the long-term average annual return of the S&P 500. There are concerns, like sticky inflation readings, which may prompt investors to question whether the Federal Reserve will stop cutting interest rates. And others, like the team at Goldman Sachs — which recently called for a 3% annual return for the S&P 500 over the next decade — have reasoned that, eventually, the bull market will turn into a bear. \"We aren't saying that a recession can't occur over the rest of the decade,\" Yardeni wrote in his note to clients. \"However, we note that despite the significant tightening of monetary policy during 2022 through 2024, there has been no recession. Why should there be one over the remainder of the Roaring 2020s?\" Research from FactSet on Friday, showed the S&P 500 is already trading at 22.2 times 2025 earnings estimates. This is above the five-year average of 19.6 and the 20-year average of 15.8. High valuations and frothy sentiment are among the reasons some have argued the market could be due for a correction, or at least more modest returns going forward. But strategists often point out that high valuations on their own aren't often a reason to sell. \"Multiples are likely to be elevated when investors believe that earnings can grow faster for longer because a recession is less likely in the foreseeable future,\" Yardeni wrote.

        "body": "Li Auto (LI) stock is down more than 7% in Friday’s trading session. The selloff appeared to be a direct reaction to the U.S. election result, with president-elect Donald Trump vowing to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. However, Li Auto doesn’t export to the U.S. and doesn’t have plans to. As such, I think the selloff is unwarranted. More broadly, I think the stock is oversold and undervalued based on projected earnings growth. That’s why I’m bullish. Donald Trump is the president-elect and tariffs are going to be headline news when he takes to the White House. While his exact plans for vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) are uncertain, the former president said he’d look to implement tariffs of 100% or even 200% on Chinese-made vehicles entering the U.S. market. This aggressive stance is part of Trump’s broader strategy to protect the American auto industry and address concerns about Chinese competition. Of course, tariffs aren’t good for Chinese auto companies exporting to the U.S. In fact, a 100% tariff would almost certainly make any vehicle uncompetitive against a like-for-life peer. Analysts have hypothesized that Trump’s tariffs aim to force Chinese automakers to produce in the U.S. or will be used as a bargaining chip for other concessions. However, a reason why I am bullish on Li Auto is because its global expansion strategy appears to be focused on markets outside the United States, with a particular emphasis on the Middle East. According to reports, the company planned to enter overseas markets starting in 2024, targeting countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia. More recently, Li Auto’s CEO, Li Xiang, indicated that the company’s immediate plans do not include international expansion before 2025, with the boss stating, “We have no plans to expand globally until 2025.” Reports now suggest that the company has pushed its export plan back further, focusing on its position in the Chinese luxury EV market. This lack of appetite to export could be seen as a sensible option. The Chinese EV market is the biggest globally, with sales surging 82% in 2023 and capturing nearly 60% of global EV purchases. Overall, China’s EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.15% from 2024 to 2030. Although I am bullish on Li auto, there are risks worth considering. Of course, there is an issue about being geographically focused on one country — even if it represents 20% of the global population — and that’s a form of concentration risk. China’s economy is widely considered to be faltering, and more economic stimulus will likely be required to enhance domestic demand.          ",

They helped power the S&P 500’s Utilities index (XLU) to all-time highs — the index is on track to outperform the S&P 500's equal-weighted counterpart (^SPXEW) in 7 of the past 10 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And Vistra (VST), a nuclear power company, recently surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) year to date. Big Tech firms, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG), drove the gains, announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in nuclear power names over the course of several weeks. It’s a story the market ran with. Then came a regulatory wrist slap that briefly stopped the nuclear energy rally in its tracks. In a 2-to-1 ruling on Nov. 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a request from Talen Energy (TLN) to increase the power it could provide Amazon from its Susquehanna power plant, citing concerns about grid reliability and energy affordability. Several nuclear energy stocks, including Talen, Oklo (OKLO), Centrus Energy (LEU), Vistra (VST), and NuScale Power (SMR), tumbled the following Monday. Amazon is expected to petition the decision, according to CFRA analyst Daniel Rich. But for investors, “it certainly is a setback,” Rich said. Rich explained that co-location agreements have become a major focus for the tech industry, as they allow hyperscalers to buy power directly from an existing energy source for their data centers. This enables them to build more data centers at speed and at lower costs. But these agreements may be a sticking point for regulators, which is why Big Tech has pursued other strategies, such as creating new sources of nuclear energy through small modular reactors (SMRs). Though there are currently no SMRs in the United States, companies like Amazon see them as a way to affordably add to the power grid while also meeting the increased energy demands AI requires. \"The order may not represent a long-term risk,\" ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox told Yahoo Finance. \"It’s more that FERC may have punted or didn’t want to set a precedent about co-location until it had firm policy.\" Clay Sell, the CEO of nuclear reactor designer X-energy, told Yahoo Finance that “a significant portion of the increased electricity demand in the US for the next 25 years is going to come from AI.”           ",

Recommended Reading Karuna, Cerevel might be just the start of psychiatry drug M&A Through a recent, nearly $9 billion acquisition, AbbVie surged to the front of a new wave of antipsychotic drugs that Wall Street expects to become big sellers. But on Monday, the company’s plans came crashing down. AbbVie said the main asset it got from its purchase of Cerevel Therapeutics, an experimental medication called emraclidine, had failed across two clinical trials. The mid-stage studies, which could have provided the most concrete evidence yet that the drug helps alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia, instead found it not significantly better than a placebo. The “flat out” failure, as one analyst described it, took investors by surprise. AbbVie shares were down more than 12% Monday, erasing roughly $40 billion in value. Among large pharmaceutical companies, it’s one of the larger single-day stock price dips of at least the past several quarters. Meanwhile, shares of Bristol Myers Squibb, which sells a medicine that emraclidine would have competed against, rose around 12%. Bristol Myers got the medicine, now sold as Cobenfy, through a $14 billion deal for Karuna Therapeutics that closed in March. AbbVie’s acquisition “just went up in flames,” according to Olivia Brayer, an analyst at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald who covers Bristol Myers. And in a note to clients, Stifel analyst Paul Matteis wrote that emraclidine’s failure is “outright surprising” and will “significantly bolster” Bristol Myers’ leading position with Cobenfy. Both Cobenfy and emraclidine are part of a fresh class of antipsychotic medications designed to boost “muscarinic receptors,” a type of protein that tunes brain chemistry. Earlier antipsychotics all work by directly regulating dopamine, a vital brain-cell-signaling chemical that can cause disorders when there’s too much or too little of it. Muscarinic drugs affect dopamine, too, but in a more roundabout way. Multiple mid- to late-stage trials have shown Cobenfy can quickly alleviate schizophrenia symptoms while avoiding some of the more troubling side effects seen with its predecessors, such as weight gain or sedation. An earlier, much smaller study of emraclidine also found two different doses demonstrated “clinically meaningful antipsychotic activity.”        ",

Nvidia (NVDA) , which last week overtook Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company measured by market capitalization, also replaced struggling chipmaker Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as its stunning 2024 gain topped 205%. The group is slated to report on Wednesday, Nov. 20, with analysts looking for a massive year-on-year revenue surge of 82%, to just under $33 billion, thanks in part to ongoing demand for its legacy Hopper chips and gains from its newly released line of Blackwell processors.

Nvidia's grip on the market for so-called AI accelerators, which power the large datasets and language models used by companies such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) , Microsoft (MSFT) , Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) , likely means it will also guide investors to impress revenue gains over the coming year as well.

Aquis, a challenger stock exchange that provides small companies with access to capital markets, has agreed to a takeover by Zurich-based Six Swiss Exchange Group in a deal worth £194m. Mr Ricci, a colourful City figure and racehorse owner, is one of the largest shareholders in Aquis. He holds a stake of roughly 8pc in the exchange, meaning he stands to make £15.54m from the deal. The windfall will come as a fresh boost for Mr Ricci, who took over as chief executive of Panmure Liberum after the two investment banks combined in a mega-merger at the beginning of this year. The US-born executive previously led Barclays’ investment banking arm and was one of the so-called “three musketeers” in the bank’s pre-financial crash heyday, alongside Bob Diamond and Jerry del Missier. He secured £44m in pay and share bonuses when he left Barclays in 2013 and now has an estimated net worth of around £100m. Mr Ricci, who reportedly referred to himself as the “maddest f----r on the planet”, is also known for his love of horse-racing and tweed three-piece suits. The trilby-wearing banker named one of his horses “Fat Cat in the Hat” and made £400,000 in one day at the Cheltenham Festival in 2016 after three of his horses won. Six has agreed to pay 727p per share for Aquis, marking a 120pc premium to its closing price at the end of last week. The companies said the deal will help the challenger stock market to expand across Europe. Aquis was founded in 2012 with the aim of targeting fast-growing businesses. Brewers Adnams and Shepherd Neame, and horseracing firm Newbury Racecourse are among the companies listed on the exchange. The group also offers trading products and has a technology division focused on infrastructure for financial markets. Aquis, which is itself listed on the London Stock Exchange, has grown its revenue by almost 500pc since its initial public offering and posted a £5.2m profit last year. It is based in London but has an additional office in Paris, employing 88 staff in total. Six owns the Spanish stock exchanges, as well as operating Switzerland’s main market. It said the acquisition would help it serve customers in Switzerland, Spain and internationally. Alasdair Haynes, founder and chief executive of Aquis, said: “I am immensely proud of the business we have built over the past 12 years. “Since launching as a start-up subscription based exchange in 2012, Aquis has become a diversified multi-product European exchange group that creates and facilitates more efficient markets for a modern economy.

        "body": "Public companies need to meet certain requirements for their stocks to be traded — or listed — on stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. If a company fails to meet those requirements, the stock can be delisted from the exchange. For example, in 2019, shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) were delisted after failing to meet certain financial reporting deadlines. Nasdaq approved the company’s application for relisting in early 2020, but the risk of another delisting surfaced in November 2024 after Super Micro again missed reporting deadlines and its auditor resigned. Here’s what investors should know about stock delistings. Delisting is when a company’s stock is removed from a stock exchange such as the NYSE or the Nasdaq. A delisting may occur for several different reasons. It could be the result of the company going private, declaring bankruptcy, merging with another company or failing to meet the exchange’s listing requirements. If a company’s stock is delisted from an exchange, shareholders still own their shares in the company, but the stock may trade over-the-counter, which could lead to decreased liquidity and less transparency for investors. Exchanges have certain requirements that companies must comply with to be listed. If a company fails to meet these standards, they could face being delisted from the exchange. Typically, the exchange sends a notice to the company that it is not in compliance with the exchange’s listing requirements, which serves as a warning before the actual delisting. The company may be given a period of time to come back into compliance with the exchange’s rules, but if it doesn’t, its stock will be delisted. Companies can apply for relisting once they meet the exchange’s requirements. Each exchange has its own listing requirements, but these are some of the common reasons a company may face delisting: Failure to meet financial requirements: Exchanges have certain financial requirements that companies must meet in order to be listed such as minimum levels of net income or shareholder’s equity. Failure to file financial reports on time: Companies must meet financial reporting deadlines when filing quarterly and annual reports. Bankruptcy: If a company files for bankruptcy, its stock may be removed from an exchange. Fraud: Legal issues or strong evidence that a company has committed accounting or financial fraud may lead to a delisting. Failure to meet trading requirements: Exchanges require a company’s stock to meet certain price and volume requirements over a period of time. Poor corporate governance: Failure to meet certain governance requirements, such as having an adequate audit committee or having independent directors on the board, could lead to delisting.     ",

Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration More than $1.9 billion flooded into the $13 billion iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (ticker MTUM) on Friday, the biggest one-day flow since the fund’s 2013 launch, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At the same time, a record $1 billion exited from the $32.5 billion iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF (IUSB). A BlackRock spokesperson confirmed that the firm adjusted its model portfolio allocations last week. The influx of funds into MTUM reflects BlackRock’s conviction that US equities — fresh off their best weekly performance of 2024 — will continue to climb as a “coiled spring” of pent-up business activity unwinds. With election uncertainty resolved, decisions on corporate capital allocations that were formerly on hold will resume. As such, the firm’s model portfolio team, which oversees about $131 billion in assets, is increasing its overweight on stocks from 3% to 4% heading into year-end. “Rather than attempting to thread the needle with tactical sector or industry bets tied to specific electoral outcomes, we’re positioning for a broader relief rally that we believe will transcend partisan results,” Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite wrote in investment commentary dated Nov. 8. “This ‘uncertainty discount’ embedded in market prices should begin to thaw as businesses and investors regain their footing and seek to execute on delayed strategic initiatives.” Model portfolios — which package together funds into ready-made strategies to sell to advisers — have ballooned in size in recent years. Broadridge Financial Solutions estimates that model assets likely reached $5.1 trillion at the end of 2023, and could reach $11 trillion by 2028. As a result, even small adjustments can cause big shifts in ETF flows. In addition to post-vote clarity, Gates wrote that recent economic data — showing that the labor market is cooling while growth remains resilient — should support the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting campaign, adding to the firm’s bullish conviction.

        "body": "By Jaspreet Kalra MUMBAI (Reuters) - Global investors are likely to find relative safety in India's financial markets from the spillover of Donald Trump's economic policies, including from any protectionist trade policies that could spark emerging market volatility. Trump's decisive election victory last week and his impending return to the White House next month has raised significant uncertainty for investors. However, India's strong economic growth, limited exposure to Chinese and the U.S. consumer market, robust local appetite for equities and a central bank devoted to ensuring currency stability will bolster the country's appeal amid global unease, investors and analysts say. Stocks in Asia's third-largest economy are also likely to find support from strong domestic buying due to Indian companies' limited reliance on export revenues. That's significant as markets fear Trump will reintroduce his 'America First' policies, raising the spectre of a global trade war. China is at the frontline of risk as the former president has threatened tariffs of 60% or more on all Chinese imports, which is likely to heap more pressure on the world's second-biggest economy. Tariffs on China are expected to negatively impact export-oriented Asian economies, according to analysts at Societe Generale, who see India as better positioned than Korea and Taiwan to cope with the fallout. \"Without any major fiscal announcement, China is likely to face downward pressure from Trump's victory,\" said Sat Duhra, a Hong Kong based portfolio manager on the Asia (ex-Japan) equity team at Janus Henderson Investors. Some investors had pivoted away from India to buy Chinese stocks last month but \"there could be a reversion back to India in a quicker than expected time frame\" because of its status as a safe haven, Duhra said. While foreign investors pulled out a record $11.2 billion from Indian equities in October, domestic institutional investors' stock purchases rose to an all-time high of about $12.7 billion in the same month, limiting the benchmark indexes' fall. Domestic investors see India benefiting from supply chain diversification of U.S. companies, in sectors like electronic manufacturing, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, said Trideep Bhattacharya, president and chief investment officer for equities at Edelweiss Mutual Fund. India's economic fortunes have also shifted since the last Trump presidency when GDP was slower versus a robust 8.2% pace in the most recent financial year ended March 2024.         ",

Tesla shares took off on expectations of benefits from the Trump win, plus a big jump in its price target by Wedbush analysts. AbbVie reported disappointing results from a trial of its experimental schizophrenia drug.  The market surge from enthusiasm over Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election last week continued at midday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping above 44,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 also advanced, while the Nasdaq was little changed. Tesla (TSLA) shares again were driven higher by the election results on expectations of a reduction in federal regulations and CEO Elon Musk's ties to the incoming administration as an adviser to the president-elect. In addition, shares got an extra boost when Wedbush raised its price target by $100, calling the Trump victory a \"gamechanger\" for the EV maker. With Trump having said he wants to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet,\" companies tied to cryptocurrencies soared as bitcoin traded at an all-time high. Shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD), Coinbase Global (COIN), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Marathon Digital parent MARA Holdings (MARA) all jumped more than 10%. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares also soared when the largest corporate holder of bitcoin said that it had paid $2.03 billion to purchase an additional 27,200 bitcoin. Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 when Edgewater Research warned that Nvidia (NVDA) has canceled orders with the power solutions company.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 reversed early gains to decline 0.6% in afternoon trading to 39,289.14, weighed down by uncertainty about how Trump's policies, including tariffs, may affect local industries. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.1% to 8,255.60. South Korea's Kospi declined 1.6% to 2,490.19. Chinese tech stocks have been declining lately, while investors also have their eyes on upcoming earnings reports out of China. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2.9% to 19,839.88, the first time the index fell below 20,000 points since China announced a stimulus package in September. The Shanghai Composite lost 1.2% to 3,429.42. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 edged up by 0.1%, coming off its best week of the year following Trump’s victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 304 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.1%. Tesla was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500 after rising 9.1%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump’s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising. Several pieces of what’s known as the “Trump trade” also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1%, and financial stocks again helped lead the market on expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions. A White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It’s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn’t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna’s stock rose 7.3%, and Humana’s sank 2%. Stocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1.5% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they’re seen as benefiting more from Trump’s America First policies than big multinational companies. They helped offset a drop of 1.6% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market. Such Big Tech stocks have rocketed higher on excitement about artificial-intelligence technology, and they had been gaining almost regardless of what the economy was doing. Now, though, critics say their prices look too expensive, and investors are finding more interesting buys among companies that could benefit more from Trump’s second term.          ",

US stocks were higher on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping about 300 points while the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 edged slightly higher.

Crypto investors continued to celebrate Trump's win, which the market expects to be a positive catalyst amid the President-Elect's promises of policies aimed at boosting the sector. Meanwhile, tech shares mostly slumped, with shares of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft, the world's three largest companies, all down about 1%. Investors' top concern this week is inflation data, with consumer price index data for the month of October set to be released Wednesday morning. Economists expect a 2.5% year-over-year jump in CPI, compared to a rise of 2.4% in the prior month. \"While economic fundamentals suggest inflation should continue to moderate, policy changes pose an upside risk to the outlook. Nevertheless, we think the October CPI report will be good enough for the Fed to follow through with a 25bp cut in December,\" Bank of America said on Monday. In addition to inflation data, corporate earnings remain on investors' radars, though they are starting to wind down. So far, 91% of S&P 500 companies have reported third-quarter results. Of those companies, 77% beat profit estimates by a median of 6%, while 59% beat revenue estimates by a median of 6%, according to data from Fundstrat. Nvidia is the last big company that will report earnings. The chip giant is scheduled to report its third-quarter results after the market close on November 20.

President-elect Trump could dial back some of his proposed policies in a bid to not upset the stock market, Jeremy Siegel said. Economists say Trump could give Americans the very thing they voted against. Bitcoin surged past the $80,000 price level over the weekend and hit a high of $82,500.

China’s latest measures to kick-start its economy — a debt-swap plan — stopped short of direct stimulus, and inflation remains weak in the top iron ore user. Iron ore’s slide on Tuesday came amid a broad retreat in commodities, with a gauge of the US dollar holding close to its highest level in a year. That makes raw materials priced in the currency more expensive for most buyers. The steel-making ingredient is one of the year’s worst performing major commodities, losing more than a quarter of its value, as China’s economy slows despite government efforts to arrest the slide and fix a drawn-out property-sector crisis. Top miners, meanwhile, have been boosting flows, and Chinese port inventories are at their highest ever for this time of year. “Iron ore, and base metal prices, will likely rise and fall in line with market speculation of Chinese stimulus over the next six months,” Vivek Dhar, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note. Still, iron ore’s ability to sustain deeply negative mill margins in China without materially falling has been “eye‑opening,” he said, referring to the relative resilience of prices even as steel mills make losses. The drop came despite a Bloomberg report that China is planning to cut taxes on home purchases, potentially aiding the property market. Regulators are working on a plan to allow so-called mega cities to cut the deed tax for buyers to as low as 1%, according to people familiar with the matter.

Leftist leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told broadcaster RedeTV! \"I beat them once and I will win again,\" after market jitters over the sustainability of Brazil's public finances sent the local currency tumbling and interest rate futures soaring. Brazil's real has recently dropped to its weakest against the dollar since March 2021, piling pressure on the government to introduce spending cuts quickly to show it is committed to fiscal discipline. \"I am in a very, very serious discussion process with the government... We can no longer play, every time we have to cut spending, on the shoulders of the people most in need,\" Lula said. \"It's a responsibility of the executive, it's a responsibility of the judiciary. I want to know if they are also willing to give up what is excessive, I want to know if Congress is also willing to cut spending,\" Lula added. Lula's has typically viewed spending on things like education and social security as investments rather than expenses, but many economists have warned the fiscal framework will become unsustainable unless changes are made. Even the central bank underscored the need for fiscal discipline to counter inflation as it accelerated the pace of monetary tightening at its last meeting. The fiscal framework combines primary budget targets with a cap for overall spending growth to a certain threshold above inflation. However, with many mandatory expenses - such as social benefits and pensions - growing at a faster rate, the framework restricts room for investments and operational spending.

It’s coming to that time of the year again, when all the pundits and experts start pumping out their predictions on what to watch for in the year ahead, and how things will change over the coming 12 months. Which, this year, is going to include a lot of inaccurate predictions about AI. Generative AI is a transformative tech trend, no doubt, which will have impact in a range of ways. But the conflation between the generative AI tools we have now, and computer systems that can actually think for themselves is significantly overblown. We’re not close to automated general intelligence (AGI) yet. Just because ChatGPT can pass an IQ test, that doesn’t mean that it’s actually “thinking” independently. But this is an aside, what we’re looking at here is social media predictions, and how the social media landscape will shift over the next year. And while AI will get the spotlight here as well, I’m tipping that the impacts will be more measured than many expect. Here’s what I see coming in 2025 from all the major social apps. And worth noting, I’m usually pretty spot-on with my estimates (check my 2024 predictions here). Still the biggest social platform in the world, despite it losing some of its cool status, Meta’s flagship app continues to host the most active users, by a big margin, and remains a critical connector for many, many communities. Though its focus has shifted of late, moving away from playing into your social graph, to showing you more and more entertainment-based content. As well as AI, with Meta looking to get people excited about its AI tools by adding in random prompts for you to “Imagine a toga party for animated characters”, or some other rubbish in-stream. I’m not sure that’s the future of social media engagement, but then again, Meta’s pretty good at capitalizing on rising tech trends. Here’s what’s likely coming next for Zuck’s social behemoth. More AI (for some reason) As noted, Meta has made a big commitment to gen AI, spending billions on infrastructure to support its AI push. Once, it was the metaverse that was Meta’s key focus for the next stage, but the rapid rise of new AI tools seems to have sidelined that to a degree, with Zuck and Co. looking to get on the AI bandwagon, and lead the AI race. Which, in fairness, they’ve been working on for over a decade. Meta’s really looking to get in on the latest AI push because it’s put in the work on AI already, and now, with others like OpenAI gaining traction, it sees its opportunity to also stake its claim.

The token was initially issued on Oct. 19 and has been languishing around a $20 million market cap over the weekend. The listing led to an explosion of trading volume with $293 million being recorded on decentralized exchange Raydium and $60 million on Binance, its market cap had increased to $422 million at press time. The rally comes alongside a fresh record high for bitcoin {{BTC}} with the original cryptocurrency trading at $82,120 amid a period of renewed optimism after the U.S. elected crypto-friendly Donald Trump as president. Memecoins have led the market-wide surge this week with dogecoin {{DOGE}} and dogwifhat {{WIF}} rising by 21% and 22% respectively. ACT is based on a Discord server that features several AI chatbots, which can respond to questions and also discuss topics amongst themselves. The server was created by a group of X users, one of which has already distanced themself from the token after selling their stash. Binance also listed a more conventional memecoin, peanut the squirrel (PNUT), which is trading at a $450 million market cap after rising by 344% on the listing. Memecoins are volatile by nature can often swing in price dramatically due to varying amounts of liquidity. Two percent market depth on Binance for ACT is currently just $93,000 to the downside and $214,000 to the upside, which means that a market sell order of just $100,000 would move the price to the downside by more than 2%, according to CoinMarketCap.

Buyers, mostly in wealthier countries, would be able to meet their climate goals by buying credits from projects that cut pollution. The rules, dubbed “Article 6.4” after the initial proposals under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, stipulate how countries should trade carbon credits through a UN-operated marketplace. They have been log jammed in recent years due to disagreements on their integrity, or how to make sure that any promised emissions reductions are additional and can be easily verified. COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev said today at the opening session at Baku in Azerbaijan that a final agreement on Article 6 is “long overdue” and called it critical to “ensure that protecting the planet pays.” Negotiators still need to agree on rules for Article 6.2, which sets the framework for bilateral trades. “By matching buyers and sellers efficiently, such markets could reduce the cost of implementing NDCs by 250 billion dollars a year,” Babayev said. “In a world where every dollar counts, that is essential.” NDCs, or nationally determined contribution, are the plan individual countries put foward to meet their share of the global targets enshrined in the Paris agreement. Climate groups were hesitant in welcoming the new rules, which they said still had “significant issues.” Carbon Market Watch said that one key issue was over how projects would deal with so-called reversal risks, where stored carbon leaks back into the atmosphere, such as through fire. Kicking off COP29 with a “back-door deal” sets a poor precedent for transparency and proper governance, said Isa Mulder, a policy expert on global carbon markets for Carbon Market Watch. “If these texts can be adopted in this way, where do we draw the line.” Listen on Zero: The World Needs Climate Leadership.

For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 6%. In the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), and Disney (DIS) will highlight another week of earnings reports. In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts. \"We don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance,\" Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year. The first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain. \"The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. The final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.3%. Entering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%.                               ",

The global wellness market continues to gain ground, increasing from $4.6 trillion in 2020 to $5.8 trillion in 2022 and reaching a record $6.3 trillion in 2023, according to new findings from the Global Wellness Institute. The market’s growth is expected to accelerate in coming years, reaching $9 trillion in 2028, GWI forecasted. Growth in the wellness tourism sector, specifically, will bolster the market’s expansion. Wellness tourism is expected to grow 10.2% from 2023 to 2028, per GWI. To cater to an increasing number of wellness travelers, hotels are expanding their amenities, services and design. The wellness tourism sector is slated to reach $1.35 billion in 2028, according to GWI. Among other sectors of the wellness market, wellness tourism will have the third-largest growth rate during the five-year period. Spas, meanwhile, are expected to grow 6.1% from 2023 to 2028. According to GWI, there are two kinds of wellness travelers: primary wellness travelers, whose trip or destination choice is primarily motivated by wellness; and secondary wellness travelers, who simply seek to maintain wellness while traveling. Several resort brands that target primary wellness travelers are expanding in the U.S., including IHG's Six Senses, offering properties that are wellness destinations in and of themselves. Also catering to that group is SBE’s newly launched longevity-focused resort brand, The Estate Hotels & Residences, which will pair luxury hospitality with longevity centers that leverage preventative medicine and AI. To court secondary wellness travelers, meanwhile, some hotels have added wellness-focused amenities. Choice Hotels International, for example, revamped its Sleep Inn prototype to include enhanced fitness centers, water refill stations and designated outdoor spaces. And Hilton’s lifestyle Tempo brand offers wellness-oriented rooms with Peloton bikes. Select hotels are also using technology to enhance spa services and air quality in rooms. One wellness travel trend that will continue to gain popularity in 2025 is sleep tourism, Hilton projects. More than 1 in 4 travelers will book a spa or wellness treatment to enhance their sleep while on vacation next year, according to the 2025 Hilton Trends Report. ",

        "body": "Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) will release earnings results for the third quarter, before the opening bell, on Tuesday, Nov. 12. Analysts expect the Atlanta-based retailer to report quarterly earnings at $3.64 per share. That’s down from $3.81 per share in the year-ago period. Home Depot projects to report quarterly revenue of $39.17 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro. On Friday, Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman upgraded the rating for Home Depot from Market Perform to Outperform and raised the price target from $360 to $455. With the recent buzz around Home Depot ahead of quarterly earnings, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. Home Depot currently offers an annual dividend yield of 2.22%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of $2.25 per share ($9.00 a year). To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Home Depot, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Home Depot's $9.00 dividend: $6,000 / $9.00 = 667 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $270,735 worth of Home Depot, or 667 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $9.00 = 133 shares, or $53,985 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. View more earnings on HD Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. HD Price Action: Shares of Home Depot gained by 1.6% to close at $405.90 on Friday.

Yardeni says the market's euphoria will continue amid favorable policies and a potential end to geopolitical conflict under Trump. His forecast comes amid a slew of increased optimism among top minds on Wall Street. The stock market euphoria sparked by Donald Trump's victory is set to last, according to market veteran Ed Yardeni. Yardeni on Monday reiterated his forecast for the S&P 500 to hit 10,000 by the end of the decade, a 66% gain from current levels. He also upped his year-end forecast for 2024 to 6,100, implying a 1.8% gain. The long-time forecaster pointed to heightened odds of a \"Roaring 20s\" scenario after Trump's win—and a likely Republican sweep of Congress—fueled a rally that carried stocks to their best week of the year. He says the \"animal spirits\" that fueled last week's big gains will likely continue to boost investor sentiment as the President-Elect unveils more pro-business policies. \"We believe these forecasts are consistent with our Roaring 2020s scenario, which is receiving a boost from the animal spirits that should result from Trump 2.0's economic policies,\" Yardeni wrote. Trump's win early last Wednesday has fueled the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average each to record highs, propelled by the \"Trump trade,\" which has sent everything from bitcoin to the dollar to Tesla soaring. Investors are widely expecting Trump's second presidency to bring more business-friendly policies, including less regulation and lower taxes, which will help drive corporate profits higher. As a result, Yardeni says he expects industry analysts to up their S&P 500 earnings estimates, and raises his own from $275 to $285 for 2025, and from $300 to $320 for 2026. Those estimates assume Trump will quickly lower the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, he says. He adds that market optimism could intensify further if the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East get resolved sooner than initially expected. Yet Yardeni warned, too, that the euphoric feeling on Wall Street and stretched valuations in some mega-cap names could set the stage for a difficult comedown if stocks fly too high to fast. \"Animal spirits can be associated with irrational exuberance causing a stock market meltup that could set the stage for a meltdown,\" he said. While he doesn't see a huge risk of a bear market amid the current euphoric sentiment, Yardeni said he does expect to see corrections before the end of the decade, he says.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The derivatives will first trade on Dec. 9, subject to regulatory approval, according to a ICE notice to clients dated Friday. The futures will reflect movements in the ICE 8-13 Year European Union Index, it said. It’s a welcome development for the EU, which has touted a futures market as a way of boosting trading in its debt. While futures are often preferred by investors given they tend to offer better liquidity, it’s far from guaranteed that the newly-launched contract will attract sufficient volumes. “The EU is making another small step towards sovereign-style secondary market trading,” said Rainer Guntermann, a strategist at Commerzbank AG. “It will be interesting to see how liquidity will be building up in this newly-constructed instrument.” The EU ramped up its joint-debt issuance program following the pandemic, and now officials are looking to improve the liquidity of its bonds with the aim of ultimately achieving lower borrowing costs. The bloc has recently launched a repo facility and has been lobbying index providers for inclusion in their larger sovereign-debt benchmarks. That push faced a setback earlier this year when both ICE and MSCI Inc. rejected proposals to include EU debt in government bond benchmarks. Europe’s major sovereign debt issuers including Italy, Germany and France all have futures markets. Rival exchange operator Eurex Clearing AG has previously said it planned to launch futures contracts in late 2024 on bonds sold directly by the European Union. Barclays Plc analysts said the market reaction to futures would be driven by liquidity and whether they end up being used for hedging. “This wouldn’t be the first time a new futures contract is introduced but does not gain traction,” said analysts led by Cristina Costa. --With assistance from James Hirai.

For signs of Trump-trade fatigue, investors should watch the 10-year Treasury yield, JPMorgan says. With market enthusiasm around Donald Trump's presidential-election victory pushing stocks and crypto to record highs, JPMorgan says investors looking for signs of rally fatigue should be watching the Treasury-bond market. In new research, the firm's equity-strategy team said the 5% level on the 10-year Treasury yield could be an inflection point for US equities. It's currently trading at about 4.3%. \"We think that around 5% the impact of bond yields on equity valuations starts to turn, from positive/reflationary one, into the rising concerns over the sustainability of the upcycle and the increasing risk of accidents,\" the team wrote on Monday, led by the firm's head of global equity strategy, Mislav Matejka. Government-bond yields went on a tear following Trump's win on expectations that the president-elect's immigration and protectionist trade policies would drive inflation and force the Federal Reserve to raise rates. The 10-year note surged as much as 21 basis points to 4.47% on Wednesday, the day after the election. Adding to upward pressure on bond yields is the prospect that \"bond vigilantes\" could register their displeasure with a ballooning federal deficit by selling Treasurys. \"If the Trump administration runs excessively stimulative fiscal policy, with lots of spending and tax cuts, leading to even wider deficits, I think then that may cause the bond vigilantes to push yields up to levels that create problems for the economy,\" Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, told DealBook in a newsletter published on Saturday. In the absence of a move above 5% in the 10-year Treasury, JPMorgan said the market's near- to medium-term direction would be dictated by which policies Trump prioritized. JPMorgan said it saw struggles in stocks if the president-elect's second term kicked off with immigration curbs and higher tariffs. Meanwhile, Trump focusing on tax cuts would be a stocks-positive outcome, the firm said. Read the original article on Business Insider ",

Others, like “The Wizard of Lies,” are sobering representations of real events. While these films are entertaining to watch, few contain actionable advice for investors to follow once they exit the theater. There are, however, a few notable exceptions. No single movie can fully educate beginners on the particulars of the stock market, but some contain a few pointers that may be valuable to those hoping to break into the finance world. (Of course, if you are looking for actual financial advice related to your specific situation, you may want to consult a financial advisor.) Here are our top picks for stock market and Wall Street movies that every investor should watch. Each straddles the line between education and entertainment — and doesn’t skimp on either. “Wall Street” may seem like an obvious choice when it comes to movies about the stock market. More than 35 years after its release, it still gives viewers something to think about after the credits roll. The story follows young stockbroker Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen), who works under the morally dubious Wall Street trader Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas). The movie is best known for Gekko’s famous speech in which he says that “greed is good.” Sheen’s character climbs the ladder of success after illegally sharing inside tips with Gekko to curry favor. It works for a while, but he inevitably runs afoul of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and he is ultimately arrested for insider trading. It may seem obvious, but investors would be wise to pay attention to the movie’s lesson for those in the finance sector — don’t become so blinded by greed and ambition that you break the law to get ahead. It may land you in a favorable financial position in the short term, but the law will inevitably catch up with you. Need an advisor?

This portrayal of real-life stockbroker Jordan Belfort is based on his 2007 memoir of the same name. The movie follows Belfort’s rise from innocent, young trader to a predatory scammer. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, who engages in every form of depravity known to man as he gets rich from his criminal behavior. Among the crimes are his use of the pump-and-dump scheme, a type of securities fraud that involves illegally hyping overvalued stocks to unwitting investors in an effort to artificially “pump up” the share price. This activity eventually costs Belfort his freedom.       ",

In several recent columns, I reported on a simple model that correlated the incumbent political party’s chances of retaining the White House with the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s DJIA year-to-date return. Right before the election, that model was giving U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, a strong 70% chance of beating former U.S. President Donald Trump. I inherited $200,000. One of my daughters is married with kids, but the other has debts. Do I split my windfall 50/50? Nvidia’s stock joins the Dow today. Here’s what to know. The S&P 500 breaks 6,000 and the Dow tops 44,000. Here’s why stocks could keep climbing. U.S. stocks staged an epic rally after Trump won the election. What history says could happen before year-end. Why Wall Street may hold the ultimate veto power over Trump budget plans When a model fails, investors should use the occasion to explore what can be learned. Was this just one of those times when a model turns out to be wrong — something that inevitably happens sooner or later because no model works all the time? Or have there been more fundamental changes in the U.S. economy and the financial markets that make the model less useful? With the election now over, my sense is that model’s breakdown has to do with the growing disconnect between Wall Street and the broader economy — what many call the Wall Street-Main Street disconnect. The reason that my simple model worked so well in decades past is that voters tend to vote their pocketbooks and the Dow used to be a decent barometer of overall economic health. This may no longer be true, or at least as true as it once was. To show this, I analyzed quarterly changes in U.S. GDP with quarterly changes in the S&P 500’s SPX earnings per share (EPS) back to 1947. Specifically, I calculated the trailing 20-year correlation coefficient of these quarterly changes. (That coefficient ranges from a theoretical maximum of 100%, which would indicate that GDP and EPS move in perfect lockstep with each other, to a theoretical minimum of minus 100%, which would mean that the two move inversely to each other. A coefficient of zero would mean that the two have no detectable relationship with each other.) The chart above plots what I found. Except for a brief blip in the wake of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when both the GDP and EPS fell in unison, the correlation between the economy and the stock market has been steadily declining for several decades and is currently only marginally higher than zero.

If he enacts his tariff plans, they could lower household income and depress corporate investment. The firm advises pulling back from stocks as interest rates remain in restrictive territory. Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist for BCA Research, said the chances of a US recession had jumped since President-elect Donald Trump's win last week. In a Friday note, Berezin increased the probability of an economic recession to 75% from 65%, citing the risk of a new trade war under Trump. \"The prospect of a new trade war more than offsets the other pro-business parts of Trump's agenda,\" Berezin said. \"With the labor market already weakening going into the election, the odds of a recession have risen.\" On the campaign trail, Trump proposed implementing universal tariffs of 10% to 20% on goods imported into the US and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Berezin said those tariffs would likely depress corporate investment and lower real household disposable income for consumers, which would be an economic double whammy. He cited a study from the Budget Lab at Yale that estimated Trump's proposed tariffs would reduce real disposable income for the median US household by $1,900 to $7,600. Some have speculated that Trump's tariff proposals are empty threats meant to get leverage when negotiating with other countries, but Berezin isn't so sure. \"Whether Trump carries out these threats is open for debate,\" Berezin said. \"The consensus view among market participants is that, for the most part, he will not. Once again, I suspect the consensus is too optimistic.\" And while Trump's proposed tax cuts, if passed, could boost the S&P 500's earnings per share by 4%, that's less than the 5% gain the index saw in the past week, Berezin said. That suggests those proposed tax cuts are already priced into the market. Berezin also expressed concern about the surge in interest rates since Trump's election win, saying that they're at \"restrictive levels\" that could put downward pressure on economic growth. \"The weak state of the housing market is screaming at investors that monetary policy is restrictive,\" Berezin said, highlighting the marked slowdown in housing-sales activity. All of these factors lead Berezin to take a bearish view on the stock market. \"Taken together, these considerations lead us to recommend a modest underweight on stocks,\" Berezin said, adding that he planned to move to a \"max underweight\" recommendation \"once clearer evidence of a recession emerges.\" Read the original article on Business Insider ",

Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The Republican president-elect made plenty of campaign promises: steep tariffs, tax cuts, business-friendly deregulation and tighter immigration laws, to name some. For investors who plowed into stocks last week on speculation Trump’s policies will bolster the economy, the challenge is to figure out which sectors will get a lasting boost. Tariffs, for example, could spark inflation and hurt large multinational firms, while potentially helping domestically oriented small-cap stocks. However, an immigration crackdown risks lifting labor costs, likely squeezing smaller businesses. Meanwhile, a friendly stance toward traditional energy that lifts production might drive down oil prices, and efforts to reverse President Joe Biden’s policies designed to help the clean-energy and electric-vehicle industries could have a hard time getting through Congress. “I expect active investors to start using a scalpel to sift through at industry levels to see which companies and industries might benefit now,” said Eric Clark, a portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors. “In time we will get more data points on what will actually be implemented and how to play that.” Clark has already acted on some opportunities. As banks, industrials, energy and big-technology stocks pushed the equities market higher on Wednesday, he sold some tech and financial shares. He also bought stocks in luxury retail and consumer staples — which were in the red amid the surge. Clearer Picture Small-cap stocks rallied last week, and they appear to be in a sweet spot as traders assess the potential policy backdrop ahead. These companies, which make most of their revenue at home, stand to benefit from heightened protectionism. A possible corporate-tax cut should also help. Trump has proposed a 10% to 20% across-the-board levy on imports, and as high as 60% on China-made goods. The prospect that at least some tariffs will come to fruition helped drive the Russell 2000 Index — a benchmark for small-cap stocks — up 8.6% last week. Digital payments company Sezzle Inc., one of the gauge’s top gainers, doubled during that time. Financial stocks are also seen as being in a strong position, given Trump’s pledge to make changes to regulatory bodies that have pursued tougher banking rules under Biden. As Wells Fargo & Co. bank analyst Mike Mayo sees it, a new era of deregulation could boost Wall Street profitability. Shares of Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. soared on Trump’s victory.                         ",

Is a Trump presidency going to be good or bad for the AI market darling? Has he ever taken CEO Jensen Huang to task on X? Does Jensen feel a certain way about Trump, and perhaps could add headline risk to the company's stock price? All of this matters since, as I mentioned, Nvidia has become the market — even before its inclusion in the former smokestack index known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). The short answer to all of these pressing questions is, who really knows? I can't find a lot. Do an advanced search of Trump's X account, and you do not unearth a single post on Jensen or Nvidia. Scour interviews of Jensen from the prior Trump presidency, and there isn't much for Trump to feast on as he returns to the Oval Office. \"I’m optimistic about the outcome, irrespective of how, on balance, I prefer a more liberal government. I have confidence in the resilience of the institutions. We’ll find a way through and find a way forward,\" Huang said in a November 2016 VentureBeat story following Trump's first White House win. Huang is besties with Tesla (TSLA) CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk, but it's unclear what that means for Nvidia's financial fortunes over the next four years. Chat up investors, and the early vibe is that Nvidia should do just fine, as the factors driving its business are simply too powerful to be snuffed out. \"It's hard to draw a straight line between AI or Nvidia and Trump,\" EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). \"I think there's some interesting ways that AI is kind of infiltrating all corners of tech. But in general, obviously, Trump is very pro-growth, low taxes, and that's going to sweep up all of tech and that includes AI.\" Jackson thinks Nvidia could see stronger demand from the bitcoin mining industry, as Trump may open up the digital asset markets more. Nvidia could also cash in from looser regulations on the energy industry, freeing up hyperscalers to move more quickly with AI infrastructure buildouts, Jackson reasoned. One risk to watch, Jackson said, is if a tariff-induced trade war with China occurs. Nvidia not only sells chips in China but has important product development talent in the country. You also have to keep in mind what this trade war would mean to China's relationship with key chip producer Taiwan.             ",

A closely watched gauge of banks rose 2.4%. Most big techs fell, with Nvidia Corp. down 1.6%. Tesla Inc. jumped 9%, extending a blistering surge. An equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 — where the likes of Apple Inc. carry the same heft as Dollar Tree Inc. — beat the US benchmark. That gauge is less impacted by the largest companies — providing a glimpse of hope the rally will broaden out. “No pre-election stock flips = big post-election trades,” said Savita Subramanian at Bank of America Corp. “Election years - especially big changes on status quo - have tended to see more ‘flips’ in active portfolios. So far this year, clients have been steadfast in positioning, leaving room for additional rotation through year-end from tech to banks/cyclicals, green to brown commodity exposure etc.” With the election and another rate cut in the rear-view mirror, the question is whether bulls can keep pushing the market to new highs, according to Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “Aside from any potential profit-taking after such a strong surge, this week’s inflation data may determine whether the market pads its gains,” Larkin said. US inflation probably moved sideways at best in October, highlighting the uneven path of easing price pressures in the home stretch toward the Fed’s target.

Selina Cheng lost her job in July after a senior editor told her that her position was eliminated due to restructuring. However, Cheng believed the termination was linked to her refusal to comply with her supervisor’s request to withdraw from the election for the chairperson of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, a trade union for journalists that advocates for press freedom. Cheng, now the chair of the association, said in a press briefing that she had sought mediation with her former employer through private channels and legal representatives, but their communication was “not fruitful\" and her former employer refused to reinstate her job. After the failed attempts, Cheng said she would file a civil claim at the Labor Tribunal, saying she had already brought evidence to the city's Labor Department. In a claim form shown to reporters, she stated she was fired unreasonably and illegally and it was due to her participation in a trade union. “If the Wall Street Journal regrets this decision and agree that this wasn't right, there are ways to make repairs, perhaps still,” she said. Cheng said she would meet with the department's investigators on Wednesday “to pursue this as a criminal matter.” She requested them to investigate her ex-employer for what she called “likely” violation of the employment ordinance. Dow Jones, which publishes the newspaper, did not immediately comment. Hong Kong journalists work in a narrowing space after drastic political changes in the city that was once seen as a bastion of media freedom in Asia. After Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020, two local news outlets known for critical coverage of the government, Apple Daily and Stand News, were forced to shut down following the arrest of their senior management, including Apple Daily publisher Jimmy Lai. Lai is expected to testify in his defense next week in his landmark national security trial. Two former editors at Stand News were convicted in August, the first journalists found guilty of sedition since the former British colony returned to China in 1997. One of them received a jail term of 21 months. In March, Hong Kong enacted another security law, sparking worries among many journalists over a further decline in media freedom. The termination of Cheng's contract in July sent shockwaves among Hong Kong's media workers. Cheng on Tuesday said her former employer insisted her job loss was a result of redundancy.    ",

His approach is more cautious than ever and Berkshire Hathaway's eye-popping $325 billion cash stockpile is the outcome of his latest strategy. While investors have long emulated Buffett's moves, his latest decisions have raised eyebrows. This caution speaks volumes for a man known for his optimism in the U.S. economy. Don't Miss: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000 $100K Sitting In A CD Account, Should I Move Money Into The Stock Market? For the past eight quarters, Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of equities, raking in $166 billion by off-loading massive amounts of stock, including longtime favorites, like Apple and Bank of America. The scale of these sales is unprecedented, as it's the first time since 2018 that Buffett hasn't bought back any of Berkshire's stock – a move that hasn't gone unnoticed in the financial community. This stance hints at one thing: Buffett sees the market as significantly overvalued. Much of this cash isn't being reinvested in the stock market but rather parked in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. Thanks to high yields, these low-risk investments have earned Berkshire close to $10 billion. Trending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date. Cathy Seifert, an analyst with CFRA, recently pointed out that Buffett's reduction in Apple holdings is a prudent move, especially since Apple had grown into a massive chunk of Berkshire's portfolio. However, this pivot to treasuries instead of stocks signals that Buffett sees limited bargains on Wall Street – a stance that echoes his famous \"buy low\" philosophy. Still, some analysts feel Buffett's caution could be a missed opportunity. Cash yields may fall if the Federal Reserve begins to ease interest rates, making equities more attractive. In that case, Berkshire's heavy cash position could mean missed gains if the market rebounds.                  ",

        "body": "On Saturday, Denmark-based ALK entered into a strategic license agreement with ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPRY). The agreement grants ALK exclusive global rights to the neffy adrenaline (epinephrine) nasal spray, except in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China. In August, the FDA approved ARS Pharmaceuticals’ Neffy (epinephrine nasal spray) for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I), including those that are life-threatening (anaphylaxis), for adult and pediatric patients. Neffy is also approved in Europe. Submission for regulatory approval in Canada is planned for by the end of 2024. ARS Pharma is also developing its intranasal adrenaline (epinephrine) technology for acute flares in patients with chronic urticaria, with plans to begin a Phase 2b trial in 2025. The license agreement gives ALK exclusive rights for new indications in the licensed territories. ALK will initially focus on bringing Neffy to Europe and Canada, the world’s second and third-largest adrenaline autoinjector markets. In both markets, the product can be added to ALK’s existing infrastructure and sales channels. The agreement also holds potential in other markets, e.g., Asia and the Middle East. ALK estimates that Neffy holds a long-term annual peak sales potential in anaphylaxis of up to 3 billion Danish Kroner (around $430 million) in the licensed territories. There may be substantial upsides to this potential from new indications, e.g., urticaria. Under the agreement, ARS Pharma is entitled to receive an upfront payment of $145 million (1 billion Danish kroner) from ALK. Furthermore, ARS Pharma may receive up to $320 million (2.2 billion Danish Kroner) related to regulatory and commercial milestones, potentially over the next 15+ years as well as tiered royalties in the teens on future sales. ARS Pharma will supply finished goods to ALK, while ALK will be responsible for local market access, marketing and sales. The first launches are expected to take place in Europe in 2025 once local market access negotiations are completed. William Blair highlights that ARS Pharmaceuticals’ stock has jumped more than 200% this year but believes there is still room for more growth. The firm points to a strong launch of Neffy, which could surpass current market expectations as the main driver. The analyst notes that survey results indicate significant demand for neffy in the near future. Early-stage payer coverage has been better than expected, supporting a solid launch through 2025. With Neffy standing out as an approved, unique product, the analyst expects a strong commercial rollout and blockbuster-level peak sales.          ",

        "body": "Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) closed more than 4% higher Monday after surging 15% on Friday following news that Donald Trump would not sell his shares in the company. Trump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account Friday afternoon, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, the parent company of Truth Social. At Monday's closing level of around $33 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $7.2 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth over $4.3 billion. Shares in the company have been on a wild ride since Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election, oscillating between highs and lows. In September, shares in Trump Media traded at their lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. The stock eventually bounced back from its lows as both domestic and overseas betting markets began to shift in favor of a Trump victory. According to analytics company S3 Partners, DJT short sellers, or traders who bet the stock's price will fall, are down $22.2 million in mark-to-market losses since Nov. 4. \"Although we had been seeing increased short selling in DJT stock ahead of the election, we have been seeing short covering since the election with 1.26 million shares, worth $392 million, bought to cover since Nov. 4,\" S3 Partners head of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky told Yahoo Finance. \"We expect continued short covering in DJT stock if the rally continues and heads back towards its recent $51.51 high, the ensuing short squeeze which will force out many of the 1.7 million shares we saw shorted over the last month ahead of the election,\" Dusaniwsky added. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, just a few hours before the election polls closed, DJT dropped third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period.    ",

However, AI enthusiasm will drive the S&P 500 to reach 7,000 at the end of 2025, the firm said. Trump's tax, deregulation, and tariff proposals might disappoint the market. Donald Trump's policies could disappoint the stock market, but that won't stop another key catalyst from helping the S&P 500 soar to new highs, Capital Economics said. While investors seem convinced that Trump offers the best outcome for stocks, the research firm pushed back on this idea. Bullish momentum should still drive indexes sky-high next year, but that will only reflect ceaseless enthusiasm for artificial intelligence rather than a boost from new policies. By the firm's estimates, the S&P will surge to around 7,000 by the end of next year, indicating about 15% upside from current levels. \"However, this has nothing to do with the policies we expect will be delivered,\" Capital Economics said. \"In fact, we think these will be negative for equities, as Trump's second term proves to be neither 'pro-growth' nor 'pro-business.'\" While the market's post-election reaction was euphoric, Capital Economics suggested that investors look more closely at Trump's plans, their likelihood of becoming reality, and the potential impact on the economy. On the one hand, Trump may be unable to deliver on promised tax cuts even with a Republican Congress. \"The bottom line is that without a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, Trump would be forced to rely on the convoluted budget reconciliation process. A likely single-digit majority in the House will complicate the process,\" Capital Economics wrote in a separate note on Friday. Additionally, Republican legislators may fear negative bond market reactions if tax cuts are pursued, as traders have grown increasingly concerned about rising US debt. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped sharply after Trump's victory as the market priced in higher interest rates, higher government spending, and higher inflation under Trump. There's also room to doubt Trump's push for deregulation, a promise that has helped drive financial stocks higher. Capital Economics said that Trump had made the same claims of massive deregulation in 2016, with little long-term impact on the market. Finally, the research firm said it considers Trump's tariff and immigration policy to be net negatives for the economy. Though it remains to be seen if the President-elect will stick to his promise for a 10%-20% universal tariff on all imports to the US, this is enough to weigh on company profit and prospects, the note said.

        "body": "The Q3 earnings season for the tech giants has been a mixed bag. While some managed to impress investors with their performance and outlook, others fell short of expectations on some metrics. Wall Street remains upbeat on several tech giants, thanks to generative AI (artificial intelligence)-led tailwinds. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Meta Platforms (META), Uber Technologies (UBER), and Amazon (AMZN) against each other to find the “Strong Buy” stock with the highest upside potential, according to Wall Street analysts. Social media giant Meta Platforms reported better-than-expected Q3 revenue and earnings for the third quarter of 2024. The company’s top line grew 19% year-over-year to $40.5 billion, while EPS (earnings per share) rose 37% to $6.03. However, shares fell after the earnings report as investors were disappointed with Meta’s subdued user numbers. Daily active people (DAP), which indicates the number of users who visited at least one of the family apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp) on a given day, increased 5% to 3.29 billion but lagged analysts’ consensus of 3.31 billion. Moreover, the company increased its capital expenditure guidance for 2024, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg cautioning investors about a significant rise in AI infrastructure capex in 2025. Following the Q3 print, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reaffirmed a Buy rating on META stock and increased the price target to $630 from $605. The analyst believes that the company’s strong Q3 results reflect a stable macro backdrop, healthy user growth and engagement trends, and the benefits of AI in ad products and content recommendations. He expects AI to drive further growth for Meta Platforms in the days ahead. Like Sebastian, most analysts are bullish on Meta Platform’s prospects. META stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average META stock price target of $654.23 implies 11% upside potential. Shares have rallied 66.5% year-to-date. See more META analyst ratings Uber Technologies stock fell 9.3% on October 31, as the company reported slower-than-expected bookings growth and triggered concerns among investors about the impact of macro pressures on the demand in the ride-hailing industry. The company’s gross bookings grew 16% year-over-year to $40.97 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimate of $41.25 billion. On the positive side, Uber’s Q3 revenue increased 20% to $9.29 billion and surpassed estimates. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) jumped to $1.20 from $0.10 in the prior-year quarter, reflecting the inclusion of a $1.7 billion benefit from unrealized gains related to the reevaluation of its equity investments.

The France-based ocean carrier saw revenue increase 38.5 percent to $15.8 billion in its third quarter on a net income of $2.7 billion—skyrocketing from the $388 million in the year prior. The company carried 5.5 percent more volume than the year prior, moving 6 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs). More from Sourcing Journal A Trump Victory Signals a Wave of Imports Ahead of Expected Tariffs A Year Later, Houthis Show No Sign of Curbing Red Sea Attacks Maersk CEO Doesn't Expect US Election to Sway Container Demand Revenue from maritime shipping operations made up the lion’s share of CMA CGM’s sales, amounting to $10.9 billion over the quarter, up 43.4 percent from third quarter 2023. “Container shipping continued to enjoy steady momentum, with sustained demand giving rise to an early peak season characterized by high volumes,” CMA CGM said. “This reflected signs of accelerating global trade, which rebounded from the prior-year period as inflation slowed over the third quarter.” Drewry’s World Container Index illustrates the main reason the container shipping companies have generated such a massive profit payout. The WCI is up 129 percent year over year to $3,444 per 40-foot container, impacted largely by the mass rerouting of container ships around southern Africa’s Cape of Good Hope in response to the ongoing Red Sea crisis that began last November. Both Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd raised their earnings guidance multiple times in recent months due to the strength in freight rates in 2024, alongside strong demand in the container market. CMA CGM didn’t offer a guidance for the year, but shared its expectations in its third quarter results. “After a very volatile 2024, 2025 will be shaped by many sources of uncertainty as macroeconomic trends, regulatory changes and geopolitical challenges may continue to weigh on the fluidity of maritime shipping and logistics,” said the company. “At the same time, new container shipping capacity will come into service. This may disrupt the balance between supply and demand and continue to hamper freight rates, in line with the recent trend.” Already with the third-most ships across all ocean carriers at an estimated 648, according to Alphaliner, CMA CGM has an estimated 81 more vessels in its orderbook. The earnings results come as the container shipping company determined it would still, by and large, avoid traveling through the Red Sea. Although CMA CGM sought to return to the Suez Canal via its Indamex service in late November, the ocean carrier has already reneged on the decision.           ",

Proponents point to a number of factors that make betting markets more accurate. They say the public could start trusting prediction markets more if polls don't improve. In the weeks before Donald Trump's victory, polling showed the former president locked in a dead heat with Vice President Kamala Harris. Prediction markets, though, told a different story. Trump started showing a solid lead on betting markets like Polymarket, PredictIt, and Kalshi in mid-October, and those odds mostly rose in the weeks before Election Day. The odds slightly narrowed in the few days before, but by the time the first major polls closed at 6 p.m. ET Tuesday evening, the markets showed around 60% odds for Trump. They reacted quickly amid a slew of outcomes from individual states, and by 1:30 AM on Wednesday, they predicted over 98% chances of a Trump win, according to the Election Betting Odds tool. That was still hours before major news outlets called the election Prediction site founders and researchers have long argued that betting markets are more accurate than traditional polling. This week was the biggest demonstration to back up that claim. \"They've always been accurate. They just got a lot more interest now,\" Tarek Mansour, cofounder of prediction market Kalshi, told Business Insider. Kalshi is the only betting site for US users to wager on political races. Kalshi saw a huge influx of traffic the night of the election, with 123 million site views in the 24 hours before the race was officially called, he said. Those numbers point to a growing sense of trust in betting markets among voters, which will help platforms like Kalshi gain mainstream prominence, Mansour says. \"I don't think we're going back. I think this is the dawn of a new era for prediction markets, and prediction markets are here to stay,\" Mansour said. \"People are not going to go back to mainstream news and polls after this. Prediction markets are basically the ultimate thing that people are going to look at now,\" he added. Betting experts say prediction markets have a few key advantages over polls, and much of it comes down to the motivation behind the participants: rather than asking who a voter wants to win, prediction markets ask who they think will win. Putting money on the line—potentially tens of millions in the case of one French trader—means participants have to be very confident in their prediction. That means those with high conviction and potentially better information are especially drawn to the sites.                ",

Now, with Donald Trump headed back to the White House, Republicans retaking the Senate, and the House likely staying in GOP control, a decade of bullish returns not only looks more probable, it could have longer legs. \"Indeed, it increases the odds that the good times will continue through the end of the decade and possibly into the 2030s,\" Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note on Wednesday. This decade is already off to a strong start. Except for a down year in 2022, when the Federal Reserve began an aggressive rate-hiking cycle, the S&P 500 has notched double-digit returns each year and is already up nearly 26% so far in 2024. That comes after markets had their best week in a year, soaring after Trump's decisive win with a Republican sweep looking likely. For the week, the S&P 500 finished up 4.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.6%, the Nasdaq jumped 5.7%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 soared 8.6% as investors bet on lower taxes and deregulation juicing the economy further. \"We're sticking with our investment recommendation to Stay Home rather than to Go Global,\" Yardeni wrote. \"In other words, overweight the US in global stock portfolios.\" Of course, the Roaring 20s from a century ago infamously ended with the stock market crash in 1929, which sparked the Great Depression that lasted through the 1930s. And for his part, Yardeni sees other scenarios this century. But his view for a new Roaring 20s is the most likely with 50% odds, while a 1990s-style stock market \"meltup\" has 20% odds, and a 1970s-style geopolitical crisis with a possible US debt crisis has a 30% probability. \"But we are considering raising the odds of the Roaring 2020s scenario as a looser regulatory environment and lower corporate and income taxes under Trump 2.0 should boost investment and propel productivity-led economic growth,\" he added. Yardeni has also been warning about \"bond vigilantes\" sending yields higher as the outlook for U.S. debt and deficits continues to deteriorate. Trump's tax cuts and tariffs are also seen as inflationary, limiting the Fed's ability to cut rates further. But Scott Bessent, who has been floated as a possible Treasury secretary under Trump, has noted that lower energy prices and deregulation are disinflationary and could offset the potential inflationary effects of higher tariffs.

If you see weakness in the space, it’s a fantastic opportunity.” The more niche nature of these credits — not all investors can dip into, let alone load up on, junk-rated debt from emerging nations due to liquidity or rating concerns — comes in handy at a shaky time for risk assets. On Wednesday, the day after Trump secured his return to the White House, dollar notes from Ukraine and El Salvador to Ecuador and Argentina rallied. The gains stood out in a volatile session for markets. A soaring dollar and rising US yields sent an index of emerging-market currencies to its worst day since February 2023. Eastern European currencies spiraled and the Mexican peso sank as much as 3.3% before rebounding. Investors are still trying to gauge paths for global interest rates and the dollar under a new Trump administration, whose policy promises are largely seen as stoking inflation in the world’s largest economy. Moreover, Trump’s tariffs plans will likely take a disproportionate toll on some of the larger emerging markets, such as Mexico and China.                               ",

Additionally, in light of recent and persistent speculation, Cigna confirmed that it is not pursuing a combination with Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM). “The Cigna Group remains committed to its established M&A criteria and would only consider acquisitions that are strategically aligned, financially attractive, and have a high probability to close,” the company added. During these meetings, Cigna expects to reaffirm its projected full-year 2024 consolidated adjusted EPS outlook of at least $28.40 per share and growth of at least 10% in 2025. In October, the company reported third-quarter sales of $63.7 billion, up 30% year-over-year, beating the consensus of $59.35 billion. Adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 5%, reflecting strong contributions from Evernorth Health Services, particularly within Specialty and Care Services, partially offset by lower net investment income.

The deal could expand Cigna’s footprint in Medicare Advantage alongside its commercial insurance prowess while leveraging Humana’s strong Medicare segment. Last year, both companies faced challenges as they navigated federal pressures to reduce Medicare costs, severely impacting Humana’s market performance and valuation. Cigna said it continues to deliver shareholder value through focused execution against stated operational and financial targets and via disciplined capital deployment, including dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, the company has repurchased $6 billion of stock, including $1 billion thus far in the fourth quarter. Cigna expects to continue actively repurchasing its shares in the fourth quarter and 2025. It will use the majority of proceeds from the sale of its Medicare businesses, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, for share repurchase and has $5.3 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization.

The bank cited Trump's proposed tax cuts for corporations as an upside risk to its EPS forecast. It said each percentage-point cut in the tax rate could boost earnings by slightly less than 1%. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tax cuts could boost S&P 500 earnings by more than 20%, Goldman Sachs said. Strategists at the investment bank argued that S&P 500 earnings per share were on track to rise by about 20% over the next two years. Goldman's forecast for full-year 2024 S&P 500 EPS is $241, followed by an 11% increase in 2025 and a 7% increase the following year, to $288 a share. But the investment bank said in a note on Friday that those targets could be surpassed if Trump slashes taxes for corporations, adding that the latest election results had increased the upside potential of its forecast. \"Tax reform is an upside risk,\" the firm said. \"President-elect Trump has campaigned on cutting the statutory domestic corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. We estimate that each 1 percentage point reduction in the statutory domestic tax rate would boost S&P 500 EPS by slightly less than 1%, all else equal.\" A move to loosen regulation in the financial sector could bring additional earnings. Stocks rallied sharply on Wednesday after Trump secured his second term in office. Bank of America said that traders poured $20 billion into US stocks, marking the largest single-day stock-purchasing boom in five months, and that weekly flows to financial funds hit $2.9 billion, the largest single-day inflow on record. Trump's plans to levy hefty tariffs, though, is a risk to corporate earnings, Goldman said. Its strategists estimated that each 5-percentage-point increase in the effective US tariff rate could reduce S&P 500 EPS growth by as much as 2%. The firm pegged the odds that Trump will follow through with his 10%-to-20% blanket tariff on US imports at 40%. \"During the 2018-2019 trade conflict, companies were generally able to pass the costs of tariffs through to customers,\" strategists wrote, referring to Trump's trade war with China in his first term. \"However, even if that dynamic were repeated, tariffs could potentially reduce earnings via weaker consumer spending, retaliatory tariffs on US exports, and increased uncertainty.\" Economists have described Trump's economic plan as inflationary and said his policies, including his tariff plan, are likely to send interest rates higher.

Days later, he popped up on a social media post from Abu Dhabi’s $1.5 trillion man, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The $11.5 trillion asset manager Fink runs recently received approval to set up its regional headquarters in Riyadh. It’s also teaming up with the Abu Dhabi royal on one of the largest efforts to date to bankroll the build-out of data warehouses and energy infrastructure. The biggest firms on Wall Street operate across geographies and top executives often fly to multiple countries while visiting a region. But Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, which are competing to be the Middle East’s main business hub, offer unique opportunities: The cities control over $1 trillion in sovereign wealth each, making them among the biggest pools of capital in the world. Sheikh Tahnoon — one of Abu Dhabi’s two deputy rulers, the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser and brother to its president — had conversations with many executives who also spoke at the FII, according to posts on the royal’s X profile. That list included Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick, Blackstone Inc.’s Steve Schwarzman and Ruth Porat of Alphabet Inc., which is partnering with Saudi Arabia on an artificial intelligence hub. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon also dropped by in Abu Dhabi shortly after his firm announced its new Riyadh office, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two cities have rolled out a series of initiatives in their quest for greater global relevance. Riyadh is asking international firms to boost their local presence, or risk losing business. That’s prompted the likes of General Atlantic and Goldman to beef up their operations in the kingdom. Some others have been reluctant about making Riyadh their main hub because their employees prefer the lifestyle in the UAE. To further sweeten the deal, Abu Dhabi has also rolled out a series of perks, including a lifestyle-support program for incoming financiers. But many firms looking to raise cash or plug into dealmaking driven by ambitious diversification programs are trying to keep a foot in both camps. BlackRock, for instance, said its new Riyadh base will help the firm expand operations across the Middle East and not just in the kingdom. Goldman continues to have a significant presence in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and Barclays Plc, which is considering re-entering Saudi Arabia after a decade, said it intends to grow its team in the UAE as well.

The rebrand, which was unveiled at China's biggest air show in Zhuhai on Tuesday, features C909 painted in white on a blue tail. \"After careful consideration, a long gestation and asking opinions of many involved parties, we chose to use C909 as a new commercial name to build the brand,\" Zhang Xiaoguang, COMAC's marketing director, told reporters. The C909 has also reduced weight, resistance and noise and made some improvements in flying costs compared to the previously marketed ARJ21, staff at COMAC's air show booth told Reuters. COMAC has launched the rebrand with the English slogan \"Old friend, New look\", and a Chinese slogan that can be translated as \"meeting an old friend for the first time\". COMAC's ARJ21 regional jet was China's first jet engine-powered plane to reach commercial production, entering service in 2016. Signs of the possible new name for the ARJ21 came in mid-October when one was spotted by aviation enthusiasts at a Chinese airport with C909 painted on its blue tail. The tail design and C909 name correspond with the green tail and white lettering of COMAC's C919 narrow-body jet that has been in service since 2023, and the red tail of its planned wide-body C929 which is under design. The change signals Beijing's growing intention to present itself as a full-scale alternative to Airbus and Boeing, which are both struggling to keep up with demand. There are around 124 ARJ21s in operation, according to ch-aviation data, with various Chinese airlines and also Indonesian carrier TransNusa, COMAC's only overseas operator so far. A sign at its air show booth said COMAC had delivered 150 of the jets to 11 customers. Hainan Airlines, said on Monday its low-cost subsidiary Urumqi Air would order 40 ARJ21-700 jets for delivery between 2025 and 2032. Hainan said the basic list price of each ARJ21 is $38 million but substantial discounts will be applied, a process typical for aircraft purchases.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration That’s due to expectations that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba may cut taxes to keep smaller parties on side — increasing workers’ disposable income — and because both the ruling coalition and its most likely allies want to restart more of Japan’s nuclear reactors. The outlook for other sectors is less clear. Defense-related shares face risks from parliamentary division over how to fund a planned increase in military spending. Investors also worry that a more fractured government will be slower to make decisions, delaying key moves like corporate governance reforms and trade negotiations with an upcoming Trump administration in the US. “With the ruling parties now in a minority, they’ll have no choice but to coordinate with the opposition,” said Yuko Iizuka, an economist at Asset Management One. While this raises risks of parliamentary instability, the increased bargaining power of opposition lawmakers pushing for higher consumer incomes will be a positive for businesses, she said. Ishiba was confirmed as the prime minister of a minority government in a special parliamentary vote on Monday, after his ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, Komeito, lost their majority for the first time since 2009 in October’s lower-house election. AI-related stocks could see long-term upsides from Ishiba’s re-election, after he promised a ¥10 trillion ($65.1 billion) aid package for artificial intelligence and semiconductors by 2030 following Monday’s vote. But to proceed with policies, Ishiba will have to rely on the support of like-minded opposition groups, particularly the Democratic Party for the People, which quadrupled its seats in the election on a promise to introduce tax breaks for low-income workers. Shares of chip component maker Renesas Electronics Corp. climbed 8.2% on Tuesday, boosted by Ishiba’s aid pledge and speculation that the company might gain market share from US rival Monolithic Power Systems Inc. Other chip-related stocks, including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp., declined on weak US tech shares overnight. Japan’s broader Topix Index was up 0.1% as of market close in Tokyo, while the Nikkei 225 fell 0.4%, as stocks fluctuated on uncertainty over US and domestic politics.                    ",

All that is bringing back an issue that has long haunted these opaque holdings: No one is quite sure how to actually measure their performance. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Barry Griffiths is one of a small group of quantitative analysts giving it a try. He’s the driving force behind an alternative method for gauging unlisted investments that he says has the potential to demystify the world of private markets, from buyout funds to venture capital. The claim is it will help investors compare returns with those of other asset classes, as well as reveal the true value provided by managers in the business along the way. That’s a controversial prospect in an industry famous for grading its own homework in terms of performance and for awarding itself generous pay based on the results. Not to mention that successfully decoding such illiquid investments is fraught with pitfalls, as anyone modeling mortgage bonds and derivatives before the financial crisis would probably testify. Yet the rewards of success could be huge: Private equity commanded $10.6 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $25.1 trillion by 2033, according to estimates from Bain & Co. “It’s not easy to understand the risks you’re taking,” says Griffiths, the former head quant at private-asset giant Ares Management. The lack of transparency is one reason systematic investors and analysts like him remain few and far between in the industry, because the data they rely on is in short supply. But as competition grows and market pressures mount, quant ideas are gaining more traction—in particular “direct alpha,” the approach devised by Griffiths and his peers. Alpha—a measure of a portfolio manager’s returns on top of the broader market—is a familiar concept in finance. It’s become a common tool in equities, where indexes such as the S&P 500 provide an obvious benchmark for performance. A huge amount of capital shifted into low-cost, passively managed funds at the expense of human stockpickers after it became clear that few managers consistently achieve alpha. It takes far fancier statistical footwork to do anything similar in private markets, where valuations are infrequent and largely decided by the managers of funds.                          ",

        "body": " Coinbase shares surged 20% to a three-year high Monday as investors bet that higher trading volumes and a more favorable regulatory environment under the incoming Trump Administration could benefit the crypto exchange. The stock broke out above the top trendline of a seven-month descending channel last week on above-average volume, with follow-through buying continuing into this week. Investors should watch key overhead levels on the Coinbase chart around $369, $430, and $695, while monitoring an important support area near $220.  Coinbase (COIN) shares surged to a three-year high Monday as investors bet that higher trading volumes and a more favorable regulatory environment under the incoming Trump Administration could benefit the crypto exchange. The move comes as Bitcoin (BTCUSD) set another record high on Monday above $88,000, and Ether (ETHUSD), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, rose to a multi-year peak. Rising cryptocurrency prices boost Coinbase by generating more trading activity, which in turn boosts the company’s revenues through increased fees. Looking ahead, Coinbase could also benefit from a new digital asset regulatory framework proposed by Republican senator Tim Scott, who is expected chair the Senate’s Banking Committee after the GOP regained control of the upper chamber following the election, a development that would reduce compliance requirements for crypto trading and custody platforms. Coinbase shares rose 20% during the regular trading session Monday, before rising nearly 3% in extended trading to around $333. Below, we break down the technicals on the Coinbase weekly chart and point out key price levels other investors may be watching out for. Since forming a textbook inverse head and shoulders bottoming pattern over a 12-month period between June 2022 and 2023, Coinbase shares have tracked mostly higher. More recently, the stock traded within a seven-month descending channel before staging a decisive breakout above the pattern’s upper trendline last week, with follow-through buying continuing into this week. Importantly, last week’s breakout occurred on the highest volume since early March, signaling strong conviction from larger market participants behind the move. Let’s identify key overhead levels on the Coinbase chart that investors may be watching and also point out an important support area to monitor during retracements. The first higher level to watch sits around $369, a location on the chart where investors who have bought Coinbase shares at lower prices could seek to lock in profits near the prominent November 2021 peak.

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Corporate earnings are set to become one of the biggest drivers of US stocks as investor focus returns to economic growth following Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration With the third-quarter reporting season in its final stage, S&P 500 companies have posted an 8.4% increase in profits — double the expected increase, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Wall Street is even more optimistic for next year, as analysts expect earnings to jump 13% in the biggest increase since 2021, according to BI. For strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., that bodes well for stocks at a time when the Federal Reserve has taken a “balanced” view on growth and inflation risks. “We expect earnings will be the primary driver of forward equity returns,” strategist David Kostin wrote in a note dated Nov. 8. The America-first trade — buying up assets that win when the US outperforms the rest of the world — sent the S&P 500 to a record last week on bets Trump is set to unleash polices that will spur growth and insulate the world’s largest economy from overseas competition. The Fed also cut interest rates, with policymakers noting that inflation had “made progress” toward the central bank’s goal. Still, Trump’s idea of imposing a 10% to 20% tariff on all goods coming from abroad is also a key concern for investors given the threat of retaliatory moves and reduced consumer spending, while Trump’s protectionist stance could reignite inflation. With the benchmark S&P 500 up 26% this year — poised for its biggest increase since 2021 — some market participants warn that both equity exposure and valuations are stretched. Normalizing Revisions Consistent earnings downgrades since September have also stoked worries about next year’s estimates, but Goldman’s Kostin said the trajectory of revisions was returning to “normal” after remaining unusually strong in the first eight months of 2024. The strategist estimates that each 1 percentage point reduction in the statutory domestic tax rate would lift S&P 500 earnings-per-share by slightly less than 1%. He also sees support from potential deregulation, while tariffs could crimp profits. At RBC Capital Markets LLC, strategist Lori Calvasina warned of a possible decline in stocks over the coming weeks as “there’s not much capacity to absorb disappointing news.”         ",

        "body": "Stocks notched their best week of the year as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda. “Tax cuts are behind the rally … and in general, there is the perception that markets like Republican administrations, although certainly the performance for the past few years of the Democratic administration has not exactly been shabby,” Interactive Brokers' Steve Sosnick explained to me on Yahoo Finance's special election coverage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) skyrocketed more than 1,700 points from Wednesday through Friday, closing the week up 4.6%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged to a record, while the Russell 2000 (^RUT) hit its highest level since November 2021. But the market should be careful what it wishes for. Experts tell me as clarity emerges, a resurgence in inflation from trade tariffs and additional government spending could pose a risk to the market’s momentum and temper rate cuts from the Fed. “The sharp spike [in the markets] is, to some extent, a reaction to the expectation of solid growth, deregulation, tax cuts … But the other part of that, of course, is that it can lead to greater inflation and wider fiscal deficits,” Sonal Desai, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income chief investment officer, told me on Catalysts. Stifel’s Barry Bannister, who sees a downside risk of 5,250 for the S&P 500 a year from now, is keeping a close watch for a resurgence in inflation. S&P closed out the week above 6,000. \"If inflation proves resurgent … we suspect Chairman Powell's last 12 months in office (May 2025 to May 2026) are a significant investor risk, magnified by the repercussions of the approaching 2026 US midterm elections,\" Bannister wrote in a note to clients. Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner echoed the point on a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast (listen in below). Deutsche Bank anticipates Trump’s fiscal, trade, and immigration policies could result in an upward adjustment to its inflation forecast. The team, led by Matthew Luzzetti, projects inflation could rise by roughly 0.5% in 2026 to about 2.5%, primarily due to the inflationary impact of tariffs. Reports Friday that Trump asked Robert Lighthizer to return to his administration as US trade Representative could signal a more aggressive approach to tariffs. During Trump’s first term, Lighthizer played a key role in his escalating trade war with China, implemented tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and helped renegotiate the US's trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.
